victory in every deployment.", "We've had more deployments in four years than any previous four years I can think of, and I'm 61 years of age.", "It's unbelievable that ambiguity can be called foreign

United States toward the repulsing of Saddam Hussein from Kuwait, three times as he's tried to get out of that box, Saddam Hussein has felt the sting of a swift, certain response from the United States of America under President Bill Clinton.", " Well, it was Bob Dole that suggested that there be a fact-finding commission.", "President Carter was on it.", "Colin Powell was on it.", "You cannot say, in our opinion, that Haiti is a great success.", "Clearly, uh it was maybe the right thing to do, but we did not go in with enough information.", "We caused problems in the first place by denying Caribbean countries and third-world countries a chance to trade freely in the United States.", "It causes economic problems and turmoil, and then we turn around, as we did in Mexico, having to

Clinton dispatched our troops from Ft. Bragg.", "It was a tense moment.", "The planes were in the air and our negotiators were talking with the dictator down there.", "And when that dictator got the news from his spies outside the gate

anywhere in the annals of the history of this country.", "I was so proud of our President in the way he handled that, and the result, so far, is excellent.", "And we hope and pray that it will remain

talking about the Golden Rule, I thought he was going to talk about the gold standard again.", "That used to be an integral part of this so-called \"Supply Side Economics,\" but it may be something else that he now agrees with Bob Dole on, because Bob Dole voted to take us off the gold standard, a wise vote in my opinion.", "Most -- all economists say that if we did that, it would throw us into a deep recession or depression and put millions out of work, but let me come directly to this question.", "No, when there was a crisis involving the Mexican peso, again, President Bill Clinton showed bold and dynamic leadership.", "I want to hasten to add that Senator Bob Dole gave critical bipartisan support at the time.", "He agreed with the President.", "He supported the President.", "He said this is a wise move.", "He could not get a majority in the Senate, and Speaker Gingrich could not get a majority in the house to go on record in support of it.", "So, the President, as presidents

loss of the standard of living, the people who have had to come across the border of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas if that's our foreign policy for the third-world or Latin America, I

stronger.", "They're coming back.", "They paid us back, and we got a dividend in the process.", " I don't think, Jim, that Bob Dole was suggesting that the defense of our country is a jobs or a socioeconomic program, but it's clear that the defense budget of this administration has taken defense as a percent of our national economy to a lower level than it was prior to Pearl Harbor.", "That's dangerous and it's provocative.", "And the mixed message, the ambiguities of U.S. foreign policy, uh are -- I believe, and Bob Dole believes, is causing not only problems for this country throughout the world, but particularly here at home.", "And the type of changes that were made overnight in California caused very severe dislocations.", "And then, of course, the President ran out to California and announced, well, maybe we'll have another B-1or B-2 Bomber.", "But that is not the way policy should be made.", "It should be predicated upon the defense needs, the security needs, the strategic needs of the United States of America, and that's how they'll be made under Bob Dole as president.", " Well, first of all, there are virtually no large differences in the defense budgets put forward by President Clinton and put forward by the majority in the Congress in the last two years.", "They're very, very similar.", "There is a huge difference in our economic plan.", "This risky $550-billion tax scheme that I talked about earlier is said by the Concord Coalition, including Republicans like Pete Peterson and Warren Rudman, to pose a threat to our nation's ability to have a sensible defense budget in the future.", "They've gone on record as saying that this tax scheme would not only raise taxes on 9 million hard-working American families, but would also lead, almost

Kennedy did, about lowering the rates.", "We can't go to zero.", "They can't go too low, because there's not enough revenue, but President Clinton apologized in Houston for saying, whoops, I raised your taxes and they're too high.", "President Bush apologized for raising taxes.", "Bob Dole knows that the rates have to come down across-the-board and then we'll get to the most important part, to repeal this code and go to a new system for the 21st Century.", " I certainly do.", "Let me first say that.", "In citing John F.

Congress and are included in the Republican platform.", " And so will Bob Dole.", "I mean, Al, get real.", "Franklin Roosevelt said in 1932 that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.", "The only thing, Jim, they have to offer is fear.", "Fear of the environment, fear of the climate, fear of Medicare, fear of Newt, fear of Republicans, fear of Bob, and probably fear of cutting tax rates.", "They ain't seen nothing yet.", "Look, we recognize that this country has to live in balance with our environment.", "Every one of us who have children and grandchildren recognize how we have to reach a balance.", "It is not jobs versus our environment.", "Both are important.", "This is the most overregulated, overly litigated economy in our nation's history.", "And to call a businessman

America has an important choice to make.", "Between two approaches to the future of this country.", "We have a plan that will create millions more jobs, bring the deficits down further and balance the budget, while protecting Medicare, protecting Medicaid, protecting and preserving the environment, our air, our water, the Everglades, the Tongas, the Mojave Desert in California, the Utah-Red Rocks

blessed with a defense capability that's efficient, tough, capable, well organized, narrowly focused - fighting capability.", "The ability to fight, if necessary, is the best way to avoid the chance for, or the requirement to fight.", "And the last point I wanna make is this: Mr. Ford, Mr. Kissinger have uh - continued on with the policies and failures of Richard Nixon.", "Even the Republican platform has criticized the lack of leadership in Mr. Ford and they've criticized the foreign policy of this administration.", "This is one instance where I agree with - with the Republican platform.", "I might say this in closing, and that is that as far as foreign policy goes, Mr. Kissinger has been the president of this country.", "Mr. Ford has shown an absence of leadership, and an absence of a grasp of what this country is and what it ought to be.", "That's got to be changed.", "And that's one of the major issues in this uh - campaign of 1976.", " Governor Carter again is talking in broad generalities.", "Let me take just one question that he raises - the military strength and capability of the United States.", "Governor Carter in November of 1975 indicated that he wanted to cut the defense budget by $15 billion.", "A few months later, he said he wanted to cut the defense budget by eight or nine billion dollars.", "And more recently, he talks about cutting the defense budget by five to seven billion dollars.", "There is no way you can be strong militarily and have those kind of reductions in our military uh - appropriation.", "Now let me just tell you a little story.", "About uh - late October of 1975, I asked the then Secretary of Defense, Mr. Schlesinger, to tell me what had to be done if we were going to reduce the defense budget by uh - three to five billion dollars.", "A few days later, Mr. Schlesinger came back and said if we cut the defense budget by three to five billion dollars, we will have to cut military personnel by two hundred and fifty thousand, civilian personnel by a hundred thousand, jobs in America by a hundred thousand.", "We would have to stretch out our aircraft procurement, we would have to reduce our naval construction program, we would have to reduce the uh - research and development for the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and Marines by 8 percent.", "We would have to close twenty military bases in the United States immediately.", "That's the kind of defense program that uh - Mr. Carter wants.", "Let me tell you this straight from the shoulder.", "You don't negotiate with Mr. Brezhnev from weakness.", "And the kind of defense program that Mr. Carter wants will mean a weaker defense and a poor negotiating position.", " I don't believe we should move to a cold-war relationship.", "I think it's in the best interest of the United States, and the world as a whole that the United States negotiate rather than go back to the cold-war relationship with the Soviet Union.", "I don't uh - look at the picture as bleakly as you have indicated in your question, Mr. Trewhitt.", "I believe that the United States ha- had many successes in recent years, in recent months, as far as the Communist movement is concerned.", "We have been successful in Portugal, where a year ago it looked like there was a very great possibility that the uh - Communists would take over in Portugal.", "It didn't happen.", "We have a democracy in Portugal today.", "A few uh - months ago, or I should say, maybe two years ago, the Soviet Union looked like they had continued strength in the Middle East.", "Today, according to Prime Minister Rabin, the Soviet Union is weaker in the Middle East than they have been in many, many years.", "The facts are, there - the Soviet Union relationship with Egypt is uh - at a low level.", "The Soviet Union relationship with Syria is at a very low point.", "The United States today, according to Prime Minister Rabin of Israel, is a- at a peak in its uh - influence and power in the Middle East.", "But let's turn for a minute to the uhh - southern African operations that are now going on.", "The United States of America took the initiative in southern Africa.", "We wanted to end the bloodshed in southern Africa.", "We wanted to have the right of self-determination in southern Africa.", "We wanted to have majority rule with the full protection of the rights of the minority.", "We wanted to preserve human dignity in southern Africa.", "We have taken the initiative, and in southern Africa today the United States is trusted by the black front-line nations and black Africa.", "The United States is trusted by other elements in southern Africa.", "The United States foreign policy under this administration has been one of progress and success.", "And I believe that instead of talking about Soviet progress, we can talk about American successes.", "And may I make an observation - part of the question you asked, Mr. Trewhitt?", "I don't believe that it's in the best interest of the United States and the NATO nations to have a Communist government in NATO.", "Mr. Carter has indicated he would look with sympathy to a Communist government in NATO.", "I think that would destroy the integrity and the strength of NATO, and I am totally opposed to it.", " Well, Mr. Ford, unfortunately, has just made a statement that's not true.", "I have never advocated a Communist government for Italy.", "That would obviously be a ridiculous thing for anyone to do who wanted to be president of this country.", "I think that this is uh - an instance of uh - deliberate distortion, and this has occurred also in the question about defense.", "As a matter of fact, uh - I've never advocated any cut of $15 billion in our defense budget.", "As a matter of fact, Mr. Ford has made a political football out of the defense budget.", "About a year ago he cut the Pentagon budget six point eight billion dollars.", "After he fired James Schlesinger, the political heat got so great that he added back about $3 billion.", "When Ronald Reagan won the Texas primary election, Mr. Ford added back another one and a half billion dollars.", "Immediately before the Kansas City convention, he added back another one point eight billion dollars in the defense budget.", "And his own uh - Office of Management and Budget testified that he had a $3 billion cut insurance added to the defense budget - defense budget under the pressure from the Pentagon.", "Obviously, this is another indication of trying to use the defense budget for political purposes, which he's trying to do tonight.", "Now, we went into south Africa late, after Great Britain, Rhodesia, the black nations had been trying to solve this problem for many, many years.", "We didn't go in until right before the election, similar to what was taking place in 1972, when Mr. Kissinger announced peace is at hand just before the election at that time.", "And we have weakened our position in NATO because the other countries in Europe supported the democ- democratic forces in Portugal long before we did; we stuck to the Portugal dictatorships much longer than other democracies did in this world.", " Well, I'm not gonna name my cabinet before I get elected.", "I've got a little ways to go before I start doing that.", "But I have uh - an adequate background, I believe.", "I am a graduate of the U.S.", "Naval Academy, the first military graduate since uh - Eisenhower.", "I've served as the Governor of Georgia and have traveled extensively in foreign countries and South America, Central America, Europe, the Middle East and in Japan.", "I've traveled the last twenty-one months among the people of this country.", "I've talked to them and I've listened.", "And I've seen at first hand, in a very vivid way, the deep hurt that's come to this country in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia, Chile, and Pakistan, and Angola, and Watergate, CIA revelations.", "What we were formerly so proud of - the strength of our country, its uh - moral integrity, the representation in foreign affairs of what our people are, what our Constitution stands for, has been gone.", "And in the secrecy that has surrounded our foreign policy in the last few years, uh - the American people, the Congress have been excluded.", "I believe I know what this country ought to be.", "I've uh - been one who's loved my nation as many Americans do, and I believe that there's no limit placed on what we can be in the future, if we can harness the tremendous resources - militarily, economically, and the stature of our people, the meaning of the Constitution, in the future.", "Every time we've made a serious mistake in foreign affairs, it's been because the American people have been excluded from the process.", "If we can just tap the intelligence and ability, the sound common sense and the good judgment of the American people, we can once again have a foreign policy to make us proud instead of ashamed.", "And I'm not gonna exclude the American people from that process in the future, as Mr. Ford and Kissinger have done.", "This is what it takes to have a sound foreign policy strong at home, strong defense, permanent commitments, not betray the principles of our country, and involve the American people and the Congress in the shaping of our foreign policy.", "Every time Mr. Ford speaks from a position of secrecy in negotiations, in secret - in secret treaties that've been uh - pursued and achieved, in supporting dictatorships, in ignoring human rights, we are weak and the rest of the world knows it.", "So these are the ways that we can restore the strength of our country, and they don't require long experience in foreign policy.", "Nobody has that except a president who has served a long time or a secretary of state.", "But my background, my experience, my knowledge of the people of this country, my commitment to our principles that don't change - those are the best bases to correct the horrible mistakes of this administration and restore our own country to a position of leadership in the world.", " First of all, I would quit conducting the decision-making process in secret, as has been a characteristic of Mr. Kissinger and Mr. Ford.", "In many instances we've made agreements, like in Vietnam, uh - that have uh - been revealed later on to our uh - embarrassment.", "Recently Ian Smith, the uh - president of uh - Rhodesia, announced that he had unequivocal commitments from Mr. Kissinger that he could not reveal.", "The American people don't know what those commitments are.", "We've seen uh - in the past the destruction of elected governments, like in Chile, and the strong support of military dictatorship there.", "These kinds of things have hurt us very much.", "I would restore the concept of the fireside chat, which was an integral part of the administration of Franklin Roosevelt.", "And I would also restore the involvement of the Congress.", "When Harry Truman was president he was not afraid to have a strong secretary of defense.", "Dean Acheson, George Marshall were strong secretaries of uh - state - excuse me - state.", "But he also made sure that there was a bipartisan support.", "The members of Congress, Arthur Vandenberg, Walter George, were part of the process, and before our nation made a secret agreement, or before we made a bluffing statement, we were sure that we had the backing not only of the president and the secretary of state, but also of the Congress and the people.", "This is a responsibility of the president.", "And I think it's very damaging to our country for Mr. Ford to have turned over this responsibility to the secretary of state.", " Governor Carter again contradicts himself.", "He complains about secrecy and yet he is quoted as saying that in the attempt to find a solution in the Middle East that he would hold unpublicized meetings with the Soviet Union - I presume for the purpose of an - imposing a settlement on Israel and the Arab nations.", "But let me talk just a minute about what we've done to avoid secrecy in the Ford administration.", "After the United States took the initiative in working with Israel and with Egypt and achieving the Sinai II agreement - and I'm proud to say that not a single Egyptian or Israeli soldier has lost his life since the signing of the Sinai agreement.", "But at the time that uh - I submitted the Sinai agreement to the Congress of the United States, I submitted every single document that was applicable to the Sinai II agreement.", "It was the most complete documentation by any president of any agreement signed by a president on behalf of the United States.", "Now as far as meeting with the Congress is concerned, during the twenty-four months that I've been the president of the United States I have averaged better than one meeting a month with responsible groups or committees of the Congress - both House and Senate.", "The secretary of state has appeared in the several years that he's been the secretary before eighty different uh - committee hearings in the House and in the Senate.", "The secretary of state has made better than fifty speeches all over the United States explaining American foreign policy.", "I have made myself at least ten uh - speeches in various parts of the country where I have discussed with the American people defense and foreign policy.", " I believe that we have uh - negotiated with the Soviet Union since I've been president from a position of strength.", "And let me cite several examples.", "Shortly after I became president in uh - December of 1974, I met with uh - General Secretary Brezhnev in Vladivostok and we agreed to a mutual cap on the ballistic missile launchers at a ceiling of twenty-four hundred - which means that the Soviet Union, if that becomes a permanent agreement, will have to make a reduction in their launchers that they now have or plan to have.", "I've negotiated at Vladivostok with uh - Mr. Brezhnev a limitation on the MIRVing of their ballistic missiles at a figure of thirteen-twenty, which is the first time that any president has achieved a cap either on launchers or on MIRVs.", "It seems to me that we can go from there to uh - the uh - grain sales.", "The grain sales have been a benefit to American agriculture.", "We have achieved a five and three quarter year uh - sale of a minimum six million metric tons, which means that they have already bought about four million metric tons this year and are bound to buy another two million metric tons to take the grain and corn and wheat that the American farmers have produced in order to uh - have full production.", "And these grain sales to the Soviet Union have helped us tremendously in meeting the costs of the additional oil and - the oil that we have bought from overseas.", "If we turn to Helsinki - I'm glad you raised it, Mr. uh - Frankel.", "In the case of Helsinki, thirty-five nations signed an agreement, including the secretary of state for the Vatican - I can't under any circumstances believe that the - His Holiness, the Pope would agree by signing that agreement that the thirty-five nations have turned over to the Warsaw Pact nations the domination of the - Eastern Europe.", "It just isn't true.", "And if Mr. Carter alleges that His Holiness by signing that has done it, he is totally inaccurate.", "Now, what has been accomplished by the Helsinki agreement?", "Number one, we have an agreement where they notify us and we notify them of any uh - military maneuvers that are to be be undertaken.", "They have done it.", "In both cases where they've done so, there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford administration.", " I don't believe, uh - Mr. Frankel that uh - the Yugoslavians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.", "I don't believe that the Rumanians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.", "I don't believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.", "Each of those countries is independent, autonomous: it has its own territorial integrity and the United States does not concede that those countries are under the domination of the Soviet Union.", "As a matter of fact, I visited Poland, Yugoslavia and Rumania to make certain that the people of those countries understood that the president of the United States and the people of the United are dedicated to their independence, their autonomy and their freedom.", " (chuckle) Well, in the first place, I'm not criticizing His Holiness the Pope.", "I was talking about Mr. Ford.", "The uh - fact is that secrecy has surrounded the decisions made by the Ford administration.", "In the case of the Helsinki agreement - it may have been a good agreement at the beginning, but we have failed to enforce the so-called basket three part, which insures the right of people to migrate, to join their families, to be free, to speak out.", "The Soviet Union is still jamming Radio Free Europe - Radio - uh- uh - Radio Free Europe is being jammed.", "We've also seen a very serious uh - problem with the so-called Sonnenfeldt document, which apparently Mr. Ford has just endorsed, which said that there's an organic linkage between the Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union.", "And I would like to see Mr. Ford convince the Polish-Americans and the Czech-Americans and the Hungarian-Americans in this country that those countries don't live under the domination and supervision of the Soviet Union behind the Iron - uh - Curtain.", "We also have seen Mr. Ford exclude himself from access to the public.", "He hasn't had a tough cross-examination-type press conference in over thirty days.", "One press conference he had without sound.", "He's also shown a weakness in yielding to pressure.", "The Soviet Union, for instance, put pressure on Mr. Ford and he refused to see a symbol of human freedom recognized around the world, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.", "The Arabs have put pressure on Mr. Ford, and he's yielded, and has permitted a boycott by the Arab countries of American businesses who trade with Israel, or who have American Jews owning or taking part in the management of American - companies.", "His own secretary of commerce had to be subpoenaed by the Congress to reveal the names of businesses who were subject to this boycott.", "They didn't volunteer the information.", "He had to be subpoenaed.", "And the last thing I'd like to say is this: This grain deal with the Soviet Union in '72 was terrible, and Mr. Ford made up for it with three embargoes, one against our own ally in Japan.", "That's not the way to run our foreign policy, including international trade.", " I would never single out food as a trade embargo item.", "If I ever decided to impose an embargo because of a crisis in international relationships, it would include all shipments of all equipment.", "For instance, if the Arab countries ever again declare an embargo against our nation on oil I would consider that not a military but an economic declaration of war, and I would respond instantly and in kind.", "I would not ship that Arab country anything - no weapons, no spare parts for weapons, no oil-drilling rigs, no oil pipe, no nothing.", "I wouldn't single out just food.", "Another thing that I'd like to say is this: In our international trade, as I said in my op- opening statement, we have become the arms merchant of the world.", "When this Republican administration came into office we were shipping about $1 billion worth of arms overseas, now ten to twelve billion dollars worth of arms overseas to countries that quite often use these weapons to fight each other.", "The shift in emphasis has been very disturbing to me, speaking about the Middle East.", "Under the last Democratic administration 60 percent of all weapons that went into the Middle East were for Israel.", "Nowadays - 75 percent were for Israel before.", "Now 60 percent go to the Arab countries, and this does not include Iran.", "If you include Iran, our present shipment of weapons to the Middle East, only 20 percent goes to Israel.", "This is a deviation from idealism; it's a deviation from a commitment to our major ally in the Middle East, which is Israel; it's a yielding to economic pressure on the part of the Arabs on the oil issue; and it's also a tremendous indication that under the Ford administration we have not addressed the energy policy adequately.", "We still have no comprehensive energy policy in this country.", "And it's an overall sign of weakness.", "When we are weak at home economically - high unemployment, high inflation, a confused government, a wasteful defense establishment, this encourages the kind of pressure that's been put on us successfully.", "It would've been inconceivable ten - fifteen years ago, for us to be brought to our knees with an Arab oil embargo.", "But it was done three years ago and they're still putting pressure on us from the Arab countries to our discredit around the world.", "These are the weaknesses that I see, and I believe it's not just a matter of idealism.", "It's a matter of being tough.", "It's a matter of being strong.", "It's a matter of being consistent.", "Our priorities ought to be first of all to meet our own military needs, secondly to meet the needs of our allies and friends, and only then should we ship military equipment to foreign countries.", "As a matter of fact, Iran is gonna get eighty F-14s before we even meet our own Air Force orders for F-l4s.", "And the shipment of Spruance-class destroyers to Iran are much more highly sophisticated than the Spruance-class destroyers that are present being delivered to our own Navy.", "This is ridiculous and it ought to be changed.", " If - Iran is not an Arab country, as you know, it is a Moslem country - but if Saudi Arabia should declare an oil embargo against us, then I would consider that an economic declaration of war.", "And I would make sure that the uh - Saudis understood this ahead of time so there would be no doubt in their mind.", "I think under those circumstances they would refrain from pushing us to our knees as they did in 1973 with their previous oil embargo.", " Governor Carter uh - apparently doesn't realize that since I've been president we have sold to the Israelis over $4 billion in military hardware.", "We have made available to the Israelis over 45 percent of the total economic and military aid since the establishment of Israel twenty-seven years ago.", "So the Ford administration has done a good job in helping our good ally, Israel, and we're dedicated to the survival and security of Israel.", "I believe that Governor Carter doesn't realize the need and necessity for arms sales to Iran.", "He indicates he would not make those.", "Iran is bordered very extensively by the Soviet Union.", "Iran has Iraq as one of its neighbors.", "The Soviet Union and the Communist-dominated government of Iraq are neighbors of Iran, and Iran is an ally of the United States.", "It's my strong feeling that we ought to sell arms to Iran for its own national security, and as an ally - a strong ally of the United States.", "The history of our relationship with Iran goes back to the days of President Truman when he decided that it was vitally necessary for our own security as well as that of Iran, that we should help that country, and Iran has been a good ally.", "In 1973 when there was an oil embargo, Iran did not participate.", "Iran continued to sell oil to the United States.", "I believe that it's in our interest and in the interest of Israel and Iran, and Saudi Arabia, for the United States to sell arms to those countries.", "It's for their security as well as ours.", " Our relationship with the People's Republic of China is based upon the Shanghai Communique, of 1972, and that communique, calls for the normalization of relations between the United States and the People's Republic.", "It doesn't set a times schedule.", "It doesn't uh - make a determination as to how uh - that relationship should be achieved in relationship to our current uhh - diplomatic recognition and obligations to the Taiwanese Government.", "The Shanghai Communique, does say that the differences between the People's Republic on the one hand and Taiwan on the other shall be settled by peaceful means.", "The net result is this administration, and during my time as the president for the next four years, we will continue to move for normalization of relations in the traditional sense, and we will insist that the disputes between Taiwan and the People's Republic be settled peacefully, as was agreed in the Shanghai Communique, of 1972.", "The Ford administration will not let down, will not eliminate or forget our obligation to the people of Taiwan.", "We feel that there must be a continued obligation to the people, the some nineteen or twenty million people in Taiwan.", "And as we move during the next four years, those will be the policies of this administration.", " There is no policy of this government to give to the People's Republic, or to sell to the People's Republic of China, military equipment.", "I do not believe that we, the United States, should sell, give or otherwise transfer military hardware to the People's Republic of China, or any other Communist nation, such as the Soviet Union and the like.", " Well, I'd like to go back just one moment to the previous question, where uh - Mr. Ford, I think, confused the issue by trying to say that we are shipping Israel 40 percent of our aid.", "As a matter of fact, during this current year uh we are shipping Iran, or have contracted to ship to Iran, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms and also to Saudi Arabia, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms.", "Also in 1975, we almost brought Israel to their knees after the uh - Yom Kippur War by the so-called reassessment of our relationship to Israel.", "We in effect tried to make Israel the scapegoat for the problems in the Middle East.", "And this weakened our relationships with Israel a great deal and put a cloud on the total commitment that our people feel toward the Israelis.", "There ought to be a clear, unequivocal commitment without change to Israel.", "In the Far East I think we need to continue to be uh - strong and uh - I would certainly uh - pursue the uh - normalization of uh - relationships with the People's Republic of China.", "We opened a great opportunity in l972, which has pretty well been frittered - frit- frittered away under Mr. Ford, that ought to be a constant uh - inclination toward - uh - toward friendship.", "But I would never let that friendship with the People's Republic of China stand in the way of the preservation of the independence and freedom of the people on Taiwan.", " Well, always in the past we've had an ability to have a strong defense and also have - to have a strong uh - domestic economy, and also to be strong in our reputation and influence within the community of nations.", "These uh - characteristics of our country have been endangered under Mr. Ford.", "We're no longer respected in a showdown vote in the United Nations or in - in any other international council we're lucky to get 20 percent of the other nations to vote with us.", "Our allies feel that we've neglected them.", "The so-called Nixon shock against Japan had weakened our relationships there.", "Under this administration we've also had an inclination to keep separate the European countries, thinking that if they are separate, then we can dominate them and proceed with our secret, Lone Ranger-type diplomatic efforts.", "I would uh - also like to point out that we, in this country, have let our economy go down the drain.", "The worst inflation since the Great Depression.", "The highest unemployment of any developed nation of the world.", "We have a higher unemployment rate in this country than Great Britain, and West Germany.", "Our unemployment rate is twice as high as it is in Italy; it's three or four times as high as it is - as it is in Japan.", "And that terrible circumstance in this country is exported overseas.", "We comprise about 30 percent of the world's economic trade power influence.", "And when we're weak at home - weaker than all our allies - that weakness weakens the whole free world.", "So strong economy is very important.", "Another thing that we need to do is to reestablish the good relationships that we ought to have between the United States and our natural allies and friends.", "They have felt neglected.", "And using that base of strength, and using the idealism, the honesty, the predictability, the commitment, the integrity of our own country, that's where our strength lies.", "And that would permit us to deal with the developing nations in a position of strength.", "Under this administration we've had a continuation of the so-called balance of power politics, where everything is looked on as a struggle between us on the one side, the Soviet Union on the other.", "Our allies - the smaller countries get trampled in the rush.", "What we need is to try to seek individualized bilateral relationships with countries, regardless of their size, and to establish world-order politics, which means that we want to preserve peace through strength.", "We also wanna revert back to the stature and the respect that our country had in previous administrations.", "Now, I can't say when this can come.", "But I can guarantee it will not come if Gerald Ford is reelected and this present policy is continued; it will come if I'm elected.", " Well let me say very quickly that under President Johnson, in spite of the massive investment in the Vietnam War, he turned over a balanced budget to Mr. Nixon.", "The unemployment rate was less than 4 percent.", "The inflation rate under Kennedy and Johnson was about 2 percent - one-third what it is under this administration.", "So we did have at that time with good management, the ability to do both.", "I don't think that anybody can say that Johnson and Kennedy neglected the poor and the destitute people in this country or around the world.", " The number one responsibility of any president, above all else, is to guarantee the security of our nation - an ability to be free of the threat of attack, or blackmail and to carry out our obligations to our allies and friends, and to carry out a legitimate foreign policy.", "They must go hand in hand, but the security of this nation has got to come first.", " Let me say very categorically you cannot maintain the security of the United States with the kind of defense budget cuts that Governor Carter has indicated.", "In 1975 he wanted to cut the budget $15 billion.", "He's now down to a figure of five to seven billion dollars.", "Reductions of that kind will not permit the United States to be strong enough to deter aggression and maintain the peace.", "Governor Carter apparently doesn't know the facts.", "As soon as I became president, I initiated a meeting with the NATO heads of state and met with them in Brussels to discuss how we could improve the re- defense relationship in Western Europe.", "In uh - November of 1975 I met with the leaders of the five industrial nations in France for the purpose of seeing what we could do acting together to meet the problems of uh - the coming recession.", "In Puerto Rico this year, I met with six of the leading industrial nations' heads of state to meet the problem of inflation so we would be able to solve it before it got out of hand.", "I have met with the heads of government bilaterally as well as multilaterally.", "Our relations with Japan have never been better.", "I was the first United States president to visit Japan.", "And we uh - had the emperor of Japan here this uh - past year and the net result is Japan and the United States are working more closely together now than at any time in the history of our relationship.", "You can go around the world - and let me take Israel for example.", "Just recently, President Rabin said that our relations were never better.", " First we have to understand that SALT I expires October third 1977.", "Uh - Mr. Brezhnev and I met in Vladivostok in December of 1974 for the purpose of trying to take the initial step so we could have a SALT II agreement that would go to l985.", "As I indicated earlier, we did agree on a twenty-four-hundred limitation on uh - uh - launchers of ballistic missiles.", "Uh - that would mean a cutback in the Soviet program; it would not interfere with our own program.", "At the same time, we put a limitation of thirteen hundred and twenty on MIRVs.", "Our technicians have been working since that time in Geneva, trying to put into technical language a - an agreement that can be verified by both parties.", "In the meantime, there has developed the problem of the Soviet Backfire - their high-performance aircraft which they say is not a long-range aircraft and which some of our people say is a intercontinental aircraft.", "In the interim, there has been the development on our part primarily, the cruise missiles; cruise missiles that could be launched from land-based mobile installations; cruise missiles that could be launched - launched from high-performance aircraft, like the B-52s or the B-1s, which I hope we proceed with; cruise missiles which could be launched from either surface or submarine uh - naval vessels.", "Those gray-area weapons systems are creating some problems in a - the agreement for a SALT II negotiation.", "But I can say that I am dedicated to proceeding, and I met just last week with the foreign minister of the Soviet Union, and he indicated to me that uh - the Soviet Union was interested in narrowing the differences and making a realistic and a sound compromise.", "I hope and trust, in the best interest of both countries, and in the best interests of all people throughout this globe, that the Soviet Union and the United States can make a mutually beneficial agreement.", "Because if we do not and SALT I expires on October three, 1977, you will unleash again an all-out nuclear arms race with the potential of a nuclear holocaust of unbelievable dimensions.", "So it's the obligation of the president to do just that, and I intend to do so.", " I believe that the cruise missiles which we are now developing in research and development across the spectrum from air, from the sea, or from the land, uh - can be uh - included within a SALT II agreement.", "They are a new weapons system that has a great potential, both conventional and nuclear armed.", "At the same time, we have to make certain that the Soviet Union's Backfire, which they claim is not an intercontinental aircraft and which some of our people contend is, must also be included if we are to get the kind of agreement which is in the best interest of both countries.", "And I really believe that it - it's far better for us and for the Soviet Union, and more importantly for the people around the world, that these two superpowers find an answer for a SALT II agreement before October three, 1977.", "I think good will on both parts, hard bargaining by both parties and a reasonable compromise will be in the best interests of all parties.", " Well, Mr. Ford acts like he's uh - running for president for the first time.", "He's been in office two years, and there has been absolutely no progress made toward a new SALT agreement.", "He has learned the date of the expiration of SALT I, apparently.", "We've seen, in this world, a development of a tremendous threat to us.", "As a nuclear engineer myself, I know the limitations and capabilities of atomic power.", "I also - know that as far as the human beings on this earth are concerned that the nonproliferation of atomic weapons is number one.", "Only the last few days with the election approaching, has Mr. Ford taken any interest in a nonproliferation movement.", "I advocated last May in a speech at the United Nations that we move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear devices, both weapons and peaceful devices; that we not ship any more atomic fuel to a country that refuses to comply with strict controls over the waste which can be reprocessed into explosives.", "I've also advocated that we stop the sale by Germany and France of - processing plants for Pakistan and Brazil.", "Mr. Ford hasn't moved on this.", "We also need to provide an adequate supply of enriched uranium.", "Mr. Ford, again, under pressure from the atomic energy lobby, has insisted that this reprocessing or rather re-en- enrichment be done by private industry and not by the existing uh - government uh - plants.", "This kind of confusion and absence of leadership has let us drift now for two years with a constantly increasing threat of atomic weapons throughout the world.", "We now have five nations that have atomic bombs that we know about.", "If we continue under Mr. Ford's policy by 1985 or '90 we'll have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons.", "This has got to be stopped.", "That is one of the major challenges and major undertakings that I will assume as the next president.", " No, it's not just campaign rhetoric.", "I think that militarily we are as strong as any nation on earth.", "I think we got to stay that way and continue to increase our capabilities to meet any potential threat.", "But as far as strength derived from commitment to principles, as far as strength derived from the unity within our country, as far as strength derived from the people, the Congress, the secretary of state, the president, sharing in the evolution and carrying-out of a foreign policy, as far as strength derived from the respect of our own allies and friends, their assurance that we will be staunch in our commitment, that we will not deviate and that we'll give them adequate attention, as far as - as strength derived from doing what's right - caring for the poor, providing food, becoming the breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world - in those respects, we're not strong.", "Also, we'll never be strong again overseas, unless we're strong at home.", "And with our economy in such terrible disarray and getting worse by the month.", "We've got five-hundred thousand more Americans unemployed today than we had three months ago.", "We've got two and a half million more Americans out of work now than we had when Mr. Ford took office.", "This kind of deterioration in our economic strength is bound to weaken us around the world.", "And we not only have uh problems at home but we export those problems overseas.", "So as far as the respect of our own people toward our own government, as far as participating in the shaping of uh - concepts and commitments, as far as the trust of our country among the nations of the world, as far as dependence of our country in meeting the needs and obligations that we've expressed to our allies, as far as the respect of our country - even among our potential adversaries - we are weak.", "Potentially we're strong.", "Under this administration that strength has not been realized.", " Governor Carter uh - brags about the unemployment during Democratic administrations and condemns the unemployment at the present time.", "I must remind him that we're at peace and during the period that he brags about unemployment being low, the United States was at war.", "Now let me correct one other comment that uh - Governor Carter has made.", "I have recommended to the Congress that we develop the uranium enrichment plant at Portsmouth, Ohio, which is a publicly owned - U.S. government facility and have indicated that the private program which would follow on in Alabama is one that may or may not uhh - be constructed.", "But I am committed to the one at Portsmouth, Ohio.", "The governor also talks about morality in foreign policy.", "The foreign policy of the United States meets the highest standards of morality.", "What is more moral than peace, and the United States is at peace today?", "What is more moral in foreign policy than for the administration to take the lead in the World Food Conference in Rome in 1974 when the United States committed six million metric tons of food - over 60 percent of the food committed for the disadvantaged and underdeveloped nations of the world?", "The Ford administration wants to eradicate hunger and disease in our underdeveloped countries throughout the world.", "What is more moral than for the United States under the Ford administration to take the lead in southern Africa, in the Middle East?", "Those are initiatives in foreign policy which are of the highest moral standard and that is indicative of the foreign policy of this country.", " I believe that uh - our foreign policy must express the highest standards of morality.", "And the initiatives that we took in southern Africa are the best examples of what this administration is doing and will continue to do in the next four years.", "If the United States had not moved when we did in southern Africa, there's no doubt there would have been an acceleration of bloodshed in that tragic part of the world.", "If we had not taken our initiative, it's very, very possible that uh - the government of Rhodesia would have been overrun and that the Soviet Union and the Cubans would have dominated uh - southern Africa.", "So the United States, seeking to preserve the principle of self-determination, to eliminate the possibility of bloodshed, to protect the rights of the minority as we insisted upon the rights of the majority, uh - I believe followed the good conscience of the American people in foreign policy.", "And I believe that we used our skill.", "Secretary of State Kissinger has done a superb job in working with the black African nations, the so-called front-line nations.", "He has done a superb job in getting the prime minister of South Africa, Mr. Vorster, to agree that the time had come for a solution to the problem of Rhodesia.", "Secretary Kissinger, in his meeting with uh - Prime Minister Smith of Rhodesia, was able to convince him that it was in the best interests of whites as well as blacks in Rhodesia to find an answer for a transitional government and then a majority government.", "This is a perfect example of the kind of leadership that the United States, under this administration, has taken.", "And I can assure you that this administration will follow that high moral principle in our future efforts in foreign policy, including our efforts in the Middle East where it is vitally important because the Middle East is the crossroads of the world.", "There've been more disputes in its area where there's more volatility than any other place in the world.", "But because Arab nations and the Israelis trust the United States, we were able to take the lead in the Sinai II Agreement.", "And I can assure you that the United States will have the leadership role in moving toward a comprehensive settlement of the Middle Eastern problems, I hope and trust as soon as possible.", "And we will do it with the highest moral principles.", " I would hope that as we move to one area of the world from another - and the United States must not spread itself too thinly - that was one of the problems that helped to create the circumstances in Vietnam - but as we as a nation find that we are asked by the various parties, either one nation against another or individuals within a nation, that the United States will take the leadership and try to resolve the differences.", "Let me take uh - South Korea as an example.", "I have personally told President Pack that the United States does not condone the kind of repressive measures that he has taken in that country.", "But I think in all fairness and equity we have to recognize the problem that South Korea has.", "On the north they have North Korea with five hundred thousand well-trained, well-equipped troops - they are supported by the People's Republic of China; they are supported by the Soviet Union.", "South Korea faces a very delicate situation.", "Now the United States, in this case, this administration, has recommended a year ago and we have reiterated it again this year, that the United States, South Korea, North Korea and the uh - People's Republic of China sit down at a conference table to resolve the problems of the Korean peninsula.", "This is a leadership role that the United States under this administration is carrying out, and if we do it, and I think the opportunities and the possibilities are getting better, we will have solved many of the internal domestic problems that exist in South Korea at the present time.", " I notice that Mr. Ford didn't comment on the uh - prisons in Chile.", "This is an - a typical example, maybe of many others, where this administration overthrew an elected government and helped to establish a military dictatorship.", "This has not been an ancient history story.", "Last year under Mr. Ford, of all the Food for Peace that went to South America, 85 percent went to the military dictatorship in Chile.", "Another point I wanna make is this.", "He says we have to move from one area of the world to another.", "That's one of the problems with this administration's so-called shuttle diplomacy.", "While the secretary of state's in one country, there are almost a hundred and fifty others that are wondering what we're gonna do next, what will be the next secret agreement.", "We don't have a comprehensive understandable foreign policy that deals with world problems or even regional problems.", "Another thing that concerned me was what Mr. Ford said about unemployment, that - insinuating that under Johnson and Kennedy that unemployment could only be held down when this country is at war.", "Karl Marx said that the free enterprise system in a democracy can only continue to exist when they are at war or preparing far war.", "Karl Marx was the grandfather of Communism.", "I don't agree with that statement.", "I hope Mr. Ford doesn't either.", "He has put pressure on the Congress - and I don't believe Mr. Ford would even deny this - to hold up on nonproliferation legislation until the Congress agreed for an $8 billion program for private industry to start producing enriched uranium.", "And the last thing I wanna make is this.", "He talks about peace and I'm thankful for peace.", "We were peaceful when Mr. Ford went into office.", "But he and Mr. Kissinger and others tried to start a new Vietnam in Angola, and it was only the outcry of the American people and the Congress when their secret deal was discovered that prevented our involvement in that conflagration which was taking place there.", " Well, here again, uh - the Panamanian question is one that's been confused by Mr. Ford.", "Uh - he had directed his uh - diplomatic relation - uh - uh - representative to yield to the Panamanians full sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone at the end of a certain period of time.", "When Mr. Reagan raised this uh - question in Florida uh - Mr. Ford not only disavowed his instructions, but he also even dropped, parenthetically, the use of the word \"detente.\"", "I would never give up complete control or practical control of the Panama Canal Zone, but I would continue to negotiate with the Panamanians.", "When the original treaty was signed back in the early 1900s, when Theodore Roosevelt was president, Panama retained sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone.", "We retained control as though we had sovereignty.", "Now I would be willing to go ahead with negotiations.", "I believe that we could share more fully responsibilities for the Panama Canal Zone with Panama.", "I would be willing to continue to raise the payment for shipment of goods through the Panama Canal Zone.", "I might even be willing to reduce to some degree our military emplacements in the Panama Canal Zane, but I would not relinquish practical control of the Panama Canal Zane any time in the foreseeable future.", " The United States must and will maintain complete access to the Panama Canal.", "The United States must maintain a defense capability of the Panama Canal.", "And the United States will maintain our national security interest in the Panama Canal.", "The negotiations far the Panama Canal started under President Johnson and have continued up to the present time.", "I believe those negotiations should continue.", "But there are certain guidelines that must be followed, and I've just defined them.", "Let me take just a minute to comment on something that Governor Carter said.", "On non - nu- oh - uh - nonproliferation, in May of l975, I called for a conference of uh - nuclear suppliers.", "That conference has met six times.", "In May of this year, Governor Carter took the first initiative, approximately twelve months after I had taken my initiative a year ago.", " The White House did not uh - prevent the release of that report.", "On July twelfth of this year, we gave full permission for the release of that report.", "I was very disappointed in the fact that the uh - GAO released that report because I think it interjected political partisan politics at the present time.", "But let me comment on the report.", "Somebody who sits in Washington, D.C., eighteen months after the Mayaguez incident, can be a very good grandstand quarterback.", "And let me make another observation.", "This morning, I got a call from the skipper of the Mayaguez.", "He was furious because he told me that it was the action of me, President Ford, that saved the lives of the crew of the Mayaguez.", "And I can assure you that if we had not taken the strong and forceful action that we did, we would have been uh - criticized very, very uh - severely for sitting back and not moving.", "Captain Miller is thankful.", "The crew is thankful.", "We did the right thing.", "It seems to me that those who sit in Washington eighteen months after the incident are not the best judges of the decision-making process that had to be made by the National Security Council and by myself at the time the incident was developing in the Pacific.", "Let me assure you that we made every possible overture to the People's Republic of China and through them to the Cambodian Government.", "We made uh - diplomatic uh - protests to the Cambodian government through the United Nations.", "Every possible diplomatic means was utilized.", "But at the same time, I had a responsibility, and so did the National Security Coun- Council, to meet the problem at hand.", "And we handled it responsibly and I think Captain Miller's testimony to that effect is the best evidence.", " Well, I'm reluctant to uh comment on the recent report - I haven't read it.", "I think the American people have only one - uh requirement - that the facts about Mayaguez be given to them accurately and completely.", "Mr. Ford has been there for eighteen months.", "He had the facts that were released today immediately after the Mayaguez incident.", "I understand that the report today is accurate.", "Mr. Ford has said, I believe, that it was accurate, and that the White House made no attempt to block the issuing of that report.", "I don't know if that's exactly accurate or not.", "I understand that both the - the uh - Department of State and the Defense Department have approved the accuracy of today's report, or yesterday's report, and also the National Security Agency.", "I don't know what was right, or what was wrong, or what was done.", "The only thing I believe is that whatever the - the knowledge was that Mr. Ford had should have been given to the American people eighteen months ago, immediately after the Mayaguez uh - incident occurred.", "This is uh - what the American people want.", "When something happens that endangers our security, or when something happens that threatens our stature in the world, or when American people are endangered by the actions of a foreign country, uh - just forty uh sailors on the Mayaguez, we obviously have to move aggressively and quickly to rescue them.", "But then after the immediate action is taken, I believe the president has an obligation to tell the American people the truth and not wait eighteen months later for the report to be issued.", " I believe that the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries because those businesses trade with Israel or because they have American Jews who are owners or directors in the company is an absolute disgrace.", "This is the first time that I've - remember in the history of our country when we've let a foreign country circumvent or change our Bill of Rights.", "I'll do everything I can as president to stop the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries.", "It's not a matter of diplomacy or trade with me.", "It's a matter of morality.", "And I don't believe that Arab countries will pursue it when we have a strong president who will protect the integrity of our country, the commitment of our Constitution and Bill of Rights and protect people in this country who happen to be Jews.", "It may later be Catholics; it may be - later be Baptists who are threatened by some foreign country.", "But we ought to stand staunch.", "And I think it's a disgrace that so far Mr. Ford's administration has blocked the passage of legislation that would've revealed by law every instance of the boycott and it would've prevented the boycott from continuing.", " Again Governor Carter is inaccurate.", "The Arab boycott action was first taken in 1952.", "And in November of 1975 I was the first president to order the executive branch to take action, affirmative action, through the Department of Commerce and other cabinet departments, to make certain that no American businessman or business organization should discriminate against Jews because of an Arab boycott.", "And I might add that uh - my administration - and I'm very proud of it - is the first administration that has taken an antitrust action against companies in this country that have allegedly cooperated with the Arab boycott.", "Just on Monday of this week I signed a tax bill that included an amendment that would prevent companies in the United States from taking a tax deduction if they have in any way whatsoever cooperated with the Arab boycott.", "And last week when we were trying to get the Export Administration Act through the Congress - necessary legislation - my administration went to Capitol Hill and tried to convince the House and the Senate that we should have an amendment on that legislation which would take strong and effective action against those who uh - participate or cooperate with the Arab uh boycott.", "One other point.", "Because the Congress failed to act, I am going to announce tomorrow that the Department of Commerce will disclose those companies that have uh - participated in the Arab boycott.", "This is something that we can do; the Congress failed to do it, and we intend to do it.", " Let me restate uh - our policy.", "As long as Vietnam, North Vietnam, does not give us a full and complete accounting of our missing in action, I will never uh - go along with the admission of Vietnam to the United Nations.", "If they do give us a bona fide, complete uh - accounting of the eight hundred MIA's, then I believe that the United States should begin negotiations for the uh - admission of Vietnam to the United Nations.", "But not until they have given us the full accounting of our MIAs.", " One of the uh - most embarrassing uh - failures of the Ford administration, and one that touches specifically on human rights, is his refusal to appoint a presidential commission to go to Vietnam, to go to Laos, to go to Cambodia and try to trade for the release of information about those who are missing in action in those wars.", "This is what the families of MIAs want.", "So far, Mr. Ford has not done it.", "We've had several fragmentary efforts by members of the Congress and by - by private citizens.", "Several months ago the Vietnam government said, \"We are ready to sit down and negotiate for release of information on MIAs.", "So far, Mr. Ford has not responded.", "I would never normalize relationships with Vietnam, nor permit them to join the United Nations until they've taken this action.", "But that's not enough.", "We need to have an active and aggressive action on the part of the president, the leader of his country, to seek out every possible way to get that information which has kept the MIA families in despair and doubt, and Mr. Ford has just not done it.", " The purpose of this debate and the outcome of the election will determine three basic things: Leadership, upholding the principles of our country, and proper priorities and commitments for the future.", "This election will also determine what kind of world we leave our children.", "Will it be a nightmare world threatened with the proliferation of atomic bombs, not just in five major countries but dozens of smaller countries that have been permitted to develop atomic weapons because of a failure of our top leadership to stop proliferation?", "Will we have a world of hunger and - and hatred, and will we be living in an armed camp stripped of our friendship and allies hiding behind a tight defense that's been drawn in around us because we are fearful of the outside world?", "Will we have a government of secrecy that excludes the American people from participation in making basic decisions and therefore covers up mistakes and makes it possible for our government - our government - to depart from the principles of our Constitution and Bill of Rights?", "Or will we have a world of peace with the threat of atomic weapons eliminated, with full trade, with our people at work, inflation controlled, openness in government, our people proud once again, Congress, citizens, president, secretary of state working in harmony and unity toward a common future?", "Or world where people have enough to eat and a world where we care about those who don't?", "Can we become a breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world?", "I believe we can and we ought to.", "Now we've been hurt in recent years in this country.", "In the aftermath of Vietnam, Cambodia, Chile, Pakistan, Angola, Watergate, CIA, we've been hurt.", "Our people feel that we've lost something precious.", "That's not necessary.", "I wanna see our nation - return to a posture and an image and a standard to make us proud once again.", "I remember the world with NATO, and the world of Point Four, and the world of the Marshall Plan, and the world of the Peace Corps.", "Why can't we have that once again?", "We ought to be a beacon for nations who search for peace and who search for freedom, who search for individual liberty, who search for basic human rights.", "We haven't been lately.", "We can be once again.", "We'll never have that world leadership until we are strong at home, and we can have that strength if we return to the basic principles.", "It ought not to be a strength of bombast and threats.", "It ought to be a quiet strength based on the integrity of our people, the vision of the Constitution, an in- innate strong will and purpose that God's given us in the greatest nation on earth - the United States.", " As we have seen tonight, foreign policy and defense policy are difficult and complex issues.", "We can debate methods, we can debate one decision or another, but there are two uh things which cannot be debated - experience and results.", "In the last two years, I have made policy decisions involving - long-range difficulties and policies and made day-to-day judgments not only as president of the United States but as the leader of the free world What is the result of that leadership?", "America is strong.", "America is free.", "America is respected.", "Not a single young American today is fighting or dying on any foreign battlefield.", "America is at peace and with freedom.", "Thank you, and good night.", " The question goes to whether I am qualified to be Vice President, and in the case of a tragedy, whether I'm qualified to be President.", "Qualifications for the office of Vice President or President are not age alone.", "You must look at accomplishments, and you must look at experience.", "I have more experience than others that have sought the office of Vice President.", "Now let's look at qualifications, and let's look at the three biggest issues that are going to be confronting America in the next presidency.", "Those three issues are national security and arms control; jobs and education; and the Federal budget deficit.", "On each one of those issues I have more experience than does the Governor of Massachusetts.", "In national security and arms control, you have to understand the difference between a ballistic missile, a warhead, what throwweight, what megatonnage is.", "You better understand about telemetry and encryption.", "And you better understand that you have to negotiate from a position of strength.", "These are important issues, because we want to have more arms control and arms reductions.", "In the area of jobs and education, I wrote the Job Training Partnership Act, a bipartisan bill, a bill that has trained and employed over three million economically disadvantaged youth and adults in this country.", "On the area of the Federal budget deficit, I have worked eight years on the Senate Budget Committee.", "And I wish that the Congress would give us the line item veto to help deal with that.", "And if qualifications alone are going to be the issue in this campaign, George Bush has more qualifications than Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen combined.", "(Applause)", " This debate tonight is not about the qualifications for the Vice Presidency.", "The debate is whether or not Dan Quayle and Lloyd Bentsen are qualified to be President of the United States.", "Because Judy, just as you have said, that has happened too often in the past.", "And if that tragedy should occur, we have to step in there without any margin for error, without time for preparation, to take over the responsibility for the biggest job in the world, that of running this great country of ours; to take over the awesome responsibility for commanding the nuclear weaponry that this country has.", "No, the debate tonight is a debate about the presidency itself, and a presidential decision that has to be made by you.", "The stakes could not be higher.", " Well, I am delighted to respond to that question, because we agree on so many things and the vast majority of the issues.", "We agree on the fact that we have to cut this deficit.", "And Gov.", "Dukakis has been able to cut that deficit ten budgets in a row in the State of Massachusetts, while he lowered the tax burden on their people from one of the highest to one of the lower in the United States.", "That is a major sense of achievement.", "And I admire that.", "And I'm just delighted to be on the ticket with him.", "Gov.", "Dukakis and I agreed that we ought to have a trade policy for this country; that we've seen this Administration more than double the national debt, that; they've moved this country from the number one lender nation in the world to the number one debtor nation in the world under their Administration; that they have not had a trade policy; that they have let trade be a handmaiden for their foreign policy objectives of the country; that this country has exported too many jobs and not enough products.", "And as I worked to pass a trade bill through the United States Senate, they threw roadblocks in the way every step of the way.", "But we passed a trade bill that has this premise, that any country that has full access to our markets, we're entitled to full access to their markets.", "Now, that means that we're going to stand tough for America, and we're going to protect those jobs, and we're going to push American products, and we're going to open up markets around the world.", "We'll show leadership in that respect, and turn this deficit and trade around.", "That's the sort of thing that Michael Dukakis and I will do to bring about a better America for all our people.", " As you notice, Senator Bentsen didn't tell you very much about what Gov.", "Dukakis would do - Gov.", "Dukakis, one of the most liberal governors in the United States of America The one thing he tried to point out about Gov.", "Dukakis is that he's cut taxes.", "The fact of the matter is, Senator Bentsen, he's raised taxes five times.", "He just raised taxes this past year.", "And that's why a lot of people refer to him as Tax-hike Mike.", "That's why they refer to the State of Massachusetts as Taxachusetts.", "Because every time there's a problem, the liberal governor from Massachusetts raises taxes.", "I don't blame Senator Bentsen for not talking about Gov.", "Michael Dukakis.", "He's talking more about his record.", "If I had to defend the liberal policies of Gov.", "Michael Dukakis, I wouldn't talk about it either.", " Well, I must say I hate to disappoint my good friend Bob Strauss, but we have a contract with the American people on Social Security.", "And Social Security is an issue where Senator Quayle voted eight times to cut the benefits on Social Security, where this administration came in and tried to cut the benefits, the minimum benefits, $122 a month for widows, for retirees, tried to cut the benefits for 62-year-old retirees by 40 percent, tried to do an end run on Social Security when they first came in after promising not to cut it - to cut it by some 20 billion, and while we were working together to reform the Social Security system and to be certain that that money was going to be there for people when they retired.", "At that point they tried a $40-billion end run to cut Social Security.", "Now, the record is clear.", "And we saw Vice President Bush fly back from the west coast to break a tie in the United States Senate.", "He doesn't get to vote very often in the Senate, but he made a special trip to come back and vote against a cost-of-living increase.", "Now, when you talk about Social Security, the people that are going to protect it are the Democrats that brought forth that program.", "And I think it's very important that we not see these kinds of end runs by this administration.", "When they talk about the fact that they are going to continue to cut this budget, I know too well what their rack record is.", "And we should be concerned with that kind of an effort once again after the election is over.", " Senator Bentsen, you know that I did not vote to cut Social Security benefits eight times.", "What I have voted for and what Senator Bentsen has voted for is to delay the cost-of-living adjustments.", "Senator Bentsen two times in the United States Senate voted to delay the cost-of-living adjustments.", "The governor of Massachusetts at a governors' conference supported a resolution to delay the cost-of-living adjustment.", "And, John, you are right: they use this for political advantage.", "What they try to do time and time again is to scare the old people of this country.", "That's the politics of the past.", "In 1983 Republicans and Democrats dropped their political swords and in a bipartisan effort saved the Social Security system.", "Republicans and Democrats banded together because we know that this program is not a Republican program, it's not a Democrat program - it's a program for older Americans.", "And that program is actuarially sound to the turn of this century.", " I have a very strong record on the environment in the United States Senate.", "(Laughter) I have a record where I voted for the superfund legislation.", "I have a record where I voted against my president on the override of the Clean Water Act.", "I have voted for the major pieces of environmental legislation that have come down and been voted on in the United States Senate.", "This administration - and I support this administration and its environmental efforts - has moved in the area for the first time to deal with the ozone problem.", "We now have an international treaty, the treaty that is commonly referred to as the Montreal Treaty.", "For the first time we are talking about the impact of CO2 to the ozone layer.", "That's progress with the environment.", "We are committed to the environment.", "I take my children hiking and fishing, walking in the woods, in the wilderness.", "Believe me, we have a commit to preserving the environment.", "You bring up the environment, you can't help but think about the environmental policy of the governor of Massachusetts.", "He talks about being an environmentalist.", "Let me tell you about his environmental policy.", "The Boston Harbor - the Boston Harbor, which is the dirtiest waterway in America, tons of raw sewage go in there each and every day.", "What has the governor of Massachusetts done about that?", "Virtually nothing.", "And then he has the audacity to go down to New Jersey and tell the people of New Jersey that he's against ocean dumping.", "This is the same governor that applied for a license to dump Massachusetts sewage waste off the coast of New Jersey.", "Who has the environmental record?", "Who has the environmental interest?", "George Bush and I do.", " This late conversion is interesting to me.", "(Laughter and applause) I must say, when they talk about Boston Harbor and he says he hasn't done anything, the facts are he has a $6-billion program under way on waste treatment.", "And it was this administration, their administration, that cut out the money early on to be able to clean up water, and made it impossible to move ahead at that time on Boston Harbor.", "We are the authors, the Democratic Party, of Clean Air, of Clean Water, of the superfund.", "I am one who played a very major role in passing the superfund legislation.", "And every environmental organization that I know, every major one, has now endorsed the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket.", "And I am one who has just received the environmental award in Texas for the work I've done to clean up the bays, to clean up the water, off the coast of Texas.", "No, I think we know well who's going to help clean up this environment.", "The record is there, the history is there.", "And Dukakis and Bentsen will be committed to that.", "(Applause)", " I have met with those people, and I met with them in Fort Wayne, Indiana, at a food bank.", "You may be surprised, Tom, they didn't ask me those questions on those votes, because they were glad that I took time out of my schedule to go down and to talk about how we are going to get a food bank going and making sure that a food bank goes in Fort Wayne, Indiana.", "And I have a very good record and a commitment to the poor, to those that don't have a family, that want to have a family.", "This administration, and a George Bush administration, will be committed to eradicating poverty.", "Poverty hasn't gone up in this administration; it hasn't gone down much either, and that means we have a challenge ahead of us.", "But let me tell you something, what we have done for the poor.", "What we have done for the poor is that we in fact - the homeless bill, the McKinney Act, which is the major piece of legislation that deals with homeless - the Congress has cut the funding that the administration has recommended.", "The poor and the poverty - the biggest thing that we have done for poverty in America is the Tax Simplification Act of 1986: six million working poor families got off the payroll; six million people are off the taxpaying payrolls because of that tax reform, and they are keeping the tax money there.", "To help the poor, we'll have a commitment to the programs and those programs will go on.", "And we are spending more in poverty programs today than we were in 1981 - that is a fact.", "The poverty program we are going to concentrate on is creating jobs and opportunities, so that everyone will have the opportunities that they want.]", "(Scattered applause)", " I find that very interesting, because he has been of no help at all when it comes to passing the most major welfare reform bill in the history of our country, one where we are working very hard to see that people can get off welfare, break that cycle, take a step up in life, doing the kinds of things that we did there to let them have Medicaid for a year.", "That's a positive thing that's done.", "What also frustrates me with the kind of report that I have just heard here is the kind of votes that he has cast against child nutrition programs, the fact that he has voted against money that we needed for further immunization, the denial of polio shots to kids where the parents couldn't afford to get that kind of a shot.", "Now, I don't really believe that that is identifying with the concerns of people in poverty.", " Gov.", "Dukakis and I have disagreed on the contra program; no question about that.", "But my big difference with this Administration is, they look at the contra aid program as the only way to resolve that problem.", "They concentrate on that.", "And I really think we have to give peace a chance.", "And that's why I have been a strong supporter of the Arias plan, a plan that won the Nobel Prize for President Arias, the President of Costa Rica.", "I believe you have to work with the leaders of those other Central American countries to try to bring about the democratization of Nicaragua - by negotiation, by pressure, by counseling, by diplomatic pressure, that we ought to be trying that first.", "But in concentrating so much just on the Contras, this Administration has not paid enough attention to the rest of Central America.", "The concern I have is that we have a country with 85 million people sharing a 2,000mile border with us, with half of those people under the age of 15, a country that's had its standard of living cut 50 percent in the last six years.", "Now we ought to be concerned about that, and we ought to be involved.", "I was born and reared on that Mexican border.", "I speak their language.", "I've spent a good part of my life down there.", "Gov.", "Dukakis speaks Spanish, too.", "He's spent a good deal of time in Central and South America.", "And we believe that we ought to be working with a new Alliance for Progress, bringing in other countries to help; bring in Europeans, the Spanish, who have a real affinity for that area; bringing in the Japanese who have a great surplus now and looking for places to invest it.", "Those are the positive things I think we could do to bring about peace in that area, to help raise that standard of living and give them the kind of stability where democracy can proceed and can prosper and bloom.", "Those are the kinds of things that we'd be committed to in a Dukakis-Bentsen Administration to try to make this world a better place in which to live.", " There's no doubt in a Dukakis Administration that the aid would be cut off to the democratic resistance in Nicaragua, and that is unfortunate.", "The reason it is unfortunate, because it is beyond me why it's okay for the Soviet Union to put in billions of dollars to prop up the communist Sandinistas, but somehow it's wrong for the United States to give a few dollars to the democratic resistance.", "There's a thing called the Monroe Doctrine, something that the Governor of Massachusetts has said has been superseded.", "I doubt if many Americans agree with that.", "I think they believe in the Monroe Doctrine.", "Senator Bentsen talked about the entire Central America.", "There's another issue that Michael Dukakis is wrong on in Central America, and that's Grenada.", "He criticized our rescue mission in Grenada, according to a UPI report.", "Criticized that, yet 85 percent of the American people supported our rescue mission, and we turned a communist country into a noncommunist country.", "The Governor of Massachusetts is simply out of step with mainstream America.", " No, I don't find it embarrassing at all.", "Because you have to remember that PAC money is the result of the last campaign reform bill, one that talks about employees have greater participation.", "And what I've done in PAC money is just what my opponent in my campaign has done in his campaign.", "He has been raising PAC money, too.", "So what you have to do is comply with the laws as they are, whether you're paying taxes or you're playing a football game.", "Whether you like those laws or not, you comply with them.", "Now, I have been for campaign reform, and have pushed it very hard.", "I believe that we have to do some things in that regard.", "But I've noticed that the Senator from Indiana has opposed that campaign reform and voted repeatedly against it.", "The things we have to do, I believe, that will cut back on soft money, for example, which I look on as frankly one of those things that we've had to do because the Republicans have done it for so long.", "But I think it's a loophole, frankly.", "But campaign reform, changing the rules of the game, is something we tried repeatedly in this session of the Congress, but only to have the Republicans lead the charge against us and defeat us.", "And I wish that Senator Quayle would change his mind on that particular piece of legislation and give us the kind of a campaign reform law that I think is needed in America.", " Senator Bentsen is the number one PAC raiser.", "As a matter of fact, he used to have a $10,000 breakfast club.", "$10,000 breakfast club.", "It only costs high paid lobbyists, special interests in Washington, to come down and have breakfast with the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the one that oversees all the tax loopholes in the tax code, $10,000.", "I'm sure they weren't paying to have cornflakes.", "Well, I'll tell you the kind of campaign reform I'm supporting, Senator Bentsen.", "I think it's time we get rid of PAC money.", "Support our legislation where we totally eliminate contributions by special interests and political action committees, and let's have the individual contribute and the political parties contribute.", "That's the kind of campaign reform that Republicans are for.", "They want to get rid of this special interest and rely on the individuals, and also, the political parties.", " First - first, I'd say a prayer for myself and for the country that I'm about to lead.", "And then I would assemble his people and talk.", "And I think this question keeps going back to the qualifications and what kind of Vice President in this hypothetical situation, if I had to assume the responsibilities of President, what I would be.", "And as I have said, age alone, although I can tell you, after the experiences of these last few week in the campaign, I've added ten years to my age, age alone is not the only qualification.", "You've got to look at experience, and you've got to look at accomplishments, and can you make a difference.", "Have I made a difference in the United States Senate where I've served for eight years?", "Yes, I have.", "Have I made a difference in the Congress that I've served for 12 years?", "Yes, I have.", "As I said before, looking at the issue of qualifications - and I am delighted that it comes up, because on the three most important challenges facing America, arms control and national security, jobs and education and budget deficit, I have more experience and accomplishments than does the Governor of Massachusetts.", "I have been in the Congress and I've worked on these issues.", "And believe me, when you look at arms control and trying to deal with the Soviet Union, you cannot come at it from a naive position.", "You have to understand the Soviet Union.", "You have to understand how they will respond.", "Sitting on that Senate Armed Services Committee for eight years has given me the experience to deal with the Soviet Union and how we can move forward.", "That is just one of the troubling issues that's going to be facing this nation, and I'm prepared.", " Well, I can't leave something on the table that he's charged me with, and so let's get to that one.", "When you talk about the breakfast club, as you know, that was perfectly legal.", "And I formed it, and I closed it down almost immediately because I thought the perception was bad.", "But it's the same law - it's the same law - that lets you invite high priced lobbyists down to Williamsburg.", "And bring them down there and entertain them playing golf, playing tennis, and bringing Republican Senators down there, to have exchanged for that contributions to their campaign.", "It's the same kind of law that lets you have honorariums - and you've collected over a quarter of a million dollars of honorariums now, speaking to various interest groups.", "And there's no control over what you do with that money.", "You can spend it on anything you want to.", "You can spent it on golf club dues, if you want to do that.", "(Applause)", " Now, that's what I've seen you do in this Administration.", "And that's why we need campaign reform laws, and why I support them.", "And you in turn have voted against them time and time again.", "(Applause)", " The premise of your question, John, is that somehow this administration has been lax in enforcement of the OSHA regulations.", "And I disagree with that.", "And I'll tell you why.", "If you want to ask some business people that I talk to periodically, they complain about the tough enforcement of this administration and, furthermore, let me tell you this for the record, when we have found violations in this administration, there has not only been tough enforcement, but there have been the most severe penalties - the largest penalties in the history of the Department of Labor - have been levied when these violations have been found.", "There is a commitment and there will always be a commitment to the safety of our working men and women.", "They deserve it and we're committed to them.", "Now, the broader question goes to the whole issue of deregulation and has deregulation worked or has deregulation not worked.", "In my judgment deregulation has worked.", "We have a deregulated economy and we have produced through low taxes, not high taxes, through deregulation - the spirit of entrepreneurship, the individual going out and starting a business, the businessman or women willing to go out and risk their investments to start up a business and hire people.", "We have produced 17 million jobs in this country since 1982.", "Deregulation as a form of political philosophy is a good philosophy.", "It's one that our opponents disagree with.", "They want a centralized government.", "But we believe in the market, we believe in the people and yes, there's a role of government and the role of government is to make sure that those safety - and health and the welfare of the people is taken care of.", "And we'll continue to do that.", " Well, I think you see once again a piece of Democratic legislation that's been passed to try protect the working men and women of America.", "And then you've seen an administration that came in and really didn't have it's heart in that kind of an enforcement.", "A good example of that is the environmental protection laws that we were talking about a moment ago.", "This administration came in and put in a James Watt, an Ann Gorsuch, now that's the Bonnie and Clyde, really, of environmental protection.", "And that's why it's important that you have people that truly believe and trying to represent the working men and women of America.", "Most employers do a good job of that, but some of them put their profits before people and that's why you have to have OSHA and that's why you have to have tough and good and fair enforcement of it and that's what a Democratic administration would do to help make this working place a safer and better place to be employed.", " Well, I've supported that.", "I voted for the 50,000 limitation to get away from the million dollar contributions to farmer.", "You know, of the four that are on this ticket, I'm the only on that was born and reared on a farm and still involved in farming, so I think I understand their concerns and their problems.", "Now, I feel very strongly that we ought to be doing more for the American farmer and what we've seen under this administration is neglect of that farmer.", "We've seen them drive 220,000 farmers off the farm.", "They seem to think the answer is move them to town, but we ought not to be doing that.", "What you have seen them do is cut the farm assistance for the rural areas by over 50 percent.", "We're seeing rural hospitals close all over the country because of this kind of an administration.", "We've seen an administration that has lost much of our market abroad, because they have not had a trade policy.", "We saw our market loss by some 40 percent.", "And that's one of the reasons that we've seen the cost of the farm program, which was only about two and a half billion dollars when they took office, now go to about $25 billion.", "Now, we can bring that kind of a cost down and get more to market prices if we'll have a good trade policy.", "I was in January visiting with Mr. Takeshita, the new Prime Minister of Japan.", "I said, \"You're paying five times as much for beef as we pay for our in country - pay for it in our country, six times as much for rice.", "You have a $60 billion trade surplus with us.", "You could improve the standard of living of your people.", "You're spending 27 percent of your disposable income.", "We spend 14 or 15 percent.\"", "\"When you have that kind of barrier up against us, that's not free and fair trade and we don't believe that should continue.\"", "We would be pushing very hard to open up those markets and stand up for the American farmer and see that we recapture those foreign markets and I think we can do it with the Dukakis-Bentsen administration.", " Senator Bentsen talks about recapturing the foreign markets.", "Well, I'll tell you one way that we're not going to recapture the foreign markets and that is if, in fact, we have another Jimmy Carter grain embargo.", "(Equal amounts of cheering and booing) Jimmy Carter - Jimmy Carter grain embargo set the American farmer back.", "You know what the farmer's interested in?", "Net farm income.", "Every one percent in increase in interest rates, a billion dollars out of the farmer's pocket.", "Net farm income, increased inflation, another billion dollars.", "Another thing that a farmer is not interested in and that's supply management that the Democratic platform talks about.", "But the Governor of Massachusetts, he has a farm program.", "He went to the farmers in the Midwest and told them not to grow corn, not to grow soybeans, but to grow Belgium [sic] endive.", "That's what his - that's what he and his Harvard buddies think of the American farmer, grow Belgium endive.", "To come in and to tell our farmers not to grow corn, not to grow soybeans, that's the kind of farm policy you'll get under a Dukakis administration and one I think the American farmer rightfully will reject.", " You know, if you let me write $200 billion worth of hot checks every year, I could give you an illusion of prosperity, too.", "(Laughter and applause) This is an administration that has more than doubled the national debt, and they've done that in less than eight years.", "They have taken this country from the No.", "1 lender nation in the world to the No.", "1 debtor nation in the world.", "And the interest on that debt next year, on this Reagan-Bush debt of our nation, is going to be $640 for every man, woman, and child in America because of this kind of a credit-card mentality.", "So we go out and we try to sell our securities every week, and hope that the foreigners will buy them.", "And they do buy them.", "But every time they do, we lose some of our economic independence for the future.", "Now they've turned around and they've bought 10 percent of the manufacturing base of this country.", "They bought 20 percent of the banks.", "They own 46 percent of the commercial real estate in Los Angeles.", "They are buying America on the cheap.", "Now, when we have other countries that can't manage their economy down in Central and South America, we send down the American ambassador, we send down the International Monetary Fund, and we tell them what they can buy and what they can sell and how to run their economies.", "The ultimate irony would be to have that happen to us, because foreigners finally quit buying our securities.", "So what we need in this country is someone like Mike Dukakis, who gave ten balanced budgets in a row there, and was able to do that, meet that kind of a commitment, set those tough priorities.", "We need an administration that will turn this trade policy around and open up those markets, stand tough with our trading partners to help keep the jobs at home and send the products abroad.", " Senator Bentsen talks about running up the debt.", "Well, the governor of Massachusetts has run up more debt than all the governors in the history of Massachusetts combined, going back to the days of the Pilgrims.", "I don't believe that that's the kind of policy that we want.", "The question went to the heart of the matter, Tom.", "You asked the question why would we change.", "Well, we have changed since 1980.", "We've got interest rates down, we've got inflation down, people are working again, America is held in respect once again around the world.", "But we are going to build on that change.", "And as we made those positive changes of lower interest rates, lower rate of inflation, the governor of Massachusetts fought us every step of the way.", "We are proud of the record of accomplishment and the opportunities and the hope for millions of Americans.", "Hope and opportunity of these Americans is because of the policies that we have had for the last eight years, and we want to build on that and change it for even the better.", " You are absolutely right that the drug problem is the No.", "1 issue.", " I will address the military aspect, if I may respond.", "The military aspect of the drug problem is being addressed.", "As a matter of fact, we are using the Department of Defense in a coordinated effort, in reconnaissance.", "But I don't believe that we are going to turn the Department of Defense into a police organization.", "We are using our military assets in a prudent way to deal with interdiction, and we've made some success in this area.", "Seventy tons of cocaine have been stopped.", "But, you know, when you look at the drug problem - and it is a tremendous problem, and there are no easy solutions to it - it's a complicated problem, and it's heading up the effort to try to create a drug-free America, which is a challenge and a goal of all of us.", "Not only will we utilize national defense and the Department of Defense, but we've got to get on the demand side of the ledger; we've got to get to education.", "And education ought to begin at home, and it ought to be reinforced in our schools.", "And there's another thing that will be more important than the premise of this question on a hypothetical of using troops.", "We will use the military assets, we will use military assets - but we need to focus on another part of this problem, and that problem is law enforcement.", "And here is where we have a major disagreement with the governor of Massachusetts.", "He is opposed to the death penalty for drug kingpins.", "We believe people convicted of that crime deserve the death penalty, as does the legislation that's in the Congress that is supported by a bipartisan, including many Democrats of his party.", "He also was opposed to mandatory drug sentencing for drug dealers in the state of Massachusetts.", "You cannot have a war on drugs, you cannot be tough on drugs and weak on crime.", " It's interesting to see that the Senator from Indiana, when we had a resolution on the floor of the United States Senate sponsored by Senator Dole, that this government would make no deal with Noriega - that the Senator from Indiana was one of the dozen senators that voted against it.", "It's also interesting to see that one of his campaign managers that's trying to help him with his image was also hired by Noriega to help him with his image in Panama.", "(Shouts and applause) What we have seen under this administration - we have seen them using eight cabinet officers, twenty-eight different agencies, all fighting over turf - and that is one thing we would correct under a Dukakis-Bentsen administration.", "We would put one person in charge in the war against drugs, and we would commit the resources to get that job done.", "Now, Mike Dukakis has been able to do that type of thing in the state of Massachusetts by cutting the drug use in the high schools while it's going up around the rest of the country, by putting in a drug educational program that the Drug Enforcement Agency said was a model to the country.", "We would be doing that around the rest of the country.", "That's a positive attack against drugs.", " I don't believe that it's proper for me to get into the specifics of a hypothetical situation like that.", "The situation is that if I was called upon to serve as the president of this country, or the responsibilities of the president of this country, would I be capable and qualified to do that?", "And I've tried to list the qualifications of twelve years in the United States Congress.", "I have served in the Congress for twelve years; I have served in the Congress and served eight years on the Senate Armed Services Committee.", "I have traveled a number of times - I've been to Geneva many times to meet with our negotiators as we were hammering out the INF Treaty; I've met with the western political leaders - Margaret Thatcher, Chancellor Kohl - I know them, they know me.", "I know what it takes to lead this country forward.", "And if that situation arises, yes, I will be prepared, and I will be prepared to lead this country, if that happens.", "(Applause)", " Once again I think what we are looking at here is someone that can step in at the presidency level at the moment, if that tragedy would occur.", "And if that's the case, again you have to look at maturity of judgment, and you have to look at breadth of experience.", "You have to see what kind of leadership roles that person has played in his life before that crisis struck him.", "And if you do that type of thing, then you arrive at a judgment that I think would be a wise one.", "And I hope that would mean that you would say we are going to vote for Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen.", "(Applause)", " I really must say, Brit, I don't make many mistakes, but that one was a real doozy.", "And I agree with that.", "And, as you know, I immediately disbanded it.", "It was perfectly legal.", "And you have all kinds of such clubs on the Hill - and you know that.", "But I still believe that the better way to go is to have a campaign reform law that takes care of that kind of a situation.", "Even though it's legal, the perception is bad.", "So I would push very strong to see that we reform the entire situation.", "I'd work for that end, and that's what my friend from Indiana has opposed repeatedly, vote after vote.", " He disbanded the club, but he's still got the money.", "He is the number one - he is the number one receiver of political action committee money.", "Now, Senator Bentsen has talked about reform.", "Well, let me tell you about the reform that we're pushing.", "Let's eliminate political action committees, the special interest money.", "There's legislation before the Congress to do that.", "That way, we won't have to worry about breakfast clubs, or who's the number one PAC raiser.", "We can go back and get the contributions from the working men and women and the individuals of America.", "We can also strengthen our two party system - and it needs strengthening - and rely more on the political parties than we have in the past.", "That's the kind of campaign reform that I'm for, and I hope the Senator will join me.", " Well, I think what you can do in that one, and which would be very helpful, is to use a lot more natural gas, which burns a lot cleaner.", "And what Mike Dukakis has said is that he'll try to break down those regulatory roadblocks that you have in the regulatory agency that denies much of the passage of that natural gas to the northeast, a way, in turn, can fight against acid rain which is another threat, because it's sterilizing our lakes, it's killing our fish.", "And it's interesting to me to see in the resume of Senator Quayle that he brags on the fact that he's been able to fight the acid rain legislation.", "I don't think that that's a proper objective in trying to clean up this environment.", "But the greenhouse effect is one that has to be a threat to all of us, and we have to look for alternative sources of fuel.", "And I've supported that very strongly.", "The Department of Energy is one that has cut back substantially on the study of those alternative sources of fuels.", "We can use other things that'll help the farmer.", "We can convert corn to ethanol, and I would push for that very strong.", "So absolutely.", "I'll do those things that are necessary to put the environment of our country number one.", "Because if we don't protect that, we'll destroy the future of our children.", "And we must be committed to trying - to clean up the water, clean up the air, and do everything we can, not only from a research standpoint, but also in the applied legislation to see that that's carried out.", " Vice President George Bush has said that he will take on the environmental problem.", "He has said further that he will deal with the acid rain legislation and reduce millions of tons of the S02 content.", "That legislation won't get through the Congress this year.", "But it will get through in a George Bush Administration, a George Bush Administration that is committed to the environment.", "Now the greenhouse effect is an important environmental issue.", "It is important for us to get the data in, to see what alternatives we might have to the fossil fuels, and make sure we know what we're doing.", "And there are some explorations and things that we can consider in this area.", "The drought highlighted the problem that we have, and therefore, we need to get on with it, and in a George Bush Administration, you can bet that we will.", " When you look at dealing with this total problem - i t's not just with the Japanese, but the underlying question on this total world debt problem - you have got to see, why are we a debtor, and what is attracting the foreign investment into our country today, whether it's Japanese or others.", "I would rather have people come over here and to make investments in this country, rather than going elsewhere.", "Because by coming over here, and making investments in this country, we are seeing jobs.", "Do you realize that today we are producing Hondas and exporting Hondas to Japan?", "We are the envy of the world.", "The United States - (Laughter)", " Some of Senator Bentsen's supporters laugh at that.", "They laugh at that because they don't believe that the United States of America is the envy of the world.", "Well, I can tell you, the American people think the United States of America is the envy of the world.", "(Applause)", " We are the greatest nation in this world, and the greatest economic power.", "Now, there's been some talk in Congress about forgiveness of debt.", "Forgiveness of debt is wrong.", "Forgiveness of international debt would be counterproductive.", "And I would like to see those that talk about forgiving debt, Senator Bentsen, go out and talk about a farmer that's in debt that doesn't have his forgiven.", "That's not the kind of policy George Bush will have.", " Well, I've told you what I'd do about trade and trying to help turn that situation around.", "But what we also should do is get them to give us more burden sharing when it comes to national defense.", "We have a situation today where, on a per capita basis, people in Western Europe are spending about one-third as much as we are in our country.", "And then when you go to Japan, where we're spending 6-1/2 percent on defense of the democracies, they're spending one percent.", "I met with some of the Japanese business leaders, talking to them about it.", "And I said, you know, we have 50,000 troops here in Japan, protecting the democracies of Asia.", "And it costs $3.5 billion a year.", "You're the number two economic power in the world.", "You ought to measure up to that responsibility and carry some of that cost.", "I said, if we were not doing what we're doing, we'd have a big budget surplus.", "And I said, you'd have chaos, because you get 55 percent of your oil from the Persian Gulf, and you wouldn't have the U.S. Navy down there to take care of that.", "Now, the Senator from Indiana, when we passed a resolution in the United States Senate to ask for burden sharing on that cost to keep those sea lanes open from the Japanese, he votes against that.", "I don't understand that.", " Let me try to answer the question one more time.", "I think this is the fourth time that I've had this question.", " Three times that I've had this question - and I will try to answer it again for you, as clearly as I can, because the question you are asking is what kind of qualifications does Dan Quayle have to be president, what kind of qualifications do I have and what would I do in this kind of a situation.", "And what would I do in this situation?", "I would make sure that the people in the cabinet and the people that are advisors to the president are called in, and I would talk to them, and I will work with them.", "And I will know them on a firsthand basis, because as vice president I will sit on the National Security Council.", "And I will know them on a firsthand basis, because I'm going to be coordinating the drug effort.", "I will know them on a firsthand basis because Vice President George Bush is going to recreate the Space Council, and I will be in charge of that.", "I will have day-to-day activities with all the people in government.", "And then, if that unfortunate situation happens - if that situation, which would be very tragic, happens, I will be prepared to carry out the responsibilities of the presidency of the United States of America.", "And I will be prepared to do that.", "I will be prepared not only because of my service in the Congress, but because of my ability to communicate and to lead.", " it's accomplishments, it's experience.", "I have far more experience than many others that sought the office of vice president of this country.", "I have as much experience in the Congress as Jack Kennedy did when he sought the presidency.", "I will be prepared to deal with the people in the Bush administration, if that unfortunate event would ever occur.", " Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy, I knew Jack Kennedy, Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine.", "Senator, you are no Jack Kennedy.", "(Prolonged shouts and applause) What has to be done in a situation like that is to call in the -", " That was really uncalled for, Senator.", "(Shouts and applause)", " You are the one that was making the comparison, Senator - and I'm one who knew him well.", "And frankly I think you are so far apart in the objectives you choose for your country that I did not think the comparison was well-taken.", " Tom, that's one of the toughest problems that any chief executive will face, because you can't help but have sympathy for that family, and for those hostages in the cells.", "But the one thing we ought to know by now is that you can't go out and make secret deals with the Ayatollah, you can't trade arms for hostages.", "When you try to do that there is no question but what you just encourage more taking of hostages.", "And that's been the result by this dumb idea that was cooked up in the White House basement.", "And I want to tell you that George Bush, attending seventeen of those meetings, and having no record of what he said - if Lloyd Bentsen was in those meetings, you would certainly hear from him and no one would be asking: Where is Lloyd?", "(Shouts and applause) Because I would be saying: That's a dumb idea, and now let's put an end to it.", "And I would speak up on that type of thing.", "So all you can do in that is to continue to push, use every bit of diplomatic pressure you can, what you can do in the way of economic pressure in addition to that.", "And that's what you would strive to do to have a successful release finally of those hostages.", "But not to encourage more taking of hostages.", " There's no doubt about it that arms for hostages is wrong, and it will never be repeated - we learn by our mistakes.", "But there have been a number of successes in foreign policy in this administration.", "But the question goes to a very difficult one: How do you do it?", "No one has the answer.", "If they did, we would certainly do it.", "But we will keep trying, we'll keep the doors open, and hopefully some day Iran and others who control those hostages will want to return to civilized international community.", "And they can do that, starting now, by releasing those hostages that are held illegally.", " Senator, much of the Dukakis and Bentsen campaign of late has been devoted to the notion that Senator Quayle isn't ready for the vice presidency and perhaps the presidency, and certainly nothing that you have said here tonight suggests that you think otherwise.", "I wonder if you think it's really fair for you to advance that view in light of the fact that you ran for the presidency, not the vice-presidency, in 1976 having not yet completed one full term in the Senate and having previously served three terms in the House almost a quarter of a century earlier, when in fact your time in Washington was about equal to what he has now.", " Well, I think what you have to look at is the record of a man who has served his country - (Shouts, laughter) - served his country in war, headed up a squadron in combat, a man who built a business, knew what it was to meet a payroll and create jobs, and then serve in the United States Senate; and one who has been able to bring about some of the kinds of legislation that I've been able to bring about in my service there.", "I must say I didn't do a very good job of running for the presidency, and I'm well aware of that.", "But what we are looking at today is trying to judge once again the breadth of experience and the maturity of someone taking on this kind of a task.", "That is the judgment that has to be exercised by the people of America.", "It's a presidential decision that you are facing, and a very important one, because we are talking about who is going to lead this country into its future.", "And you can't have a more important responsibility than that one.", " When you look at qualifications, you look at accomplishments as well as experience.", "And one of the accomplishments I'm proudest of is the authorship of the Job Training Partnership Act that has trained and educated and employed over three million young people and adults that are economically disadvantaged.", "And we did it in a way that we got the private sector to involve itself with the public sector on private industry councils throughout America that serve over the service delivery areas.", "We have 51 percent of that private industry council that are businessmen and women; we have members of unions; we have community-based organizations; we have education leaders.", "And what we have been able to do is establish a program that is working, that is putting people back to work.", "That is an accomplishment, and that is an accomplishment that I will take with me into the White House.", " In the last six months, I think there are three very important books that I read that have had an impact.", "The three books are, one, Richard Nixon's Victory in 1999, Richard Lugar's - Senator Richard Lugar's - Letters to the Next President, Bob Massey's Nicholas and Alexandra, which deals with the fall of the Russian empire and the coming of Leninism in 1917.", "Those three books, which I read over the last spring vacation and early summer, had a very definite impact, because what former President Nixon and Senator Richard Lugar were talking about was a foreign policy as we move toward the 21st century.", "And the historical book of the downfall of the czar and the coming of Leninism, combining those three books together, gave me a better appreciation of the challenges that we have ahead of us.", "In Senator Lugar's book, he talks about the advancement of human rights around the world; he talked about his leadership effort in the Philippines and South Africa, where we now see human rights advancement on the Reagan agenda.", "Former President Nixon talked about what we are going to do after detente and arms control, and how we are going to pursue new arms control with the Soviet Union; he talked a little bit about how we deal with the Soviet Union - and this is one of the differences between George Bush and Michael Dukakis, because George Bush understands that to deal with the Soviet Union and to get progress you must deal from a position of strength.", "And the governor of Massachusetts doesn't understand that.", "I understand it.", "And a George Bush administration will pursue that policy.", " Well, I think reading \"Winds of War\" and \"Guns of August\" back to back - I think that really shows you how we make the same mistakes too often, over and over again.", "And it seems to me that the Senator from Indiana is beginning to do that one.", "As I look toward our progress that's been made toward disarmament and cutting back on nuclear weapons and see what Ronald Reagan has been able to do with the INF treaty - and I think he deserves great credit with that one.", "I see a situation where the Senator from Indiana has now jumped off the reservation, when we talk about building on what Ronald Reagan has done and opposes what Ronald Reagan wants to do, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense and says let's go slow on further disarmament in trying to get the next treaty.", "I think that's a mistake.", "I think that you have to deal with the Russians from strength and we have to understand that you have to have a strong modernized nuclear deterrent, but I think we can make substantial progress and we ought to take advantage.", "I think he's arrived at a very dangerous judgment in the question of war and peace and it concerns me very much.", "Because I saw him also try to sabotage the INF treaty when it was on the Floor of the United States Senate with what he was doing there.", "He's listening once again to the winds of the radical right.", " My light was still on, Judy.", " John, we can't hear you.", " I can hear you.", "[Laughter.]", " All in two minutes?", " Let me start with the underlying premise, that somehow I haven't been straightforward.", "And I have.", "And let's go to the - right to the very first question - the Job Training Partnership Act.", "I was the author of that.", "The co-author in the United States Senate was Senator Kennedy.", "I was the Chairman of the Employment and Productivity Subcommittee.", "Chairmen of the committee write that legislation.", "Chairmen of the committee write the legislation and then they go out and get co-sponsorship.", "And when you are the chairman of the committee and you sit down and you write the legislation, you are the author of that.", "And I'm proud to have been the author of that.", "Because you know what we had, we had a CETA program that spent $50 billion from about 1973 through 1982 and when we concluded that program - when we concluded that program, unemployment was higher than when it began.", "It was a program that didn't work and the Job Training Partnership Act does work.", "Now, the issue of releasing all the - my grades - I am - and I stand before you tonight - as the most investigated person ever to seek public office.", "(Applause)", " Thousands of journalists have asked every professor I've had, all my teachers and they know - and I have never professed to be anything but an average student.", "I have never said I was anything more than that, but it's not whether you're an average study, it's what are you going to do with your life.", "And what have I - going to do with my life.", "I have committed it to public service since I was 29 years of age - elected to the House of Representatives.", "Elected to the United States Senate when I was 33.", "I now have the opportunity at 41 to seek the office of the Vice Presidency.", " I have absolutely no quarrel with Senator Quayle's military record.", "But I do strongly disagree with him on some of the issues.", "You make great patriotic speeches and I enjoy them, but I don't understand your vote on veterans issues.", "Senator Quayle has one of the worst voting records in the United States Senate on veterans issues.", "And one of them that particularly bothers me, sponsoring legislation to put a tax on combat pay and disability pay for veterans, for fighting men and women of America.", "Tax on their disability pay when they're lying there in the hospital, people who have sacrificed for our country.", "I think you ought to explain that to the people of America and you ought to explain it tonight.", " One of them that I'd work on - and I do this as a farmer - I try to turn the situation around where we have seen the subsidy payments go from two and a half billion to ten times that under this administration.", "And the way I would accomplish that--was with a tough trade policy, opening up those markets, getting those prices back up to market prices.", "We can do that if we have an aggressive trade policy for our country, if we make trade a number one priority and not trade it off for some foreign policy objective at the moment.", "That means we have to stand up for the American farmers and that cuts back on the regulation on American farmers.", "That's a positive way to accomplish that.", "In addition to that, we do some of the things that I think have to be done insofar as doing a better job of procurement, particularly when we're talking about some of our military things that we should buy.", "I know that I fought very hard to put in an independent inspector general for the Defense Department, that the Senator from Indiana opposed me on that.", "But we were finally able to put that into effect and we saved over a quarter of a billion dollars this year, almost enough to buy a squadron of 716s.", "Those are the kids of things that I'd work on.", "One of the things I learned in business is that you can expect what you inspect.", "So, we'd be a - doing a much tougher job of auditing, to try to get rid of some of these kickbacks to consultants on military contracts, to be much more aggressive on that.", "In addition, those types of things would bring the interest rate down.", "I'd try to turn this trade deficit around and that too would help us and help us very substantially.", "And I'd get rid of some things like these planes that - are going to have - that the administration wants that'll fly from New York to Tokyo and take those investment bankers over there in four hours.", "I don't think we can afford a piece of technological elegance like that.", "I'd strike that sort of thing from the ticket.", "I don't know how many people have ridden the Concorde, not many, but I voted against it, said it would be a financial disaster and it's been just that.", " So, those are the types of things that I would work on.", " The way we're going to reduce this budget deficit, and it is a challenge to make sure that it is reduce, is first to stick to the Gramm-Rudman targets.", "The Gramm-Rudman targets have worked.", "We've reduced the Federal budget deficit $70 billion.", "Senator Bentsen voted against Gramm-Rudman, the very tool that has been used to bring the Federal budget deficit down.", "We're going to need all the tools possible to bring this Federal budget deficit down.", "We need the tools of a line item veto.", "A line item veto that 43 governors in this country have, but not the President of the United States.", "The President of the United States needs to have a line item veto.", "When Congress goes ahead and puts into appropriations bills unrequested and unnecessary spending, let the President put a line through that, send it back to the Congress and let the Congress vote on it again.", "Congress has to help out in reducing this budget deficit as much as the Executive Branch.", " Michael Dukakis wasn't looking for a clone.", "I think it's part of the strength and the character of this land that he reaches out, and that he wants someone that will speak up - and that I'll do.", "I've seen many chief executives come into my office and say they're going over and tell the president of the United States off, they're going to pound the desk, and go into that office and turn to Jello.", "Now, I've dealt with many a president, and I don't hesitate for a minute to speak up.", "But when you're talking about something like the death penalty, where Michael Dukakis and I do disagree, what you really ought to get to is what's being done against crime, and what kind of progress he's been able to make.", "In the state of Massachusetts he has the homicide rate down to the lowest of any industrial state.", "It's substantially ahead of the national average.", "He's been able to do that with an educated program for the people of that state by adding some 1,500 new police officers; he's done it in turn by the leadership that I think he will bring to the ticket when he becomes president of the United States and fighting drugs.", "He's taken it down some four percent in the high schools of that state, while it's gone up about the rest of the nation.", "But you would seem him as president of the United States being very aggressive in this fight against crime, and having that kind of a successful result.", "And that's one of the reasons I'm delighted and proud to be on the ticket with him.", "Sure, we have some differences, but overall we have so many things we agree on.", "This situation of a trade policy, of cutting back on the deficit.", "Those are positive, plus things, and major issues facing our nation.", " One of the things that they don't agree on is in the area of national defense.", "National defense, and how we're going to preserve the freedom in this country.", "Michael Dukakis is the most liberal national Democrat to seek the office of presidency since George McGovern.", "He is for - he is against the MX missile, the midgetman, cutting two aircraft carriers.", "He is opposed to many defense programs that are necessary to defend this country.", "That's why former Secretary of Defense and former Energy Secretary in the Carter administration, Jim Schlesinger, in an open letter to Time magazine asked Governor Dukakis, \"are you viscerally anti-military?\"", "Jim Schlesinger never got an answer.", "And the reason he did is because the governor of Massachusetts doesn't want to answer former Secretary Jim Schlesinger on that very important question.", " There are a lot of experiences that I've had that have shaped my adult philosophy, but the one that I keep coming back to time and time again - and I talk about it at commencement addresses, I talk about it in the high schools.", "I talk about it when I visit the job training centers.", "And it's the advice that my maternal grandmother, Martha Pulliam, who's 97 years old.", "We are a modern day, four generation family.", "The advice that she gave me when I was growing up is advice that I've given my children, and I've given to a number of children, number of people.", "And it's very simple.", "It's very common sense.", "And she says, \"You can do anything you want to if you just set your mind to it, and go to work.\"", "Now, the Dukakis supporters sneer at that because it's common sense.", "(Laughter)", " They sneer at common sense advice.", "Midwestern advice.", "Midwestern advice from a grandmother to a grandson.", "Important advice.", "Something that we ought to talk about, because if you want to, you can make a difference.", "You, America can make a difference.", "You're going to have that choice come this election.", "Everyone can make a difference if they want to.", " I think being born and reared on the Rio Grande, to have spent part of my life seeing some of the struggles that have taken place in one of the lowest per capita incomes in the United States.", "And that's one of the reasons I worked so hard to try to assist on education.", "And when I found that the bankers in that area found that they could not handle the loans because of some of the detail and the expense, couldn't make a profit on it, I went down there and helped form a nonprofit organization, to buy out those loans from them, and to manage them, and do it in a way where they'd continue to make those loans.", "Now they have.", "And they've educated more than 20,000 of those students, loaned out over a hundred million dollars.", "And it hasn't cost the taxpayers of this country one cent.", "That's one of the reasons I've worked so hard to bring better health care to the people, because what I've seen in the way of poverty down there in that area, and the lack of medical attention, and trying to see that that's turned around; why I've worked so hard on the welfare reform bill--to give them a chance to break these cycles of poverty, a chance for a step up in life.", "Judy, something's happened.", "My light's still on.", " All right.", " Thank you.", "Tonight has been a very important evening.", "You have been able to see Dan Quayle as I really am, and how George Bush and I want to lead this country into the future.", "Thank you, America, for listening, and thank you for your fairness.", "Now you will have a choice to make on election day.", "You will have a choice of whether America is going to choose the road of Michael Dukakis or the road of George Bush as we march toward the 21st Century.", "The road of Michael Dukakis comes down to this: Bigger government, higher taxes.", "They've always believed in higher taxes; they always have, and they always will.", "Cuts in national defense.", "Back to the old economics of high interest rates, high inflation, and the old politics of high unemployment.", "Now the road of George Bush is the road to the future, and it comes down to this: An America second to none, with visions of greatness, economic expansion, tough laws, tough judges, strong values, respect for the flag and our institutions.", "George Bush will lead us to the 21st Century, a century that will be of hope and peace.", "Ronald Reagan and George Bush saved America from decline.", "We changed America.", "Michael Dukakis fought us every step of the way.", "It's not that they're not sympathetic; it's simply that they will take America backwards.", "George Bush has the experience, and with me, the future, a future committed to our family, a future committed to the freedom.", "Thank you, good night, and God bless you.", "(Applause)", " In just 34 days, America will elect new leadership for our country.", "It's a most important decision, because there's no bigger job than governing this great country of ours, and leading it into its future.", "Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen offer you experience, tempered, capable leadership, to meet those challenges of the future.", "Our opposition says lower your sights, rest on your laurels.", "Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen think America can do better, that America can't just coast into the future, clinging to the past.", "This race is too close.", "The competition is too tough, the stakes are too high.", "Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen think America must move into that future united in a commitment to make this country of ours the most powerful, the most prosperous nation in the world.", "As Americans, we honor our past, and we should.", "But our children are going to live in the future, and Mike Dukakis says the best of America is yet to come.", "But that won't happen.", "Taking care of our economy, just putting it on automatic pilot.", "It won't happen by accident.", "It's going to take leadership, and it's going to take courage.", "And the commitment, and a contribution by all of us to do that.", "I've worked for the betterment of our country, both in war and peace, as a bomber pilot, as one who has been a businessman, and a United States senator, working to make this nation the fairest and the strongest and the most powerful in the world.", "Help us bring America to a new era of greatness.", "The debate has been ours, but the decision is yours.", "God bless you.", "(Applause)", " Well, Alan (ph), thank you very much for the question.", "I want to first, obviously, thank Belmont University, Tom, thank you, and to all of you who are participating tonight and those of you who sent e-mail questions in.", "I think everybody knows now we are in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.", "And a lot of you I think are worried about your jobs, your pensions, your retirement accounts, your ability to send your child or your grandchild to college.", "And I believe this is a final verdict on the failed economic policies of the last eight years, strongly promoted by President Bush and supported by Senator McCain, that essentially said that we should strip away regulations, consumer protections, let the market run wild, and prosperity would rain down on all of us.", "It hasn't worked out that way.", "And so now we've got to take some decisive action.", " Now, step one was a rescue package that was passed last week.", "We've got to make sure that works properly.", "And that means strong oversight, making sure that investors, taxpayers are getting their money back and treated as investors.", "It means that we are cracking down on CEOs and making sure that they're not getting bonuses or golden parachutes as a consequence of this package.", "And, in fact, we just found out that AIG, a company that got a bailout, just a week after they got help went on a $400,000 junket.", "And I'll tell you what, the Treasury should demand that money back and those executives should be fired.", "But that's only step one.", "The middle-class need a rescue package.", "And that means tax cuts for the middle-class.", "It means help for homeowners so that they can stay in their homes.", "It means that we are helping state and local governments set up road projects and bridge projects that keep people in their jobs.", "And then long-term we've got to fix our health care system, we've got to fix our energy system that is putting such an enormous burden on families.", "You need somebody working for you and you've got to have somebody in Washington who is thinking about the middle class and not just those who can afford to hire lobbyists.", " Well, Warren would be a pretty good choice -- Warren Buffett, and I'm pleased to have his support.", "But there are other folks out there.", "The key is making sure that the next treasury secretary understands that it's not enough just to help those at the top.", "Prosperity is not just going to trickle down.", "We've got to help the middle class.", " And we've -- you know, Senator McCain and I have some fundamental disagreements on the economy, starting with Senator McCain's statement earlier that he thought the fundamentals of the economy were sound.", "Part of the problem here is that for many of you, wages and incomes have flat-lined.", "For many of you, it is getting harder and harder to save, harder and harder to retire.", "And that's why, for example, on tax policy, what I want to do is provide a middle class tax cut to 95 percent of working Americans, those who are working two jobs, people who are not spending enough time with their kids, because they are struggling to make ends meet.", "Senator McCain is right that we've got to stabilize housing prices.", "But underlying that is loss of jobs and loss of income.", "That's something that the next treasury secretary is going to have to work on.", " Well, Oliver, first, let me tell you what's in the rescue package for you.", "Right now, the credit markets are frozen up and what that means, as a practical matter, is that small businesses and some large businesses just can't get loans.", "If they can't get a loan, that means that they can't make payroll.", "If they can't make payroll, then they may end up having to shut their doors and lay people off.", "And if you imagine just one company trying to deal with that, now imagine a million companies all across the country.", "So it could end up having an adverse effect on everybody, and that's why we had to take action.", "But we shouldn't have been there in the first place.", "Now, I've got to correct a little bit of Senator McCain's history, not surprisingly.", "Let's, first of all, understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system.", "Senator McCain, as recently as March, bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator.", "On the other hand, two years ago, I said that we've got a sub-prime lending crisis that has to be dealt with.", "I wrote to Secretary Paulson, I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, and told them this is something we have to deal with, and nobody did anything about it.", "A year ago, I went to Wall Street and said we've got to reregulate, and nothing happened.", " And Senator McCain during that period said that we should keep on deregulating because that's how the free enterprise system works.", "Now, with respect to Fannie Mae, what Senator McCain didn't mention is the fact that this bill that he talked about wasn't his own bill.", "He jumped on it a year after it had been introduced and it never got passed.", "And I never promoted Fannie Mae.", "In fact, Senator McCain's campaign chairman's firm was a lobbyist on behalf of Fannie Mae, not me.", "So -- but, look, you're not interested in hearing politicians pointing fingers.", "What you're interested in is trying to figure out, how is this going to impact you?", "This is not the end of the process; this is the beginning of the process.", "And that's why it's going to be so important for us to work with homeowners to make sure that they can stay in their homes.", "The secretary already has the power to do that in the rescue package, but it hasn't been exercised yet.", "And the next president has to make sure that the next Treasury secretary is thinking about how to strengthen you as a home buyer, you as a homeowner, and not simply think about bailing out banks on Wall Street.", " No, I am confident about the American economy.", "But we are going to have to have some leadership from Washington that not only sets out much better regulations for the financial system.", "The problem is we still have a archaic, 20th-century regulatory system for 21st-century financial markets.", "We're going to have to coordinate with other countries to make sure that whatever actions we take work.", "But most importantly, we're going to have to help ordinary families be able to stay in their homes, make sure that they can pay their bills, deal with critical issues like health care and energy, and we're going to have to change the culture in Washington so that lobbyists and special interests aren't driving the process and your voices aren't being drowned out.", " Well, look, I understand your frustration and your cynicism, because while you've been carrying out your responsibilities -- most of the people here, you've got a family budget.", "If less money is coming in, you end up making cuts.", "Maybe you don't go out to dinner as much.", "Maybe you put off buying a new car.", "That's not what happens in Washington.", "And you're right.", "There is a lot of blame to go around.", "But I think it's important just to remember a little bit of history.", "When George Bush came into office, we had surpluses.", "And now we have half-a-trillion-dollar deficit annually.", "When George Bush came into office, our debt -- national debt was around $5 trillion.", "It's now over $10 trillion.", "We've almost doubled it.", "And so while it's true that nobody's completely innocent here, we have had over the last eight years the biggest increases in deficit spending and national debt in our history.", "And Senator McCain voted for four out of five of those George Bush budgets.", "So here's what I would do.", "I'm going to spend some money on the key issues that we've got to work on.", " You know, you may have seen your health care premiums go up.", "We've got to reform health care to help you and your budget.", "We are going to have to deal with energy because we can't keep on borrowing from the Chinese and sending money to Saudi Arabia.", "We are mortgaging our children's future.", "We've got to have a different energy plan.", "We've got to invest in college affordability.", "So we're going to have to make some investments, but we've also got to make spending cuts.", "And what I've proposed, you'll hear Senator McCain say, well, he's proposing a whole bunch of new spending, but actually I'm cutting more than I'm spending so that it will be a net spending cut.", "The key is whether or not we've got priorities that are working for you as opposed to those who have been dictating the policy in Washington lately, and that's mostly lobbyists and special interests.", "We've got to put an end to that.", " We're going to have to prioritize, just like a family has to prioritize.", "Now, I've listed the things that I think have to be at the top of the list.", "Energy we have to deal with today, because you're paying $3.80 here in Nashville for gasoline, and it could go up.", "And it's a strain on your family budget, but it's also bad for our national security, because countries like Russia and Venezuela and, you know, in some cases, countries like Iran, are benefiting from higher oil prices.", "So we've got to deal with that right away.", "That's why I've called for an investment of $15 billion a year over 10 years.", "Our goal should be, in 10 year's time, we are free of dependence on Middle Eastern oil.", "And we can do it.", "Now, when JFK said we're going to the Moon in 10 years, nobody was sure how to do it, but we understood that, if the American people make a decision to do something, it gets done.", "So that would be priority number one.", "Health care is priority number two, because that broken health care system is bad not only for families, but it's making our businesses less competitive.", "And, number three, we've got to deal with education so that our young people are competitive in a global economy.", "But just one point I want to make, Tom.", "Senator McCain mentioned looking at our records.", "We do need to look at our records.", "Senator McCain likes to talk about earmarks a lot.", "And that's important.", "I want to go line by line through every item in the federal budget and eliminate programs that don't work and make sure that those that do work, work better and cheaper.", "But understand this: We also have to look at where some of our tax revenues are going.", "So when Senator McCain proposes a $300 billion tax cut, a continuation not only of the Bush tax cuts, but an additional $200 billion that he's going to give to big corporations, including big oil companies, $4 billion worth, that's money out of the system.", "And so we've got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that they're working for you.", "That's what I'm going to do as president of the United States.", " You know, a lot of you remember the tragedy of 9/11 and where you were on that day and, you know, how all of the country was ready to come together and make enormous changes to make us not only safer, but to make us a better country and a more unified country.", "And President Bush did some smart things at the outset, but one of the opportunities that was missed was, when he spoke to the American people, he said, \"Go out and shop.\"", "That wasn't the kind of call to service that I think the American people were looking for.", "And so it's important to understand that the -- I think the American people are hungry for the kind of leadership that is going to tackle these problems not just in government, but outside of government.", "And let's take the example of energy, which we already spoke about.", "There is going to be the need for each and every one of us to start thinking about how we use energy.", "I believe in the need for increased oil production.", "We're going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling.", "It includes telling the oil companies, that currently have 68 million acres that they're not using, that either you use them or you lose them.", "We're going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy.", "But each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes, in our buildings.", "And one of the things I want to do is make sure that we're providing incentives so that you can buy a fuel efficient car that's made right here in the United States of America, not in Japan or South Korea, making sure that you are able to weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient.", "And that's going to require effort from each and every one of us.", "And the last point I just want to make.", "I think the young people of America are especially interested in how they can serve, and that's one of the reasons why I'm interested in doubling the Peace Corps, making sure that we are creating a volunteer corps all across this country that can be involved in their community, involved in military service, so that military families and our troops are not the only ones bearing the burden of renewing America.", "That's something that all of us have to be involved with and that requires some leadership from Washington.", " Well, I think it starts with Washington.", "We've got to show that we've got good habits, because if we're running up trillion dollar debts that we're passing on to the next generation, then a lot of people are going to think, \"Well, you know what?", "There's easy money out there.\"", "It means -- and I have to, again, repeat this.", "It means looking (ph) at the spending side, but also at the revenue side.", "I mean, Senator McCain has been talking tough about earmarks, and that's good, but earmarks account for about $18 billion of our budget.", "Now, when Senator McCain is proposing tax cuts that would give the average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts, that's not sharing a burden.", "And so part of the problem, I think, for a lot of people who are listening here tonight is they don't feel as if they are sharing the burden with other folks.", "I mean, you know, it's tough to ask a teacher who's making $30,000 or $35,000 a year to tighten her belt when people who are making much more than her are living pretty high on the hog.", "And that's why I think it's important for the president to set a tone that says all of us are going to contribute, all of us are going to make sacrifices, and it means that, yes, we may have to cut some spending, although I disagree with Senator McCain about an across-the- board freeze.", "That's an example of an unfair burden sharing.", "That's using a hatchet to cut the federal budget.", " I want to use a scalpel so that people who need help are getting help and those of us, like myself and Senator McCain, who don't need help, aren't getting it.", "That's how we make sure that everybody is willing to make a few sacrifices.", " Tom, can I respond to this briefly?", "Because...", " The tax issue, because I think it's very important.", "Go ahead.", " Well, Tom, we're going to have to take on entitlements and I think we've got to do it quickly.", "We're going to have a lot of work to do, so I can't guarantee that we're going to do it in the next two years, but I'd like to do in the my first term as president.", "But I think it's important to understand, we're not going to solve Social Security and Medicare unless we understand the rest of our tax policies.", "And you know, Senator McCain, I think the \"Straight Talk Express\" lost a wheel on that one.", "So let's be clear about my tax plan and Senator McCain's, because we're not going to be able to deal with entitlements unless we understand the revenues coming in.", "I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of Americans, 95 percent.", "If you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year, you will not see a single dime of your taxes go up.", "If you make $200,000 a year or less, your taxes will go down.", "Now, Senator McCain talks about small businesses.", "Only a few percent of small businesses make more than $250,000 a year.", "So the vast majority of small businesses would get a tax cut under my plan.", "And we provide a 50 percent tax credit so that they can buy health insurance for their workers, because there are an awful lot of small businesses that I meet across America that want to do right by their workers but they just can't afford it.", "Some small business owners, a lot of them, can't even afford health insurance for themselves.", "Now, in contrast, Senator McCain wants to give a $300 billion tax cut, $200 billion of it to the largest corporations and a hundred thousand of it -- a hundred billion of it going to people like CEOs on Wall Street.", "He wants to give average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts.", "That is not fair.", "And it doesn't work.", " Now, if we get our tax policies right so that they're good for the middle class, if we reverse the policies of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place and that Senator McCain supported, then we are going to be in a position to deal with Social Security and deal with Medicare, because we will have a health care plan that actually works for you, reduces spending and costs over the long term, and Social Security that is stable and solvent for all Americans and not just some.", " This is one of the biggest challenges of our times.", " And it is absolutely critical that we understand this is not just a challenge, it's an opportunity, because if we create a new energy economy, we can create five million new jobs, easily, here in the United States.", "It can be an engine that drives us into the future the same way the computer was the engine for economic growth over the last couple of decades.", "And we can do it, but we're going to have to make an investment.", "The same way the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out, for defense purposes, how to communicate, we've got to understand that this is a national security issue, as well.", "And that's why we've got to make some investments and I've called for investments in solar, wind, geothermal.", "Contrary to what Senator McCain keeps on saying, I favor nuclear power as one component of our overall energy mix.", "But this is another example where I think it is important to look at the record.", "Senator McCain and I actually agree on something.", "He said a while back that the big problem with energy is that for 30 years, politicians in Washington haven't done anything.", "What Senator McCain doesn't mention is he's been there 26 of them.", "And during that time, he voted 23 times against alternative fuels, 23 times.", "So it's easy to talk about this stuff during a campaign, but it's important for us to understand that it requires a sustained effort from the next president.", "One last point I want to make on energy.", "Senator McCain talks a lot about drilling, and that's important, but we have three percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.", "So what that means is that we can't simply drill our way out of the problem.", "And we're not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global warming.", "We're going to have to come up with alternatives, and that means that the United States government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like China that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week.", "We've got to make sure that we're giving them the energy that they need or helping them to create the energy that they need.", " I'm just trying to keep up with John.", " Well, you know, as I travel around the country, this is one of the single most frequently asked issues that I get, is the issue of health care.", "It is breaking family budgets.", "I can't tell you how many people I meet who don't have health insurance.", "If you've got health insurance, most of you have seen your premiums double over the last eight years.", "And your co-payments and deductibles have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alone.", "If you're a small business, it's a crushing burden.", "So one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing.", "So here's what I would do.", "If you've got health care already, and probably the majority of you do, then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it.", "You can keep your choice of doctor.", "We're going to work with your employer to lower the cost of your premiums by up to $2,500 a year.", "And we're going to do it by investing in prevention.", "We're going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital.", "That will reduce medical errors and reduce costs.", "If you don't have health insurance, you're going to be able to buy the same kind of insurance that Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees.", "Because there's a huge pool, we can drop the costs.", "And nobody will be excluded for pre-existing conditions, which is a huge problem.", "Now, Senator McCain has a different kind of approach.", "He says that he's going to give you a $5,000 tax credit.", "What he doesn't tell you is that he is going to tax your employer-based health care benefits for the first time ever.", "So what one hand giveth, the other hand taketh away.", "He would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure you're not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered.", "And that is fundamentally the wrong way to go.", "In fact, just today business organizations like the United States Chamber of Commerce, which generally are pretty supportive of Republicans, said that this would lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system.", "That, I don't think, is the kind of change that we need.", "We've got to have somebody who is fighting for patients and making sure that you get decent, affordable health care.", "And that's something that I'm committed to doing as president.", " Well, why don't -- why don't -- let's talk about this, Tom, because there was just a lot of stuff out there.", " Well, I think it should be a right for every American.", "In a country as wealthy as ours, for us to have people who are going bankrupt because they can't pay their medical bills -- for my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because they're saying that this may be a pre-existing condition and they don't have to pay her treatment, there's something fundamentally wrong about that.", "So let me -- let me just talk about this fundamental difference.", "And, Tom, I know that we're under time constraints, but Senator McCain through a lot of stuff out there.", "Number one, let me just repeat, if you've got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it.", "All I'm going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it.", "You'll still have choice of doctor.", "There's no mandate involved.", "Small businesses are not going to have a mandate.", "What we're going to give you is a 50 percent tax credit to help provide health care for those that you need.", "Now, it's true that I say that you are going to have to make sure that your child has health care, because children are relatively cheap to insure and we don't want them going to the emergency room for treatable illnesses like asthma.", "And when Senator McCain says that he wants to provide children health care, what he doesn't mention is he voted against the expansion of the Children's Health Insurance Program that is responsible for making sure that so many children who didn't have previously health insurance have it now.", "Now, the final point I'll make on this whole issue of government intrusion and mandates -- it is absolutely true that I think it is important for government to crack down on insurance companies that are cheating their customers, that don't give you the fine print, so you end up thinking that you're paying for something and, when you finally get sick and you need it, you're not getting it.", "And the reason that it's a problem to go shopping state by state, you know what insurance companies will do?", "They will find a state -- maybe Arizona, maybe another state -- where there are no requirements for you to get cancer screenings, where there are no requirements for you to have to get pre-existing conditions, and they will all set up shop there.", "That's how in banking it works.", "Everybody goes to Delaware, because they've got very -- pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards.", "And in that situation, what happens is, is that the protections you have, the consumer protections that you need, you're not going to have available to you.", "That is a fundamental difference that I have with Senator McCain.", "He believes in deregulation in every circumstance.", "That's what we've been going through for the last eight years.", "It hasn't worked, and we need fundamental change.", " Well, you know, Senator McCain, in the last debate and today, again, suggested that I don't understand.", "It's true.", "There are some things I don't understand.", "I don't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us.", "That was Senator McCain's judgment and it was the wrong judgment.", "When Senator McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq, he suggested it was going to be quick and easy, we'd be greeted as liberators.", "That was the wrong judgment, and it's been costly to us.", "So one of the difficulties with Iraq is that it has put an enormous strain, first of all, on our troops, obviously, and they have performed heroically and honorably and we owe them an extraordinary debt of gratitude.", "But it's also put an enormous strain on our budget.", "We've spent, so far, close to $700 billion and if we continue on the path that we're on, as Senator McCain is suggesting, it's going to go well over $1 trillion.", "We're spending $10 billion a month in Iraq at a time when the Iraqis have a $79 billion surplus, $79 billion.", "And we need that $10 billion a month here in the United States to put people back to work, to do all these wonderful things that Senator McCain suggested we should be doing, but has not yet explained how he would pay for.", "Now, Senator McCain and I do agree, this is the greatest nation on earth.", "We are a force of good in the world.", "But there has never been a nation in the history of the world that saw its economy decline and maintained its military superiority.", "And the strains that have been placed on our alliances around the world and the respect that's been diminished over the last eight years has constrained us being able to act on something like the genocide in Darfur, because we don't have the resources or the allies to do everything that we should be doing.", "That's going to change when I'm president, but we can't change it unless we fundamentally change Senator McCain's and George Bush's foreign policy.", "It has not worked for America.", " Well, we may not always have national security issues at stake, but we have moral issues at stake.", "If we could have intervened effectively in the Holocaust, who among us would say that we had a moral obligation not to go in?", "If we could've stopped Rwanda, surely, if we had the ability, that would be something that we would have to strongly consider and act.", "So when genocide is happening, when ethnic cleansing is happening somewhere around the world and we stand idly by, that diminishes us.", " And so I do believe that we have to consider it as part of our interests, our national interests, in intervening where possible.", "But understand that there's a lot of cruelty around the world.", "We're not going to be able to be everywhere all the time.", "That's why it's so important for us to be able to work in concert with our allies.", "Let's take the example of Darfur just for a moment.", "Right now there's a peacekeeping force that has been set up and we have African Union troops in Darfur to stop a genocide that has killed hundreds of thousands of people.", "We could be providing logistical support, setting up a no-fly zone at relatively little cost to us, but we can only do it if we can help mobilize the international community and lead.", "And that's what I intend to do when I'm president.", " Katie, it's a terrific question and we have a difficult situation in Pakistan.", "I believe that part of the reason we have a difficult situation is because we made a bad judgment going into Iraq in the first place when we hadn't finished the job of hunting down bin Laden and crushing al Qaeda.", "So what happened was we got distracted, we diverted resources, and ultimately bin Laden escaped, set up base camps in the mountains of Pakistan in the northwest provinces there.", "They are now raiding our troops in Afghanistan, destabilizing the situation.", "They're stronger now than at any time since 2001.", "And that's why I think it's so important for us to reverse course, because that's the central front on terrorism.", "They are plotting to kill Americans right now.", "As Secretary Gates, the defense secretary, said, the war against terrorism began in that region and that's where it will end.", "So part of the reason I think it's so important for us to end the war in Iraq is to be able to get more troops into Afghanistan, put more pressure on the Afghan government to do what it needs to do, eliminate some of the drug trafficking that's funding terrorism.", "But I do believe that we have to change our policies with Pakistan.", "We can't coddle, as we did, a dictator, give him billions of dollars and then he's making peace treaties with the Taliban and militants.", " What I've said is we're going to encourage democracy in Pakistan, expand our nonmilitary aid to Pakistan so that they have more of a stake in working with us, but insisting that they go after these militants.", "And if we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then I think that we have to act and we will take them out.", "We will kill bin Laden; we will crush Al Qaida.", "That has to be our biggest national security priority.", " Tom, just a...", " ... just a quick follow-up on this.", "I think...", " Then let's have one.", " Just -- just -- just a quick follow-up, because I think -- I think this is important.", " You're doing a great job, Tom.", "Look, I -- I want to be very clear about what I said.", "Nobody called for the invasion of Pakistan.", "Senator McCain continues to repeat this.", "What I said was the same thing that the audience here today heard me say, which is, if Pakistan is unable or unwilling to hunt down bin Laden and take him out, then we should.", "Now, that I think has to be our policy, because they are threatening to kill more Americans.", "Now, Senator McCain suggests that somehow, you know, I'm green behind the ears and, you know, I'm just spouting off, and he's somber and responsible.", " Senator McCain, this is the guy who sang, \"Bomb, bomb, bomb Iran,\" who called for the annihilation of North Korea.", "That I don't think is an example of \"speaking softly.\"", "This is the person who, after we had -- we hadn't even finished Afghanistan, where he said, \"Next up, Baghdad.\"", "So I agree that we have to speak responsibly and we have to act responsibly.", "And the reason Pakistan -- the popular opinion of America had diminished in Pakistan was because we were supporting a dictator, Musharraf, had given him $10 billion over seven years, and he had suspended civil liberties.", "We were not promoting democracy.", "This is the kind of policies that ultimately end up undermining our ability to fight the war on terrorism, and it will change when I'm president.", " I'll be very brief.", "We are going to have to make the Iraqi government start taking more responsibility, withdraw our troops in a responsible way over time, because we're going to have to put some additional troops in Afghanistan.", "General McKiernan, the commander in Afghanistan right now, is desperate for more help, because our bases and outposts are now targets for more aggressive Afghan -- Taliban offenses.", "We're also going to have to work with the Karzai government, and when I met with President Karzai, I was very clear that, \"You are going to have to do better by your people in order for us to gain the popular support that's necessary.\"", "I don't think he has to be a dictator.", "And we want a democracy in Afghanistan.", "But we have to have a government that is responsive to the Afghan people, and, frankly, it's just not responsive right now.", " Well, the resurgence of Russia is one of the central issues that we're going to have to deal with in the next presidency.", "And for the most part I agree with Senator McCain on many of the steps that have to be taken.", "But we can't just provide moral support.", "We've got to provide moral support to the Poles and Estonia and Latvia and all of the nations that were former Soviet satellites.", "But we've also got to provide them with financial and concrete assistance to help rebuild their economies.", "Georgia in particular is now on the brink of enormous economic challenges.", "And some say that that's what Putin intended in the first place.", "The other thing we have to do, though, is we've got to see around the corners.", "We've got to anticipate some of these problems ahead of time.", "You know, back in April, I put out a statement saying that the situation in Georgia was unsustainable because you had Russian peacekeepers in these territories that were under dispute.", "And you knew that if the Russians themselves were trying to obtain some of these territories or push back against Georgia, that that was not a stable situation.", "So part of the job of the next commander-in-chief, in keeping all of you safe, is making sure that we can see some of the 21st Century challenges and anticipate them before they happen.", "We haven't been doing enough of that.", "We tend to be reactive.", "That's what we've been doing over the last eight years and that has actually made us more safe.", "That's part of what happened in Afghanistan, where we rushed into Iraq and Senator McCain and President Bush suggested that it wasn't that important to catch bin Laden right now and that we could muddle through, and that has cost us dearly.", "We've got to be much more strategic if we're going to be able to deal with all of the challenges that we face out there.", "And one last point I want to make about Russia.", "Energy is going to be key in dealing with Russia.", "If we can reduce our energy consumption, that reduces the amount of petro dollars that they have to make mischief around the world.", "That will strengthen us and weaken them when it comes to issues like Georgia.", " I think they've engaged in an evil behavior and I think that it is important that we understand they're not the old Soviet Union but they still have nationalist impulses that I think are very dangerous.", " Well, Terry, first of all, we honor your service, and we're grateful for it.", "We cannot allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon.", "It would be a game-changer in the region.", "Not only would it threaten Israel, our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world, but it would also create a possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists.", "And so it's unacceptable.", "And I will do everything that's required to prevent it.", "And we will never take military options off the table.", "And it is important that we don't provide veto power to the United Nations or anyone else in acting in our interests.", "It is important, though, for us to use all the tools at our disposal to prevent the scenario where we've got to make those kinds of choices.", "And that's why I have consistently said that, if we can work more effectively with other countries diplomatically to tighten sanctions on Iran, if we can reduce our energy consumption through alternative energy, so that Iran has less money, if we can impose the kinds of sanctions that, say, for example, Iran right now imports gasoline, even though it's an oil-producer, because its oil infrastructure has broken down, if we can prevent them from importing the gasoline that they need and the refined petroleum products, that starts changing their cost-benefit analysis.", "That starts putting the squeeze on them.", "Now, it is true, though, that I believe that we should have direct talks -- not just with our friends, but also with our enemies -- to deliver a tough, direct message to Iran that, if you don't change your behavior, then there will be dire consequences.", "If you do change your behavior, then it is possible for you to re-join the community of nations.", "Now, it may not work.", "But one of the things we've learned is, is that when we take that approach, whether it's in North Korea or in Iran, then we have a better chance at better outcomes.", "When President Bush decided we're not going to talk to Iran, we're not going to talk to North Korea, you know what happened?", "Iran went from zero centrifuges to develop nuclear weapons to 4,000.", "North Korea quadrupled its nuclear capability.", "We've got to try to have talks, understanding that we're not taking military options off the table.", " My wife, Michelle, is there and she could give you a much longer list than I do.", "And most of the time, I learn it by asking her.", "But, look, the nature of the challenges that we're going to face are immense and one of the things that we know about the presidency is that it's never the challenges that you expect.", "It's the challenges that you don't that end up consuming most of your time.", "But here's what I do know.", "I know that I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for the fact that this country gave me opportunity.", "I came from very modest means.", "I had a single mom and my grandparents raised me and it was because of the help of scholarships and my grandmother scrimping on things that she might have wanted to purchase and my mom, at one point, getting food stamps in order for us to put food on the table.", "Despite all that, I was able to go to the best schools on earth and I was able to succeed in a way that I could not have succeeded anywhere else in this country.", "The same is true for Michelle and I'm sure the same is true for a lot of you.", "And the question in this election is: are we going to pass on that same American dream to the next generation?", "Over the last eight years, we've seen that dream diminish.", "Wages and incomes have gone down.", "People have lost their health care or are going bankrupt because they get sick.", "We've got young people who have got the grades and the will and the drive to go to college, but they just don't have the money.", "And we can't expect that if we do the same things that we've been doing over the last eight years, that somehow we are going to have a different outcome.", "We need fundamental change.", "That's what's at stake in this election.", "That's the reason I decided to run for president, and I'm hopeful that all of you are prepared to continue this extraordinary journey that we call America.", "But we're going to have to have the courage and the sacrifice, the nerve to move in a new direction.", "Thank you.", " Senator McCain, you get the last word.", "Senator Obama had the opening.", "You're last up.", " I have, I have.", "First question is what's in the best interests of the United States?", "What's in the best interests of our people?", "When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question.", "Is it in our nation's interests?", "Peace in the Middle East is in our nation's interests.", "Having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nation's interests.", "Strong relations in Europe is in our nation's interest.", "I've thought a lot about what it means to be the president.", "I also understand that an administration is not one person, but an administration is dedicated citizens who are called by the president to serve the country, to serve a cause greater than self, and so I've thought about an administration of people who represent all America, but people who understand my compassionate and conservative philosophy.", "I haven't started naming names except for one person, and that's Mr. Richard Cheney who I thought did a great job the other night.", "He's a vice presidential nominee who represents -- I think people got to see why I picked him.", "He's man of solid judgment and he's going to be a person to stand by my side.", "One of the things I've done in Texas is I've been able to put together a good team of people.", "I've been able to set clear goals.", "The goals ought to be an education system that leaves no child behind, Medicare for our seniors, a Social Security system that's safe and secure, foreign policy that's in our nation's interest, and a strong military, and then bring people together to achieve those goals.", "That's what a Chief Executive Officer does.", "So I've thought long and hard about the honor of being the President of the United States.", " Yes, Jim.", "I've thought a lot about that particular question, and I see our greatest national strength coming from what we stand for in the world.", "I see it as a question of values.", "It is a great tribute to our founders that 224 years later this nation is now looked to by the peoples on every other continent and the peoples from every part of this earth as a kind of model for what their future could be.", "And I don't think that's just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans.", "It's really true, even the ones that sometimes shake their fists at us.", "As soon as they have a change that allows the people to speak freely, they're wanting to develop some kind of blueprint that will help them be like us more, freedom, free markets, political freedom.", "So I think first and foremost our power ought to be wielded to in ways that form a more perfect union.", "The power of example is America's greatest power in the world.", "And that means, for example, standing up for human rights.", "It means addressing the problems of injustice and inequity, along the lines of race and ethnicity here at home, because in all these other places around the world where they're having these terrible problems, when they feel hope, it is often because they see in us a reflection of their potential.", "So we've got to enforce our civil rights laws.", "We've got to deal with things like racial profiling.", "And we have to keep our military strong.", "We have the strongest military, and I'll do whatever is necessary, if I'm president, to make sure that it stays that way.", "But our real power comes, I think, from our values.", " Well, I think they ought to look at us as a country that understands freedom where it doesn't matter who you are or how you're raised or where you're from, that you can succeed.", "I don't think they'll look at us with envy.", "It really depends upon how our nation conducts itself in foreign policy.", "If we're an arrogant nation, they'll resent us.", "If we're a humble nation, but strong, they'll welcome us.", "And it's -- our nation stands alone right now in the world in terms of power, and that's why we have to be humble.", "And yet project strength in a way that promotes freedom.", "So I don't think they ought to look at us in any way other than what we are.", "We're a freedom-loving nation and if we're an arrogant nation they'll view us that way, but if we're a humble nation they'll respect us.", " I agree with that.", "I agree with that.", "I think that one of the problems that we have faced in the world is that we are so much more powerful than any single nation has been in relationship to the rest of the world than at any time in history, that I know about, anyway.", "That there is some resentment of U.S. power.", "So I think that the idea of humility is an important one.", "But I think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world.", "We have to protect our capacity to push forward what America's all about.", "That means not only military strength and our values, it also means keeping our economy strong.", "You know, in the last, or two decades ago, it was routine for leaders of foreign countries to come over here and say you guys have got to do something about these horrendous deficits because it's causing tremendous problems for the rest of the world, and we were lectured to all the time.", "The fact that we have the strongest economy in history today is not good enough.", "We need to do more.", "But the fact that it is so strong enables us to project the power for good that America can represent.", " Yes, it does.", "Take, for example, Third World debt.", "I think we ought to be forgiving Third World debt under certain conditions.", "I think, for example, if we're convinced that a Third World country that's got a lot of debt would reform itself, that the money wouldn't go into the hands of a few but would go to help people, I think it makes sense for us to use our wealth in that way, or to trade debt for valuable rain forest lands, makes that much sense, yes.", "We do have an obligation, but we can't be all things to all people.", "We can help build coalitions but we can't put our troops all around the world.", "We can lend money but we have to do it wisely.", "We shouldn't be lending money to corrupt officials.", "So we got to be guarded in our generosity.", " The first priority has to be on ending the violence, dampening down the tensions that have arisen there.", "We need to call upon Syria to release the three Israeli soldiers who have been captured.", "We need to insist that Arafat send out instructions to halt some of the provocative acts of violence that have been going on.", "I think that we also have to keep a weather eye toward Saddam Hussein because he is taking advantage of this situation to once again make threats, and he needs to understand that he's not only dealing with Israel, he is dealing -- he's dealing with us if he is making the kind of threats that he's talking about there.", "The use of diplomacy in this situation has already, well, it goes hour-by-hour and day-by-day now.", "It's a very tense situation there.", "But in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there.", "It's too much to hope that this is going to continue, but I do hope that it will continue.", "Our country has been very active with regular conversations with the leaders there.", "And we just have to take it day-to-day right now.", "But one thing I would say where diplomacy is concerned, Israel should feel absolutely secure about one thing.", "Our bonds with Israel are larger than agreements or disagreements on some details of diplomatic initiatives.", "They are historic, they are strong, and they are enduring.", "And our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shepherd.", " Well, I think during the campaign, particularly now during this difficult period, we ought to be speaking with one voice, and I appreciate the way the administration has worked hard to calm the tensions.", "Like the vice president, I call on Chairman Arafat to have his people pull back to make the peace.", "I think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the Middle East.", "I want everybody to know should I be the president Israel's going to be our friend.", "I'm going to stand by Israel.", "Secondly, that I think it's important to reach out to moderate Arab nations, like Jordan and Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.", "It's important to be friends with people when you don't need each other so that when you do there's a strong bond of friendship.", "And that's going to be particularly important in dealing not only with situations such as now occurring in Israel, but with Saddam Hussein.", "The coalition against Saddam has fallen apart or it's unraveling, let's put it that way.", "The sanctions are being violated.", "We don't know whether he's developing weapons of mass destruction.", "He better not be or there's going to be a consequence should I be the president.", "But it's important to have credibility and credibility is formed by being strong with your friends and resolute in your determination.", "One of the reasons why I think it's important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace to be able to say to the Saddam Hussein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of the world or the Iranians, don't dare threaten our friends.", "It's also important to keep strong ties in the Middle East, credible ties, because of the energy crisis we're now in.", "After all, a lot of the energy is produced from the Middle East, and so I appreciate what the administration is doing.", "I hope to get a sense of should I be fortunate to be the president how my administration will react to the Middle East.", " Well, we stand with Israel, but we have maintained the ability to serve as an honest broker.", "And one of the reasons that's important is that Israel cannot have direct dialogue with some of the people on the other side of conflicts, especially during times of tension, unless that dialogue comes through us.", "And if we throw away that ability to serve as an honest broker, then we have thrown -- we will have thrown away a strategic asset that's important not only to us but also to Israel.", " I do.", "I do think this, though.", "When it comes to timetables it can't be the United States timetable as to how discussions take place.", "It's got to be a timetable that all parties can agree to, like the Palestinians and Israelis.", "Secondly, any lasting peace is going to have to be a peace that's good for both sides.", "And therefore, the term honest broker makes sense.", "This current administration's worked hard to keep the parties at the table.", "I will try to do the same thing.", "But it won't be on my timetable, it will be on the timetable that people are comfortable with in the Middle East.", " I haven't heard a big difference in the last few exchanges.", " That's hard to tell.", "I think that, you know, I would hope to be able to convince people I could handle the Iraqi situation better.", " I would like to, of course, and I presume this administration would as well.", "We don't know -- there are no inspectors now in Iraq, the coalition that was in place isn't as strong as it used to be.", "He is a danger.", "We don't want him fishing in troubled waters in the Middle East.", "And it's going to be hard, it's going to be important to rebuild that coalition to keep the pressure on him.", " I do.", " Well, when I got to be a part of the current administration, it was right after -- I was one of the few members of my political party to support former President Bush in the Persian Gulf War resolution, and at the end of that war, for whatever reason, it was not finished in a way that removed Saddam Hussein from power.", "I know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations.", "But the fact is that that's the situation that was left when I got there.", "And we have maintained the sanctions.", "Now I want to go further.", "I want to give robust support to the groups that are trying to overthrow Saddam Hussein, and I know there are allegations that they're too weak to do it, but that's what they said about the forces that were opposing Milosevic in Serbia, and you know, the policy of enforcing sanctions against Serbia has just resulted in a spectacular victory for democracy just in the past week, and it seems to me that having taken so long to see the sanctions work there, building upon the policy of containment that was successful over a much longer period of time against the former Soviet Union in the communist block, seems a little early to declare that we should give up on the sanctions.", "I know the governor's not necessarily saying that but, you know, all of these flights that have come in, all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime, I'm told, except for three where they notified, and they're trying to break out of the box, there's no question about it.", "I don't think they should be allowed to.", " No, of course not, absolutely not, I want them to be tougher.", " I think it's a triumph.", "I thought the president made the right decision in joining NATO and bombing Serbia.", "I supported them when they did so.", "I called upon the Congress not to hamstring the administration, and in terms of forcing troop withdrawals on a timetable that wasn't necessarily in our best interest or fit our nation's strategy, and so I think it's good public policy, I think it worked, and I'm pleased I took -- made the decision I made.", "I'm pleased the president made the decision he made.", "Because freedom took hold in that part of the world, but there's a lot of work left to be done, however.", " Yes, I think it is.", "Absolutely.", "I don't think he would have fallen had we not used the force.", "And I know there are some in our party that disagree with that sentiment.", "I supported the president.", "I thought he made the right decision to do so.", "I didn't think he necessarily made the right decision to take land troops off the table right before we committed ourselves offensively, but nevertheless, it worked.", "The administration deserves credit for having made it work.", "It is important for NATO to have it work.", "It's important for NATO to be strong and confident and to help keep the peace in Europe.", "And one of the reasons I felt so strongly that the United States needed to participate was because of our relations with NATO, and NATO is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future.", "Now, there's more work to do.", "Remains to be seen, however, whether or not there's going to be a political settlement in Kosovo, and I certainly hope there is one.", "I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m on record as saying at some point in time I hope our European friends become the peacekeepers in Bosnia and in the Balkans.", "I hope that they put the troops on the ground so that we can withdraw our troops and focus our military on fighting and winning war.", " Well, I've been kind of a hard-liner on this issue for more than eight years.", "When I was in the senate before I became vice president I was pushing for stronger action against Milosevic.", "He caused the death of so many people.", "He was the last communist party boss there and then he became a dictator that by some other label he was still essentially a communist dictator.", "And unfortunately now he is trying to reassert himself in Serbian politics.", "Already just today the members of his political party said that they were going to ignore the orders of the new president of Serbia, and that they question his legitimacy, and he's still going to try to be actively involved.", "He is an indicted war criminal.", "He should be held accountable.", "Now, I did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier, and maybe I have heard, maybe I have heard the previous statements wrong, Governor.", "In some of the discussions we've had about when it's appropriate for the U.S. to use force around the world, at times the standards that you've laid down have given me the impression that if it's something like a genocide taking place or what they called ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, that that alone would not be, that that wouldn't be the kind of situation that would cause you to think that the U.S. ought to get involved with troops.", "Now, have to be other factors involved for me to want to be involved.", "But by itself, that to me can bring into play a fundamental American strategic interest because I think it's based on our values.", "Now, have I got that wrong?", " Trying to figure out who the questioner was.", "If I think it's in our nation's strategic interest I'll commit troops.", "I thought it was in our strategic interests to keep Milosevic in check because of our relations in NATO, and that's why I took the position I took.", "I think it's important for NATO to be strong and confident.", "I felt like unchecked Milosevic would harm NATO, and so it depends on the situation, Mr. Vice President.", " Can you run through the list again?", " I thought that was a mistake.", " I supported that.", " I supported that.", " Yes, I voted for it, supported it.", " Of course, and that again -- no, I think that that was ill-considered.", "I did support it at the time.", "It was in the previous administration, in the Bush-Quayle administration, and I think in retrospect the lessons there are ones that we should take very, very seriously.", " Oh, yes.", " Yes.", " Yes.", " Make a couple comments.", " Started off as a humanitarian mission and it changed into a nation-building mission, and that's where the mission went wrong.", "The mission was changed.", "And as a result, our nation paid a price.", "And so I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called nation-building.", "I think our troops ought to be used to fight and win war.", "I think our troops ought to be used to help overthrow the dictator when it's in our best interests.", "But in this case it was a nation-building exercise, and same with Haiti.", "I wouldn't have supported either.", " Yes.", " Yes.", " Yes.", "Some of them I've got a conflict of interest on, if you know what I mean.", " I think the administration did the right thing in that case.", "I do.", "It was a horrible situation, no one liked to see it on our TV screens, but it's a case where we need to make sure we have an early warning system in place in places where there could be ethnic cleansing and genocide the way we saw it there in Rwanda.", "And that's a case where we need to use our influence to have countries in Africa come together and help deal with the situation.", "The administration, seems like we're having a great love fest tonight, but the administration made the right decision on training Nigerian troops for situations just such as this in Rwanda, and so I thought they made the right decision not to send U.S. troops into Rwanda.", " I'd like to come back to the question of nation building, but let me address the question directly, first.", "Fine.", "We did, actually, send troops into Rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures.", "My wife Tipper, who is here, actually went on a military plane with General Sholicatchvieli on one of those flights.", "But I think in retrospect we were too late getting in there.", "We could have saved more lives if we had acted earlier.", "But I do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason, Jim.", "One of the criteria that I think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military forces.", "If we tried everything else, if we have allies.", "In the Balkans we have allies, NATO, ready, willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden.", "In Africa we did not.", "Now, we have tried -- our country has tried to create an Africa crisis response team there, and we've met some resistance.", "We have had some luck with Nigeria, but in Sierra Leon, and now that Nigeria has become a democracy, and we hope it stays that way, then maybe we can build on that.", "But because we had no allies and because it was very unclear that we could actually accomplish what we would want to accomplish about putting military forces there, I think it was the right thing not to jump in, as heartbreaking as it was, but I think we should have come in much quicker with the humanitarian mission.", " Well, I understand, and Africa is important.", "And we've got to do a lot of work in Africa to promote democracy and trade, and there are some -- Vice President mentioned Nigeria is a fledgling democracy.", "We have to work with Nigeria.", "It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important continent.", "But there's got to be priorities, and Middle East is a priority for a lot of reasons, as is Europe and the Far East, our own hemisphere.", "And those are my four top priorities should I be the president, not to say we won't be engaged nor work hard to get other nations to come together to prevent atrocity.", "I thought the best example of a way to handle the situation was East Timor when we provided logistical support to the Australians, support that only we can provide.", "I thought that was a good model.", "But we can't be all things to all people in the world, Jim.", "And I think that's where maybe the vice president and I begin to have some differences.", "I'm worried about overcommitting our military around the world.", "I want to be judicious in its use.", "You mentioned Haiti.", "I wouldn't have sent troops to Haiti.", "I didn't think it was a mission worthwhile.", "It was a nation building mission, and it was not very successful.", "It cost us billions, a couple billions of dollars, and I'm not so sure democracy is any better off in Haiti than it was before.", " I don't think we agree on that.", "I would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of American troops overseas.", "I think we have to be very reticent about that.", "But look, Jim, the world is changing so rapidly.", "The way I see it, the world is getting much closer together.", "Like it or not, we are now -- the United States is now the natural leader of the world.", "All these other countries are looking to us.", "Now, just because we cannot be involved everywhere, and shouldn't be, doesn't mean that we should shy away from going in anywhere.", "Now, both of us are kind of, I guess, stating the other's position in a maximalist extreme way, but I think there is a difference here.", "This idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century, World War II.", "During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States.", "The lesson was that in the aftermath of World War I, we kind of turned our backs and left them to their own devices and they brewed up a lot of trouble that quickly became World War II.", "And acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did.", "We got intimately involved in building NATO and other structures there.", "We still have lots of troops in Europe.", "And what did we do in the late '40's and '50's and '60's?", "We were nation building.", "And it was economic.", "But it was also military.", "And the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there.", "We had civil administrators come in to set up their ways of building their towns back.", " First let me just say one comment about what the vice president said.", "I think one of the lessons in between World War I and World War II is we let our military atrophy.", "And we can't do that.", "We've got to rebuild our military.", "But one of the problems we have in the military is we're in a lot of places around the world.", "And I mentioned one, and that's the Balkans.", "I would very much like to get our troops out of there.", "I recognize we can't do it now, nor do I advocate an immediate withdrawal.", "That would be an abrogation of our agreement with NATO.", "No one is suggesting that.", "But I think it ought to be one of our priorities to work with our European friends to convince them to put troops on the ground.", "And there is an example.", "Haiti is another example.", "Now there are some places where I think -- you know, I've supported the administration in Columbia.", "I think it's important for us to be training Columbians in that part of the world.", "The hemisphere is in our interest to have a peaceful Columbia.", "But --", " I don't think so.", "I think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations.", "Maybe I'm missing something here.", "I mean, we're going to have kind of a nation building core from America?", "Absolutely not.", "Our military is meant to fight and win war.", "That's what it's meant to do.", "And when it gets overextended, morale drops.", "I strongly believe we need to have a military presence in the Korean peninsula, not only to keep the peace in the peninsula, but to keep regional stability.", "And I strongly believe we need to keep a presence in NATO, but I'm going to be judicious as to how to use the military.", "It needs to be in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear, and the extra strategy obvious.", " I don't disagree with that.", "I certainly don't disagree that we ought to get our troops home from places like the Balkans as soon as we can, as soon as the mission is complete.", "That's what we did in Haiti.", "There are no more than a handful of American military personnel in Haiti now.", "And Haitians have their problems, but we gave them a chance to restore democracy.", "That's really about all we can do.", "But if you have a situation like that right in our backyard with chaos about to break out and flotillas forming to come across the water, and all kinds of violence there, right in one of our neighboring countries there, then I think that we did the right thing there.", "And as for this idea of nation building, the phrase sounds grandiose.", "And, you know, we can't be -- we can't allow ourselves to get overextended.", "I certainly agree with that.", "And that's why I've supported building up our capacity.", "I've devoted in the budget I've proposed, as I said last week, more than twice as much as the governor has proposed.", "I think that it's in better shape now than he generally does.", "We've had some disagreements about that.", "He said that two divisions would have to report not ready for duty, and that's not what the joint chiefs say.", "But there's no doubt that we have to continue building up readiness and military strength.", "And we have to also be very cautious in the way we use our military.", " Well, I mentioned Third World debt.", " That's a place where we can use our generosity to influence in a positive way, influence nations.", "I believe we ought to have foreign aid, but I don't think we ought to just have foreign aid for the sake of foreign aid.", "I think foreign aid needs to be used to encourage markets and reform.", "I think a lot of times we just spend aid and say we feel better about it and it ends up being spent the wrong way, and there's some pretty egregious examples recently.", "One being Russia, where we had IMF loans that ended up in the pockets of a lot of powerful people and didn't help the nation.", "I think the IMF has got a role in the world, but I don't want to see the IMF out there as a way to say to world bankers, if you make a bad loan, we'll bail you out.", "It needs to be available for emergency situations.", "I thought the President did the right thing with Mexico and was very strongly supportive of the administration in Mexico.", "But I don't think the IMF ought to be a stop loss for people who ought to be able to evaluate risks themselves.", "So I'll look at every place where we're investing money.", "I just want to make sure the return is good.", " No, I would make some changes.", "I think there need to be reforms in the IMF.", "I've generally supported it, but I've seen them make some calls that I thought were highly questionable.", "And I think that there's a general agreement in many parts of the world now that there ought to be changes in the IMF.", "The World Bank I think is generally doing a better job, but I think one of the big issues here that doesn't get nearly enough attention is the issue of corruption.", "The governor mentioned it earlier.", "I've worked on this issue.", "It's an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies, like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials, that's one of the worst forms of it.", "And we have got to again lead by example and help these other countries that are trying to straighten out their situations find the tools in order to do it.", "I just think, Jim, that this is an absolutely unique period in world history.", "The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coming together, as I said, they're looking to us.", "And we have a fundamental choice to make.", "Are we going to step up to the plate as a nation the way we did after World War II, the way that generation of heroes said okay, the United States is going to be the leader.", "And the world benefitted tremendously from the courage that they showed in those post-war years.", "I think that in the aftermath of the Cold War, it's time for us to do something very similar, to step up to the plate, to provide the leadership on the environment, leadership to make sure the world economy keeps moving in the right direction.", "Again, that means not running big deficits here and not squandering our surplus.", "It means having intelligent decisions that keep our prosperity going and shepherds that economic strength so that we can provide that leadership role.", " Let me comment on that.", "I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say this is the way it's got to be.", "We can help.", "And maybe it's just our difference in government, the way we view government.", "I want to empower the people.", "I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do.", "I just don't think it's the role of the United States to walk into a country and say, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we do it this way, so should you.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d I think we can help.", "I know we've got to encourage democracy in the marketplaces.", "But take Russia, for example.", "We went into Russia, we said here is some IMF money, and it ended up in Viktor Chemomyrdin's pocket, and others, and yet we played like there was reform.", "The only people that are going to reform Russia are Russia.", "They're going to have to make the decision themselves.", "Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and/or entities invest capital, there's a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy.", "But Russia has to make the decision.", "We can work with them on security matters, for example, but it's their call to make.", "So I'm not exactly sure where the vice president is coming from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we do it this way, so should you.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Now, we trust freedom.", "We know freedom is a powerful, powerful, powerful force, much bigger than the United States of America, as we saw recently in the Balkans.", "But maybe I misunderstand where you're coming from, Mr. Vice President, but I think the United States must be humble and must be proud and confident of our values, but humble in how we treat nations that are figuring out how to chart their own course.", " Far be it from me to suggest otherwise.", "(LAUGHTER)", " Yes, I would.", "The only thing an executive order can accomplish is to ban it in federal law enforcement agencies, but I would also support a law in the Congress that would have the effect of doing the same thing.", "I just -- I think that racial profiling is a serious problem.", "I remember when the stories first came out about the stops in New Jersey by the highway patrol there.", "And I know it's been going on a long time.", "In some ways this is just a new label for something that has been going on for years.", "But I have to confess that it was the first time that I really focused on it in a new way.", "And I was surprised at the extent of it.", "And I think we've now got so many examples around the country that we really have to find ways to end this.", "Imagine what it -- what it is like for someone to be singled out unfairly, unjustly, and feel the unfair force of law simply because of race or ethnicity.", "Now, that runs counter to what the United States of America is all about at our core.", "And it's not an easy problem to solve.", "But if I am entrusted with the presidency, it will be the first Civil Rights Act of the 21st century.", " Yeah, I can't imagine what it would be like to be singled out because of race and stopped and harassed.", "That's just flat wrong, and that's not what America is all about.", "And so we ought to do everything we can to end racial profiling.", "One of my concerns, though, is I don't want to federalize the local police forces.", "I want to -- obviously in the egregious cases we need to enforce civil rights law, but we need to make sure that internal affairs divisions at the local level do their job and be given a chance to do their job.", "I believe in local control of governments, and obviously if they don't there needs to be a consequence at the federal level.", "But it's very important that we not overstep our bounds and I think most people -- most police officers are good, dedicated, honorable citizens who are doing their job, putting their lives at risk who aren't bigoted or aren't prejudiced.", "I don't think they ought to be held guilty.", "But I do think we need to find out where racial profiling occurs and do something about it and say to the local folks, get it done.", "And if you can't, there will be a federal consequence.", " Yeah.", " I would agree.", "And I also agree that most police officers, of course, are doing a good job and hate this practice also.", "I talked to an African-American police officer in Springfield, Massachusetts not long ago who raised this question and said that in his opinion one of the biggest solutions is in the training.", "And not only the training in police procedures, but human relations.", "And I think that racial profiling is part of a larger issue of how we deal with race in America.", "And as for singling people out because of race, you know, James Byrd was singled out because of his race in Texas.", "And other Americans have been singled out because of their race or ethnicity.", "And that's why I think we can embody our values by passing a hate crimes law.", "I think these crimes are different.", "I think they're different because they're based on prejudice and hatred, which gives rise to crimes that have not just a single victim, but they're intended to stigmatize and dehumanize a whole group of people.", " No, I don't, really.", " No.", "We've got one in Texas.", "And guess what?", "The three men who murdered James Byrd, guess what's going to happen to them?", "They're going to be put to death.", "A jury found them guilty.", "It's going to be hard to punish them any worse after they get put to death.", "And it's the right cause.", "It's the right decision.", "Secondly, there is other forms of racial profiling that goes on in America.", "Arab-Americans are racially profiled in what is called secret evidence.", "People are stopped, and we have to do something about that.", "My friend, Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, is pushing a law to make sure that Arab-Americans are treated with respect.", "So racial profiling isn't just an issue at local police forces.", "It's an issue throughout our society.", "And as we become a diverse society, we're going to have to deal with it more and more.", "I believe, though -- I believe, as sure as I'm sitting here, that most Americans really care.", "They're tolerant people.", "They're good, tolerant people.", "It's the very few that create most of the crises, and we just have to find them and deal with them.", " Let me tell you where the biggest discrimination comes.", "In public education when we just move children through the schools.", "My friend, Phyllis Hunter, is here.", "She had one of the greatest lines of all lines.", "She said, reading is the new civil right.", "She's right.", "And to make sure our society is as hopeful as it possibly can be, every single child in America must be educated.", "I mean every child.", "It starts with making sure every child learns to read.", "K-2 diagnostic testing so we know whether or not there's a deficiency.", "Curriculum that works and phonics needs to be an integral part of our reading curriculum.", "Intensive reading laboratories, teacher retraining.", "I mean, there needs to be a wholesale effort against racial profiling, which is illiterate children.", "We can do better in our public schools.", "We can close an achievement gap, and it starts with making sure we have strong accountability, Jim.", "One of the cornerstones of reform, and good reform, is to measure.", "Because when you measure you can ask the question, do they know?", "Is anybody being profiled?", "Is anybody being discriminated against?", "It becomes a tool, a corrective tool.", "And I believe the federal government must say that if you receive any money, any money from the federal government for disadvantaged children, for example, you must show us whether or not the children are learning.", "And if they are, fine.", "And if they're not, there has to be a consequence.", "And so to make sure we end up getting rid of basic structural prejudice is education.", "There is nothing more prejudiced than not educating a child.", " Well, I think we need tough enforcement of the civil rights laws.", "I think we still need affirmative action.", "I would pass a hate crimes law, as I said, and I guess I had misunderstood the governor's previous position.", "The Byrd family may have a misunderstanding of it in Texas also.", "But I would like to shift, if I could, to the big issue of education.", " Well, I had thought that there was a controversy at the end of the legislative session where the hate crimes law in Texas was -- failed, and that the Byrd family, among others, asked you to support it, Governor, and it died in committee for lack of support.", "Am I wrong about that?", " Well, you don't realize we have a hate crimes statute?", "We do.", " I'm talking about the one that was proposed to deal --", " No -- well, what the Vice President must not understand is we've got a hate crimes bill in Texas.", "And secondly, the people that murdered Mr. Byrd got the ultimate punishment.", "The death penalty.", " In this case when you murder somebody it's hate, Jim.", "The crime is hate.", "And they got the ultimate punishment.", "I'm not exactly sure how you enhance the penalty any more than the death penalty.", "We happen to have a statute on the books that's a hate crimes statute in Texas.", " May I respond?", " I don't want to jump in.", "I may have been misled by all the news reports about this matter, because the law that was proposed in Texas that had the support of the Byrd family and a whole lot of people in Texas did, in fact, die in committee.", "There may be some other statute that was already on the books, but certainly the advocates of the hate crimes law felt that a tough new law was needed.", "And it's important, Jim, not only -- not just because of Texas, but because this mirrors the national controversy.", "There is pending now in the Congress a national hate crimes law because of James Byrd, because of Matthew Shepard, who was crucified on a split rail fence by bigots, and because of others.", "And that law has died in committee also because of the same kind of opposition.", " Absolutely.", " I would support the Orrin Hatch version of it, not the Senator Kennedy version.", "But let me say to you, Mr. Vice President, we're happy with our laws on our books.", "That bill did -- there was another bill that did die in committee.", "But I want to repeat, if you have a state that fully supports the law like we do in Texas, we're going to go after all crime.", "And we're going to make sure people get punished for the crime.", "And in this case we can't enhance the penalty any more than putting those three thugs to death.", "And that's what's gonna happen in the State of Texas.", " I'm not for gay marriage.", "I think marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman.", "And I appreciated the way the administration signed the Defense of Marriage Act.", "I presume the Vice President supported it when the President signed that bill and supports it now.", "But I think marriage is a sacred institution.", "I'm going to be respectful for people who may disagree with me.", "I've had a record of doing so in the State of Texas.", "I've been a person that had been called a uniter, not a divider, because I accept other people's points of view.", "But I feel strongly that marriage should be between a man and a woman.", " I agree with that, and I did support that law.", "But I think that we should find a way to allow some kind of civic unions, and I basically agree with Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman.", "And I think the three of us have one view and the Governor has another view.", " I'm not sure what kind of view he's describing to me.", "I can just tell you, I'm a person who respects other people.", "I respect their -- I respect -- on the one hand he says he agrees with me and then he says he doesn't.", "I'm not sure where he's coming from.", "But I will be a tolerant person.", "I've been a tolerant person all my life.", "I just happen to believe strongly that marriage is between a man and a woman.", " Yes.", "I don't think they ought to have special rights, but I think they ought to have the same rights.", " Well, there's a law pending called the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.", "I strongly support it.", "What it says is that gays and lesbians can't be fired from their job because they're gay or lesbian.", "And it would be a federal law preventing that.", "Now, I wonder if the -- it's been blocked by the opponents in the majority in the Congress.", "I wonder if the Governor would lend his support to that law.", " The question --", " Well, I have no idea.", "I mean, he can throw out all kinds -- I don't know the particulars of this law.", "I will tell you I'm the kind of person, I don't hire or fire somebody based upon their sexual orientation.", "As a matter of fact, I would like to take the issue a little further.", "I don't really think it's any of my -- you know, any of my concerns what -- how you conduct your sex life.", "And I think that's a private matter.", "And I think that's the way it ought to be.", "But I'm going to be respectful for people, I'll tolerate people, and I support equal rights but not special rights for people.", " Well, it would be if they're given special protective status.", "That doesn't mean we shouldn't fully enforce laws and fully protect people and fully honor people, which I will do as the President of the United States.", " Jim, I hope that we can come back to the subject of education because the governor made an extensive statement on it and I have a very different view than the one he expressed.", "But that having been said, I believe that -- well, first of all, let me say that the governor and I agree on some things where this subject is concerned.", "I will not do anything to affect the rights of hunters or sportsmen.", "I think that homeowners have to be respected and their right to have a gun if they wish to.", "The problem I see is that there are too many guns getting into the hands of children, and criminals, and people who, for whatever reason, some kind of history of stalking or domestic abuse really should not be able to get guns.", "I think these assault weapons are a problem.", "So I favor closing the gun show loophole.", "In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to close it, but then the majority in the House of Representatives went the other way.", "That's still pending.", "If we could get agreement on that, maybe they could pass that in the final days of this Congress.", "I think we ought to restore the three-day waiting period under the Brady Law.", "I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively.", "Some of the restrictions that have been placed by the Congress in the last couple of years.", "I think -- in the last few years I think have been unfortunate.", "I think that we ought to make all schools gun free.", "Have a gun-free zone around every school in this country.", "I think that measures like these are important.", "Child safety trigger locks on a mandatory basis, and others.", " Well, it starts with enforcing law.", "When you say loud and clear to somebody if you're going to carry a gun illegally, we're going to arrest you.", "If you're going to sell a gun illegally, you need to be arrested.", "If you commit a crime with a gun, there needs to be absolute certainty in the law.", "And that means that the local law enforcement officials need help at the federal level.", "Programs like Project Exile where the federal government intensifies arresting people who illegally use guns.", "And we haven't done a very good job of that at the federal level recently.", "And I'm going to make it a priority.", "Secondly, I don't think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldn't have them.", "That's why I support instant background checks at gun shows.", "One of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not.", "In Texas I tried to do something innovative.", "There's a lot of talk about trigger locks being on guns sold in the future.", "I support that.", "But I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come and get one for free.", "So we're distributing in our State of Texas for free.", "I think we ought to raise the age at which a juvenile can carry a handgun from 18 to 21.", "I disagree with the vice president on this issue.", "He is for registration of guns.", "I think the only people that are going to show up to register or get a license -- I guess licensing like a driver's license for a gun, the only people that are going to show up are law-abiding citizens.", "The criminal is not going to show up and say hey, give me my I.D.", "card.", "It's the law-abiding citizens who will do that.", "An I don't think that is going to be an effective tool to make the -- keep our society safe.", " Well, I'm not for registration.", "I am for licensing by states of new handgun purchases.", " A photo license I.D.", "like a driver's license for new handguns and, you know, the Los Angeles --", " Correct.", " The state.", "The state.", "I think states should do that for new handguns, because too many criminals are getting guns.", "There was a recent investigation of the number in Texas who got -- who were given concealed weapons permits in spite of the fact that they had records.", "And the \"Los Angeles Times\" spent a lot of ink going into that.", "But I am not for doing anything that would affect hunters or sportsmen, rifles, shotguns, existing handguns.", "I do think that sensible gun safety measures are warranted now.", "Look, this is the year -- this is in the aftermath of Columbine, and Paducah, and all the places in our country where the nation has been shocked by these weapons in the hands of the wrong people.", "The woman who bought the guns for the two boys who did that killing at Columbine said that if she had had to give her name and fill out a form there, she would not have bought those guns.", "That conceivably could have prevented that tragedy.", " Well, I'm not for photo licensing.", "Let me say something about Columbine.", "Listen, we've got gun laws.", "He says we ought to have gun-free schools.", "Everybody believes that.", "I'm sure every state in the union has got them.", "You can't carry a gun into a school.", "And there ought to be a consequence when you do carry a gun into a school.", "But Columbine spoke to a larger issue.", "It's really a matter of culture.", "It's a culture that somewhere along the line we've begun to disrespect life.", "Where a child can walk in and have their heart turned dark as a result of being on the Internet and walk in and decide to take somebody else's life?", "So gun laws are important, no question about it, but so is loving children, and character education classes, and faith-based programs being a part of after-school programs.", "Some desperate child needs to have somebody put their arm around them and say, we love you.", "So there's a -- this is a society that -- of ours that's got to do a better job of teaching children right from wrong.", "And we can enforce law.", "But there seems to be a lot of preoccupation on -- not certainly only in this debate, but just in general on law.", "But there's a larger law.", "Love your neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself.", "And that's where our society must head if we're going to be a peaceful and prosperous society.", " I also believe in the Golden Rule.", "And I agree with a lot of the other things that the governor has said.", "We do have a serious problem in our culture.", "Tipper and I have worked on the problem of violence in entertainment aimed at children.", "She's worked on it longer than I have.", "But I feel very strongly about that.", "And if I'm elected president, I will do something about that.", "But I think that we -- I think we have to start with better parenting.", "But I don't think that we can ignore the role played by guns.", "I mean, the fact is that there -- even though no state wants them, there are guns in some schools.", "And the reason it's so difficult for schools to control that is because in recent years there has been a flood of cheap handguns that are so widely available that kids are finding ways to get ahold of them.", "And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands.", " Yeah, no question about that, but there also needs to be strong enforcement of the law.", "Some kid who feels like -- doesn't matter where the gun comes from, it could be a cheap gun, expensive gun.", "What matters is something in this person's head says there is not going to be a consequence.", "So in my state we toughen up the juvenile justice laws.", "We added beds.", "We're tough.", "We believe in tough love.", "We say, if you get caught carrying a gun, you're automatically detained.", "And that's what needs to happen.", "We've got laws.", "If laws need to be strengthened, like instant background checks, that's important.", " Well, I've got a plan to do something about that.", "It's to make health care affordable and available this way.", "First, there's some who should be buying health care who choose not to.", "There's some --", " Some of the healthy folks, healthy young kids say I'll never get sick, therefore I don't need health care right now.", "For those what I think we need to do is to develop an investment-type vehicle that would be an incentive for them to invest, like medical savings accounts with rollover capacity.", "In other words, you say to a youngster, it will be in your financial interest to start saving for future illness, but for the working folks that do want to have health care that can't afford it, a couple of things we need to do.", "One, we need more community health centers.", "I've developed -- put out money in my budget to expand community health centers all around the country.", "These are places where people can get primary care.", "Secondly -- and they're good.", "They're very important parts of the safety net of health care.", "Secondly, that you get a $2,000 rebate from the government if you're a family of $30,000 or less -- it scales down as you get higher -- that you can use to purchase health care in the private markets.", "It will be a huge down payment for a pretty darn good system.", "If you allow -- also allow -- convince states to -- allow states to allow the mother to match some of the children's health insurance money with it, the pool purchasing power.", "And to make health care more affordable, allow business associations like the National Federal of Independent Business or the Chamber of Commerce or the National Restaurant Association to write association plans across jurisdictional lines so that small businesses have got the capacity to have national pooling to drive the cost of insurance down.", "I think that's the very best way to go.", "It empowers people, it trusts people, it makes -- and it's a practical way to encourage people to purchase health care insurance.", " It's one of my top priorities, Jim, to give every single child in the United States affordable health care within the next four years.", "I would like to see eventually in this country some form of universal health care, but I'm not for a government-run system.", "In fact, I'm for shrinking the size of government.", "I want a smaller and smarter government.", "I have been in charge of this reinventing government streamlining project that's reduced the size of government by more than 300,000 people in the last several years.", "And the budget plan that I've put out, according to the \"Los Angeles Times\" again, the way these things are typically measured as a percentage of the GDP, will bring government spending down to the lowest level in 50 years.", "So I want to proceed carefully to cover more people.", "But I think we should start by greatly expanding the so-called child health insurance or CHIP program to give health insurance to every single child in this country.", "I think it's intolerable that we have so many millions of children without any health insurance.", "So it's one of my top priorities.", "Now, I know that we have some disagreements on this.", "And I'm sorry to tell you that, you know, there is a record here.", "And Texas ranks 49th out of the 50 states in health care -- in children with health care.", "49th for women with health care, and 50th for families with health care.", "So it is a priority for me.", "I guarantee you.", "I'm not aware of any program -- well, I'll just leave it at that.", "I think it ought to be a top priority.", " First of all, let me say he's not for a government-run health care system?", "I thought that's exactly what he and Mrs. Clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a government-run health care system.", "It was fortunately stopped in its tracks.", "Secondly, we spend $4.7 billion a year on the uninsured in the State of Texas.", "Our rate of uninsured, the percentage of uninsured in Texas has gone down, while the percentage of uninsured in America has gone up.", "Our CHIPS program got a late start because our government meets only four months out of every two years, Mr. Vice President.", "It may come as a shock for somebody who has been in Washington for so long.", "But actually limited government can work in the second largest state in the union.", "And therefore Congress passes the bill after our session in 1997 ended, we passed an enabling legislation in 1999.", "We've signed up over 110,000 children to the CHIPS program.", "For comparable states our size, we're signing them up as fast as any other state.", "You can quote all the numbers you want, but I'm telling you we care about our people in Texas.", "We spent a lot of money to make sure people get health care in the State of Texas, and we're doing a better job than they are at the national level for reducing uninsured.", " Well, I don't know about all these percentages that he throws out, but I do know that -- I speculate that the reason why he didn't answer your question directly as to whether my numbers were right, the facts were right about Texas ranking dead last in families with health insurance and 49th out of 50 for both children and women, is because those facts are correct.", "And as for why it happened, I'm no expert on the Texas procedures, but what my friends there tell me is that the governor opposed a measure put forward by Democrats in the legislature to expand the number of children that would be covered.", "And instead directed the money toward a tax cut, a significant part of which went to wealthy interests.", "He declared the need for a new tax cut for the oil companies in Texas an emergency need, and so the money was taken away from the CHIP program.", "There's -- you don't have to take my word for this.", "There is now a federal judge's opinion about the current management of this program ordering the State of Texas to do -- you should read that judge's language about this.", "I believe there are 1.4 million children in Texas who do not have health insurance.", "600,000 of whom, and maybe some of those have since gotten it, but as of a year ago 600,000 of them were actually eligible for it but they couldn't sign up for it because of the barriers that they had set up.", " If he's trying to allege that I'm a hard-hearted person and I don't care about children, he's absolutely wrong.", "We've spent $4.7 billion a year in the State of Texas for uninsured people.", "And they get health care.", "Now, it's not the most efficient way to get people health care.", "But I want to remind you, the number of uninsured in America during their watch has increased.", "He can make any excuse he wants, but the facts are that we're reducing the number of uninsured percentage of our population.", "And as the percentage of the population is increasing nationally, somehow the allegation that we don't care and we're going to give money for this interest or that interest and not for children in the State of Texas is totally absurd.", "Let me just tell you who the jury is.", "The people of Texas.", "There's only been one governor ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms, and that was me.", "And I was able to do so with a lot of Democrat votes, nearly 50% of the Hispanic vote, about 27% of the African-American vote, because people know I'm a conservative person and a compassionate person.", "So he can throw all the kinds of numbers around.", "I'm just telling you our state comes together to do what is right.", "We come together both Republicans and Democrats.", " Yes, yes.", "But it's not a statement about his heart.", "I don't claim to know his heart.", "I think he's a good person.", "I make no allegations about that.", "I believe him when he says that he has a good heart.", "I know enough about your story to admire a lot of the things that you have done as a person.", "But I think it's about his priorities.", "And let me tell you exactly why I think that the choice he made to give a tax cut for the oil companies and others before addressing this -- I mean, if you were the governor of a state that was dead last in health care for families, and all of a sudden you found yourself with the biggest surplus your state had ever had in its history, wouldn't you want to maybe use some of it to climb from 50th to, say, 45 or 40 or something or maybe better?", "I would.", "Now, but here is why it's directly relevant, Jim.", "Because by his own budget numbers, his proposals for spending on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy are more than the new spending proposals that he has made for health care and education and national defense all combined.", "According to his own numbers.", "So it's not a question of his heart, as far as I know.", "It's a question of priorities and values.", "See, you know --", " First of all, that's simply not true what he just said, of course.", "And secondly, I repeat to you --", " That we spent -- the top 1% receive 223 as opposed to 445 billion in new spending.", "The top -- let's talk about my tax plan.", "The top 1% will pay one-third of all the federal income taxes.", "And in return, get one-fifth of the benefits, because most of the tax reductions go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.", "That stands in stark contrast, by the way, to a man who is going to leave 50 million -- 50 million Americans out of tax relief.", "We just have a different point of view.", "It's a totally different point of view.", "He believes only the right people ought to get tax relief.", "I believe everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief.", "Let me go back to Texas, for example, for a minute.", "We pay 4.7 billion.", "I can't emphasize to you how much.", "I signed a bill that puts CHIPS in place.", "The bill finally came out at the end of the 1999 session.", "We're working hard to sign up children.", "We're doing it faster than any other state our size, comparable state.", "We're making really good progress.", "And our state cares a lot about our children.", "My priority is going to be the health of our citizens.", "These folks have had eight years to get something done in Washington, D.C. on the uninsured.", "They have not done it.", "They've had eight years to get something done on Medicare.", "And they have not got it done.", "And my case to the American people is, if you're happy with inactivity, stay with the horse.", "The horse is up here now.", "But if you want change, you need to get somebody that knows how to bring Republicans and Democrats together to get positive things done for America.", " I do.", "I think that in this 21st century we will soon see the consequences of what's called global warming.", "There was a study just a few weeks ago suggesting that in summertime the north polar ice cap will be completely gone in 50 years.", "Already many people see the strange weather conditions that the old timers say they've never seen before in their lifetimes.", "And what's happening is the level of pollution is increasing significantly.", "Now, here is the good news, Jim.", "If we take the leadership role and build the new technologies, like the new kinds of cars and trucks that Detroit is itching to build, then we can create millions of good new jobs by being first into the market with these new kinds of cars and trucks and other kinds of technologies.", "You know the Japanese are breathing down our necks on this.", "They're moving very rapidly because they know that it is a fast-growing world market.", "Some of these other countries, particularly in the developing world, their pollution is much worse than anywhere else and their people want higher standards of living.", "And so they're looking for ways to satisfy their desire for a better life and still reduce pollution at the same time.", "I think that holding onto the old ways and the old argument that the environment and the economy are in conflict is really outdated.", "We have to be bold.", "We have to provide leadership.", "Now it's true that we disagree on this.", "The governor said that he doesn't think this problem is necessarily caused by people.", "He's for letting the oil companies into the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.", "Houston has just become the smoggiest city in the country.", "And Texas is number one in industrial pollution.", "We have a very different outlook.", "And I'll tell you this, I will fight for a clean environment in ways that strengthen our economy.", " Well, let me start with Texas.", "We are a big industrial state.", "We reduced our industrial waste by 11%.", "We cleaned up more brown fields than any other administration in my state's history, 450 of them.", "Our water is cleaner now.", " A brown field is an abandoned industrial site that just sits idle in some of our urban centers.", "And people are willing to invest capital in the brown fields don't want to do so for fear of lawsuit.", "I think we ought to have federal liability protection, depending upon whether or not standards have been met.", "The book you mentioned that Vice President Gore wrote, he also called for taxing -- big energy taxes in order to clean up the environment.", "And now that the energy prices are high, I guess he's not advocating those big energy taxes right now.", "I believe we ought to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund to -- with half the money going to states so states can make the right decisions for environmental quality.", "I think we need to have clean coal technologies.", "I propose $2 billion worth.", "By the way, I just found out the other day an interesting fact, that there is a national petroleum reserve right next to -- in Prudhoe Bay that your administration opened up for exploration in that pristine area.", "And it was a smart move because there's gas reserves up there.", "We need gas pipelines to bring the gas down.", "Gas is a clean fuel that we can burn to -- we need to make sure that if we decontrol our plants that there's mandatory -- that the plants must conform to clean air standards, the grandfathered plants, that's what we did in Texas.", "No excuses.", "You must conform.", "In other words, there are practical things we can do.", "But it starts with working in a collaborative effort with states and local folks.", "If you own the land, every day is Earth Day.", "People care a lot about their land and care about their environment.", "Not all wisdom is in Washington, D.C. on this issue.", " I'm really strongly committed to clean water and clean air, and cleaning up the new kinds of challenges like global warming.", "He is right that I'm not in favor of energy taxes.", "I am in favor of tax cuts to encourage and give incentives for the quicker development of these new kinds of technologies.", "And let me say again, Detroit is rearing to go on that.", "We differ on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as I have said.", "We differ on whether or not pollution controls ought to be voluntary.", "I don't think you can -- I don't think you can get results that way.", "We differ on the kinds of appointments that we would make.", " I think it's a fundamental difference.", "Let me give you an example.", " Okay, sure.", " Well, I don't believe in command and control out of Washington, D.C.", "I believe Washington ought to set standards, but again I think we ought to be collaborative at the local levels and I think we ought to work with people at the local levels.", "And by the way, I just want to make sure -- I can't let him just say something and not correct it.", "The electric decontrol bill that I fought for and signed in Texas has mandatory emission standards, Mr. Vice President.", "That's what we ought to do at the federal level when it comes to grandfathered plants for utilities.", "I think there's a difference.", "I think, for example, take -- when they took 40 million acres of land out of circulation without consulting local officials, I thought that was --", " Out in the west, yeah.", "And so -- on the logging issue.", "That's not the way I would have done it.", "Perhaps some of that land needs to be set aside.", "But I certainly would have consulted with governors and elected officials before I would have acted unilaterally.", " Sure, absolutely, so long as they're based upon science and they're reasonable.", "So long as people have input.", " I think it's an issue that we need to take very seriously.", "But I don't think we know the solution to global warming yet.", "And I don't think we've got all the facts before we make decisions.", "I tell you one thing I'm not going to do is I'm not going to let the United States carry the burden for cleaning up the world's air.", "Like Kyoto Treaty would have done.", "China and India were exempted from that treaty.", "I think we need to be more even-handed, as evidently 99 senators -- I think it was 99 senators supported that position.", " 99 to nothing.", " Well, that vote wasn't exactly -- a lot of the supporters of the Kyoto Treaty actually ended up voting for that because the way it was worded.", "But there's no doubt there's a lot of opposition to it in the Senate.", "I'm not for command and control techniques either.", "I'm for working with the groups, not just with industry but also with the citizen groups and local communities to control sprawl in ways that the local communities themselves come up with.", "But I disagree that we don't know the cause of global warming.", "I think that we do.", "It's pollution, carbon dioxide, and other chemicals that are even more potent, but in smaller quantities, that cause this.", "Look, the world's temperature is going up, weather patterns are changing, storms are getting more violent and unpredictable.", "What are we going to tell our children?", "I'm a grandfather now.", "I want to be able to tell my grandson when I'm in my later years that I didn't turn away from the evidence that showed that we were doing some serious harm.", "In my faith tradition, it is -- it's written in the book of Matthew, \"Where your heart is, there is your treasure also.\"", "And I believe that -- that we ought to recognize the value to our children and grandchildren of taking steps that preserve the environment in a way that's good for them.", " Yeah, I agree.", "I just -- I think there has been -- some of the scientists, I believe, Mr. Vice President, haven't they been changing their opinion a little bit on global warming?", "A profound scientist recently made a different --", " I've been trying so hard not to.", " Twice.", " That's an interruption, by the way.", " I'm sorry.", "I apologize, Mr. Vice President.", " Of course they care about them.", "Oh, you mean the rules.", " What the heck.", "I -- of course there's a lot -- look, global warming needs to be taken very seriously, and I take it seriously.", "But science, there's a lot -- there's differing opinions.", "And before we react, I think it's best to have the full accounting, full understanding of what's taking place.", "And I think to answer your question, I think both of us care a lot about the environment.", "We may have different approaches.", "We may have different approaches in terms of how we deal with local folks.", "I just cited an example of the administration just unilaterally acting without any input.", "And I remember you gave a very good answer to New Hampshire about the White Mountains, about how it was important to keep that collaborative effort in place.", "I feel

think this is an issue.", "I found it to be an issue in trying to defend my tax relief package.", "I thought there was some exaggerations about the numbers.", "But the people are going to have to make up their mind on this issue.", "And I am going to continue to defend my record and defend my propositions against what I think are exaggerations.", "Exaggerations like, for example, only 5% of seniors receive benefits under my Medicare reform package.", "That's what he said the other day, and that's simply not the case.", "And I have every right in the world to defend my record and positions.",

to try to do better.", "One of the reasons I regret it is that getting a detail wrong interfered several times with the point that I was trying to make.", "However many days that young girl in Florida

are seniors who pay more for their prescriptions than a lot of other people, more than their pets, sometimes.", "More sometimes than people in foreign countries.", "And we need to do something about that.", "Not with the measure that leaves the majority of them without any real basic help until the next president's term of four years is over.", "But right away.", "And that means doing it under the Medicare program.", "I can't promise that I will never get another detail wrong.", "I can promise you that I will try not to, and hard.", "But I will promise you this with all the confidence in my heart and in the world, that I will do my best if I'm elected president, I'll work my heart out to get the big things right for the American people.", " That's going to be up to the people, isn't it?", " Depends on what he says in the future in the campaign.", " I hope they're not awful things.", "I think they may be using the man's own words.", " I don't believe I've used those words.", " Maybe they have.", " Wait a minute.", "(LAUGHTER)", " I don't use language like that and I don't think that we should.", " I understand.", "The -- I haven't seen that, in my commercials?", " You haven't seen the commercial?", " I think that what -- I think the point of that is that anybody would have a hard time trying to make a tax cut plan that is so large, that would put us into such big deficits, that gives almost half the benefits to the wealthiest of the wealthy.", "I think anybody would have a hard time explaining that clearly in a way that makes sense to the average person.", " That's the kind of exaggeration I was just talking about.", "(LAUGHTER)", " Well, I wasn't the one having trouble explaining it.", " Jim, one of the issues that I would like to close with in my statement is education, because it's an example of the overall approach that I think is important.", "This race is about values, it's about change, it's about giving choices to the American people.",

accountability, testing of students.", "I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also.", "The difference is that while my plan starts with new accountability and maintains local control, it doesn't stop there.", "Because I want to give new choices to parents.",

students can get more one-on-one time with teachers.", "And the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers.", "I've a plan in my budget to recruit 100,000 new, highly qualified teachers and to help local school districts build new schools.", "I think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and pre-school.", "Now, here is how that connects with all the rest of what we've been talking about.", "If you have -- if you squander the surplus on a huge tax cut that goes mostly to those at the top, then you can't make education the top priority.", "If the tax cut is your number

relief for all people who pay the bills in America, because I think you can spend your money more wisely than the federal government can.", "Thank you for listening.", "I'm asking for your vote, and God bless.", " No.", "There are many people who believe that the only way we can get this country turned around is to tax the middle class more and punish them more, but the truth is that middle-class

taxed much less, even though their incomes have gone up.", "Middle-class people will have their fair share of changing to do, and many challenges to face, including the challenge of becoming constantly re-educated.", "But my plan is a departure from trickle-down economics, just cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans and getting out of the way.", "It's also a departure from tax-and- spend economics, because you can't tax and divide an economy that isn't growing.", "I propose an American version of what works in other countries -- I think we can do it better: invest and grow.", "I believe we can increase investment and reduce the deficit at the same time, if we not only ask the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their share; we also provide over $100 billion in tax relief, in terms of incentives for new plants, new small businesses, new technologies, new housing, and for middle class families; and we have $140 billion of spending cuts.", "Invest and grow.", "Raise some more money, spend the money on tax incentives to have growth in the private sector, take the money from the defense cuts and reinvest it in new transportation and communications

economics will work.", "Unemployment is up.", "Most people are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago.", "I think we can do better if we have the courage to change.", " Do I have 1 minute?", "Just the ground rules here.", " Well, he doesn't like trickle down government but I think he's talking about the Reagan-Bush years where we created 15 million jobs.", "The rich are paying a bigger percent of the total tax burden.", "And what I don't like is trickle down government.", "And therein, I think Governor Clinton keeps talking about trickle down, trickle down, and he's still talking about spending more and taxing more.", "Government -- he says invest government, grow government.", "Government doesn't create jobs.", "If they do, they're make-work jobs.", "It's the private sector that creates jobs.", "And yes, we've got too many taxes on the American people and we're spending too much.", "And that's why I want to get the deficit down by controlling the growth of mandatory spending.", "It won't be painless.", "I think Mr. Perot put his finger on something there.", "It won't be painless but we've got to get the job done.", "But not by raising taxes.", "Mr. and

going to pay for all the spending programs he proposes.", "So we have a big difference on this trickle down theory.", "I do not want any more trickle down government.", "It's gotten too big.", "I want to do something about that.", " The basic problem with it, it doesn't balance the budget.", "If you forecast it out, we still have a significant deficit under each of their plans, as I understand them.", "Our challenge is to stop the financial bleeding.", "If you take a patient into the hospital that's bleeding arterially, step one is to stop the bleeding.", "And we are bleeding arterially.", "There's only one way out of this, and that is to stop the deterioration of our job base, to have a growing, expanding job base, to give us the tax base -- see, balancing the budget is not nearly as difficult as paying off the $4 trillion debt and leaving our children the American dream intact.", "We have spent their money.", "We've got to pay it back.", "This is going to take fair, shared sacrifice.", "My plan balances the budget within 6 years.", "We didn't do it faster than that because we didn't want to disrupt the economy.", "We gave it off to a slow start and a fast finish to give the economy time to recover.", "But we faced it and we did it, and we believe it's fair, shared sacrifice.", "The one thing I have done is lay it squarely on the table in front of the American people.", "You've had a number of occasions to see in detail what the plan is, and at least you'll understand it.", "I think that's fundamental in our country, that you know what you're getting into.", " I disagree with both of them.", "For one thing, let me just follow up here.", "I disagree with Mr. Perot that the answer is to raise -- put a 50-cent gas tax on the middle class and raise more taxes on the middle class and the working poor than on the wealthy.", "His own analysis says that unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 under his plan than it is today.", "And as far as what Mr. Bush says, he is the person who raised taxes on the middle class after saying he wouldn't.", "And just this year, Mr. Bush vetoed a tax increase on the wealthy that gave middle class tax relief.", "He vetoed middle class tax relief this year.", "And furthermore, under this administration, spending has increased more than it has in the last 20 years and he asked Congress to spend more money than it actually spent.", "Now, it's hard to out-spend Congress but he tried to for the last 3 years.", "So my view is the middle class is the -- they've been suffering, Jim.", "Now, should people pay more for Medicare if they can?", "Yes.", "Should they pay more for Social Security if they get more out of it than they paid in, they're upper income people?", "Yes.", "But look what's happened to the middle class.", "Middle class Americans are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago and they're paying higher taxes.", "The tax burden on them has not gone down.", "It has gone up.", "I don't think the answer is to slow the economy down more, drive unemployment up more and undermine the health of the private sector.", "The answer is to invest and grow this economy.", "That's what works in other countries and that's what'll work here.", " I think everybody's paying too much taxes.", "He refers to one tax increase.", "Let me remind you it was a Democratic tax increase, and I didn't want to do it and I went along with it.", "And I said I make a mistake.", "If I make a mistake, I admit it.", "That's quite different than some.", "But I think that's the American way.", "I think everyone's paying too much, but I think this idea that you can go out and -- then he hits me for vetoing a tax bill.", "Yes, I did.", "And the American taxpayer ought to be glad they have a president to stand up to a spending Congress.", "We remember what it was like when we had a spending president and a spending Congress, and interest rates -- who remembers that?", "They were at 21.5% under Jimmy Carter, and inflation was 15.", "We don't want to go back to that.", "And so yes, everybody's taxed too much and I want to get the taxes down, but not by signing a tax bill that's gonna raise taxes on people.", " Well, the record in Arkansas.", "I mean, look at it, and that's what we're asking America to have?", "Now look, he says Arkansas's a poor state.", "They are.", "But in almost every category they're lagging.", "I'll give you an example.", "He talks about all the jobs he's created in one or 2 years.", "Over the last ten years since he's been governor, they're 30% behind, 30% -- they're 30% of the national average.", "On pay for teachers, on all these categories, Arkansas is right near the very bottom.", "You haven't heard me mention this before, but we're getting close now and I think it's about time I start putting things in perspective.", "And I'm going to do that.", "It's not dirty campaigning because he's been talking about my record for a half a year here, 11 months here.", "So we've got to do that.", "I gotta get it in perspective.", "What's his mistake?", "Admit it, that Arkansas is doing very, very badly against any standard -- environment, support for police officers, whatever it is.", " Mr. Bush's Bureau of Labor Statistics says that Arkansas ranks first in the country in the growth of new jobs this year, first.", " This year.", " 4th in manufacturing jobs, 4th in the reduction of poverty, 4th in income increase.", "Over the last 10 years we've created manufacturing jobs much more rapidly than the national average.", "Over the last 5 years our income has grown more rapidly than the national average.", "We are 2nd in tax burden, the 2nd lowest tax burden in the country.", "We have the lowest per capita state and local spending in the country.", "We're low spending, low tax burden.", "We dramatically increased investment and our jobs are growing.", "I wish America had that kind of record and I think most people looking at us tonight would like it if we had more jobs and a lower spending burden on the government.", " I grew up 5 blocks from Arkansas.", "Let's put it in perspective.", "It's a beautiful state.", "It's a fairly rural state.", "It has a population less than Chicago or Los Angeles, about the size of Dallas and Forth Worth combined.", "So I think probably we're making a mistake night after night after night to cast the nation's future on a unit that small.", " It's irrelevant.", "(Laughter)", " No, no, no, but I could say, you know, that I ran a small grocery store on the corner, therefore I extrapolate that into the fact that I can run Wal-Mart.", "That's not true.", "(Laughter)  I can't protect an Arkansas company, you notice there, Governor.", " Mr. Perot, with all respect, I think it is highly relevant, and I think that a 4-billion dollar budget of state and federal funds is not all that small, and I think the fact that I took a state that was one of the poorest states in the country and had been for 153 years and tried my best to modernize its economy and to make the kind of changes that have generated support from people like the presidents of Apple Computer and Hewlett-Packard and some of the biggest companies in this country, 24 retired generals and admirals and hundreds of business executives, are highly relevant.", "And, you know, I'm frankly amazed that since you grew up 5 blocks from there you would think that what goes on in that state is irrelevant.", "I think it's been pretty impressive.", " It's not --", " And the people who have jobs -- (APPLAUSE)  The people who have jobs and educations and opportunities that didn't have them 10 years ago don't think it's irrelevant at all; they think it's highly relevant and they wish the rest of the country had them.", " I don't have a dog in this fight, but I'd like to get in on this.", " Well, you think it's relevant.", "(Laughter)", " Governor Clinton has to operate under a balanced budget amendment -- he has to do it, that is the law.", "I'd like to see a balanced budget amendment for America, to protect the American taxpayers, and then that would discipline not only the executive branch but the spending Congress, the Congress that's been in control of one party, his party, for 38 years.", "And we almost had it done.", "And that institution, the House of Representatives -- everyone is yelling \"Clean House!\"", "One of the reasons is we almost had it done, and the speaker -- a very, able, decent fellow, I might add -- but he twisted the arms of some of the sponsors of that legislation and had them change their vote.", "What's relevant here is that tool, that discipline, that he has to live by in Arkansas, and I'd like it for the American people.", "I want the line-item veto.", "I want a check-off, so if the Congress can't do it, let people check off their income tax, 10% of it, to compel the government to cut spending.", "And if they can't do it, if the Congress can't do it, let them then have to do it across the board.", "That's what we call a sequester.", "That's the discipline we need, and I'm working for that -- to protect the American taxpayer against the big spenders.", " Jim, I don't think that's a fair shot.", "I hear it -- I hear it echoed by political opponents.", "But I don't think it's fair.", "I think we've been fighting from day one to do something about the inner cities.", "I'm for enterprise zones.", "I have had it in every single proposal I've sent to the Congress.", "And now we hear a lot of talk, oh, well, we all want enterprise zones, and yet the House and the Senate can't send it down without loading it up with a lot of, you know, these Christmas tree ornaments they put on the legislation.", "I don't think in racial harmony that I'm a laggard on that.", "I've been speaking out since day 1.", "We've gotten the Americans for Disabilities Act, which I think is one of the foremost pieces of civil rights legislation.", "And yes, it took me to veto 2 civil rights quota bills because I don't believe in quotas, and I don't think the American people believe in quotas.", "And I beat back the Congress on that, and then we passed a decent civil rights bill that offers guarantees against discrimination in employment.", "And that is good.", "I've spoken out over and over again against antisemitism and racism, and I think my record as a member of Congress speaks for itself on that.", "What was the other part of it?", " I don't think that's true at all.", "I don't think that's true, but you know, let others fire away on it.", " I'd like to just talk about issues, and so --", " Well, no, but the point is that's a subjective thing.", "See, the subjective thing is when does President Bush react?", "And it would be very difficult for me to answer that in any short period of time.", " I thought you'd forgotten I was here.", " I will let the American people decide that.", "I would rather not critique the 2 candidates.", " The only thing I would say about that is, I think that on the economy, Mr. Bush said for a long time there was no recession, and then said it would be better to do nothing than to have a compromise effort with the Congress.", "He really didn't have a new economic program until over 1300 days into his presidency, and not all of his health care initiative has been presented to the Congress even now.", "I think it's important to elect a president who is committed to getting this economy going again, and who realizes we have to abandon trickle-down economics and put the American people first again, and who will send programs to the Congress in the first hundred days to deal with the critical issues that America is crying out for leadership on -- jobs, incomes, the health care crisis, the need to control the economy.", "Those things deserve to be dealt with from day one.", "I will deal with them from day 1.", "They will be my first priority, not my election year concern.", " Well, I think you're overlooking that we have had major accomplishments in the first term.", "But if you're talking about protecting the taxpayer against his friends in the US Congress, go back to what it was like when you had a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress.", "You don't have to go back to Herbert Hoover.", "Go back to Jimmy Carter, and interest rates were 21%, inflation was 15%.", "The misery index -- unemployment and inflation added together -- it was invented by the Democrats -- went right through the roof.", "We've cut it in half.", "And all you hear about is how bad things are.", "You know, remember the question, are you better off?", "Well, is a homebuyer better off he can refinance the home, because interest rates are down?", "Is the senior citizen better off because inflation is not wiping out their family's savings?", "I think they are.", "Is the guy out of work better off?", "Of course he's not, but he's not gonna be better off if we grow the government, if we invest, as Governor Clinton says, invest in more government.", "You've got to free up the private sector.", "You've got to let small businesses have more incentives.", "For 3 months -- quarters I've been fighting, 3 quarters been fighting to get the Congress to pass some incentives for small business.", "Capital gains, investment tax allowance, credit for first- time homebuyers.", "And it's blocked by the Congress.", "And then if a little of it comes my way, they load it up with Christmas trees and tax increases, and I have to stand up and favor the taxpayer.", " I think the General Motors thing is very relevant.", "I did everything I could to get General Motors to face its problems in the mid-'80s while it was still financially strong.", "They just wouldn't do it, and everybody now knows the terrible price they're paying by waiting until it's obvious to the brain-dead that they have problems.", "Now, hundreds, thousands of good, decent people, whole cities up here in this state are adversely impacted because they would not move in a timely way.", "Our government is that point now.", "The thing that I am in this race for is to tap the American people on the shoulder and to say to every single one of you, fix it while we're still relatively strong.", "If you have a heart problem, you don't wait till a heart attack to address it.", "So the General Motors experience is relevant.", "At the point when I could not get them to address those problems, I had created so much stress in the board, who wanted to just keep the Lawrence Welk music going, that they asked to buy my remaining shares.", "I sold them my remaining shares.", "They went their way.", "I went my way because it was obvious we had a complete disagreement about what should be done with the company.", "But let's take my life in perspective.", "Again and again, on complex, difficult tasks, I have stayed the course.", "When I was asked by our government to do the POW project, within a year the Vietnamese had sent people into Canada to make arrangements to have me and my family killed.", "And I had 5 small children, and my family and I decided we would stay the course, and we lived with that problem for 3 years.", "Then I got into the Texas War on Drugs program and the big-time drug dealers got all upset.", "Then when I had 2 people imprisoned in Iran, I could have left them there.", "I could have rationalized it.", "We went over, we got them out, we brought them back home.", "And since then, for years, I have lived with the burden of the Middle East, where it's eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth country, in terms of their unhappiness with the fact that I was successful in that effort.", "Again and again and again, in the middle of the night, at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, my government has called me to take extraordinary steps for Americans in distress, and again and again and again I have responded.", "And I didn't wilt and I didn't quit.", "Now, what happened in July we've covered again and again and again.", "But I think in terms of the American people's concern about my commitment, I'm here tonight, folks; I never quit supporting you as you put me on the ballot in the other 26 states; and when you asked me to come back in, I came back in.", "And talk about not quitting, I'm spending my money on this campaign; the 2 parties are spending your money, taxpayer money.", "I put my wallet on the table for you and your children.", "Over $60 million at least will go into this campaign to leave the American dream to you and your children, to get this country straightened out, because if anybody owes it to you, I do.", "I've lived the American dream; I'd like for your children to be able to live it, too.", "(Laughter)", " I don't have any criticism of Mr. Perot.", "I think what I'd like to talk about a minute, since you're asking the question, is the General Motors issue.", "I don't think there's any question that the automobile executives made some errors in the 1980s, but I also think we should look at how much productivity has increased lately, how much labor has done to increase productivity and how much management has done.", "And we're still losing a lot of auto jobs, in my judgment, because we don't have a national economic strategy that will build the industrial base of this country.", "Just today I met with the presidents and the vice presidents of the Willow Run union here, near here.", "They both said they were Vietnam veterans supporting me because I had an economic program to put them back to work.", "We need an investment incentive to modernize plant and equipment; we've got to control the health care costs for those people -- otherwise we can't keep the manufacturing jobs here; and we need a tough trade policy that is fair, that insists on open markets in return for open markets.", "We ought to have a strategy that will build the economic and industrial base.", "So I think Mr. Perot was right in questioning the management practices.", "But they didn't have much of a partner in government here as compared with the policies the Germans and the Japanese followed, and I believe we can do better.", "That's one of the things I want to change.", "I know that we can grow manufacturing jobs.", "We did it in my state, and we can do it nationally.", " To this?", " Well, I wondered, when Governor Clinton was talking to the auto workers, whether he talked about his and Senator Gore's favoring CAFE standards, fuel efficiency standards, of 40 miles per gallon.", "That would break the auto industry and throw a lot of people out of work.", "As regarding Mr. Perot, I take back something I said about him.", "I once said, in a frivolous moment, when he got out of the race: If you can't stand the heat, buy an air conditioning company.", "And I take it back, because I think -- he said he made a mistake.", "And the thing I find is if I make a mistake, I admit it.", "I've never heard Governor Clinton make a mistake.", "But one mistake he's made is fuel efficiency standards at 40 to 45 miles a gallon will throw many auto workers out of work, and you can't have it both ways.", "There's a pattern here of appealing to the auto workers and then trying to appeal to the spotted owl crowds or the extremes in the environmental movement.", "You can't do it as president: you can't have a pattern of one side of the issue one day and another the next.", "So my argument is not with Ross Perot; it is more with Governor Clinton.", " Let's just talk about the CAFE standards -- that's the fuel efficiency standards.", "They are now 27.5 miles per gallon per automobile fleet.", "I never said -- and I defy you to find where I said -- I gave an extensive environmental speech in April, and I said that we ought to have a goal of raising the fuel efficiency standards to 40 miles a gallon.", "I think that should be a goal.", "I have never said we should write it into law if there is evidence that that goal cannot be achieved.", "The Natl Science Foundation did a study which said it would be difficult for us to reach fuel efficiency standards in excess of 37 miles per gallon by the year 2000.", "I think we should try to raise the fuel efficiency.", "And let me say this.", "I think we ought to have incentives to do it, I think we ought to push to do it.", "That doesn't mean we have to write it into the law.", "Look, I am a job creator, not a job destroyer.", "It is the Bush administration that has had no new jobs in the private sector in the last 4 years.", "In my state, we're leading the country in private sector job growth.", "But it is good for America to improve fuel efficiency.", "We also ought to convert more vehicles to compressed natural gas.", "That's another way to improve the environment.", " Well, everybody's nibbling around the edges.", "Let's go to the center of the bull's-eye, the core problem.", "And believe me, everybody on the factory floor all over this country knows it.", "You implement that NAFTA, the Mexican trade agreement, where they pay people a dollar an hour, have no health care, no retirement, no pollution controls, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and you're going to hear a giant sucking sound of jobs being pulled out of this country right at a time when we need the tax base to pay the debt and pay down the interest on the debt and get our house back in order.", "We've got to proceed very carefully on that.", "See, there's a lot I don't understand.", "I do understand business.", "I do understand creating jobs.", "I do understand how to make things work.", "And I got a long history of doing that.", "Now, if you want to go to the core problem that faces everybody in manufacturing in this country, it's that agreement that's about to be put into practice.", "It's very simple.", "Everybody says it'll create jobs.", "Yes, it'll create bubble jobs.", "Now, you know, watch this -- listen very carefully to this.", "One-time surge while we build factories and ship machine tools and equipment down there.", "Then year after year for decades, they will have jobs.", "And I finally -- I thought I didn't understand it -- called all the experts, and they said, oh, it'll be disruptive for 12 to 15 years.", "We haven't got 12 days, folks.", "We cannot lose those jobs.", "They were eventually saying, Mexican jobs will eventually come to $7.50 an hour, ours will eventually go down to $7.50 an hour.", "Makes you feel real good to hear that, right?", "Let's think it through here.", "Let's be careful.", "I'm for free trade philosophically, but I have studied these trade agreements till the world has gone flat, and we don't have good trade agreements across the world.", "I hope we'll have a chance to get into that tonight, because I can get right to the center of the bull's-eye and tell you why we're losing whole industries in this country.", " Oh, no, it will cost jobs, but that's not -- let me say this.", "I'd rather, if you gave me 2 bad choices --", " I'd rather have some jobs left here than just see everything head south, see?", " No, I'm saying our principal need now is to stabilize the tax base, which is the job base, and create a growing, dynamic base.", "Now please, folks, if you don't hear anything else I say, remember where the -- millions of people at work are our tax base.", "Jim, one quick point.", "If you confiscate the Forbes 400 wealth, take it all, you cannot balance the budget this year.", "Kind of

conviction, he opposes the North American Free Trade Agreement.", "I am for the North American Free Trade Agreement.", "My problem with Governor Clinton, once again, is that one time he's gonna make up his mind, he sees some merit in it, but then he sees a lot of things wrong with it.", "Then the other day he says he's for it, however then we've got to pass other legislation.", "When you're president of the US, you cannot have this pattern of saying well, I'm for it but I'm on the other side of it.", "And it's true on this and it's true on CAFE.", "Look, if Ross were right when we get a free trade agreement with Mexico, why wouldn't they have gone down there now?", "You have a differential in wages right now.", "I just have an honest philosophical difference.", "I think free trade is going to expand our job opportunity.", "I think it is exports that have saved us when we're in a global slowdown, a connected global slowdown, a recession in some countries.", "And it's free trade, fair trade that needs to be our hallmark, and we need more free trade agreements, not fewer.", " I'd like to respond to that.", "You know, Mr. Bush was very grateful when I was among the Democrats who said he ought to have the authority to negotiate an agreement with Mexico.", "Neither I nor anybody else, as far a I know, agreed to give him our proxy to say that whatever he did was fine for the workers of this country and for the interests of this country.", "I am the one who's in the middle on this.", "Mr. Perot says it's a bad deal.", "Mr. Bush says it's a hunky-dory deal.", "I say on balance it does more good than harm if, if we can get some protection for the environment so that the Mexicans have to follow their own environmental standards, their own labor law standards, and if we have a genuine commitment to reeducate and retrain the American workers who lose their jobs and reinvest in this economy.", "I have a realistic approach to trade.", "I want more trade, and I know there are some good things in that agreement.", "But it can sure be made better.", "Let me just point out, just today in the Los Angeles Times Clyde Prestowitz, who was one of President Reagan's leading trade advisers and a life-long conservative Republican, endorsed my candidacy because he knows that I'll have a free and fair trade policy, a hard-headed, realistic policy, and not get caught up in rubber-stamping everything the Bush administration did.", "If I wanted to do that, why would I run for president, Jim?", "Anybody else can run the middle class down and run the economy in a ditch.", "I want to change it.", "(APPLAUSE)", " I think he made my case.", "On the one hand, it's a good deal but on the other hand I'd make it better.", "You can't do that as president.", "You can't do it on the war, where he says well, I was with the minority but I guess I would have voted with the majority.", "This is my point tonight.", "We're talking about 2 weeks from now you've gotta decide who's gonna be president.", "And there is this pattern that has plagued him in the primaries and now about trying to have it both ways on all these issues.", "You can't do that.", "And if you make a mistake, say you made a mistake and go on about your business, trying to serve the American people.", "Right now we heard it.", "Ross is against it.", "I am for it.", "He says on the one hand I am for it and on the other hand I may be against it.", " That's what's wrong with Mr. Bush.", "His whole deal is you've gotta be for it or against it, you can't make it better.", "I believe we can be better.", "I think the American people are sick and tired of either/or solutions, people being pushed in the corner, polarized to extremes.", " But I've always said trickle-down government is bad.", "

2.", "Is that the way it works?", " Now that we've talked all around the problem about free trade, let's go again to the center of the bull's- eye.", " I do, I do.", " I just want to make -- foreign lobbyists, this whole thing.", "Our country has sold out to foreign lobbyists.", "We don't have free trade.", "Both parties have foreign lobbyists on leaves in key roles in their campaigns.", "And if there's anything more unwise than that, I don't know what it is.", "Every debate I bring this up, and nobody ever addresses it.", "I would like for them to look you in the eye and tell you why they have people representing foreign countries working on their campaigns.", "And you know, you've seen the list, I've seen the list, we won't go into the names, but no wonder they -- if I had those people around me all day every day, telling me it was fair and free, I might believe it.", "But if I look at the facts as a businessman, it's so tilted, the first thing you ought to do is just say, guys, if you like these deals so well, we'll give you the deal you gave us.", "Now, Japanese couldn't unload the cars in this country if they had the same restrictions we had, and on and on and on and

the 2 candidates.", "They're foreign lobbyists taking leaves.", "What do you think they're going to do when the campaign's over?", "Go back to work at 30,000 bucks a month representing some other country.", "I don't believe that's in the American people's interest.", "I don't have a one of them, and I haven't taken a penny of foreign money, and I never will.", "(APPLAUSE)", " Most people that are lobbying are lobbying the Congress.", "And I don't think there's anything wrong with an honest person who happens to represent an interest of another country for making his case.", "That's the American way.", "And what you're assuming is that that makes the recipient of the lobbying corrupt or the lobbyist himself corrupt.", "I don't agree with that.", "But if I found somebody that had a conflict of interest that would try to illegally do something as a foreign -- registered lobby, the laws cover this.", "I don't know why -- I've never understood quite why Mr. Perot was so upset it, because one of the guys he used to have working for him, I believe, had foreign accounts.", "Could be wrong, but I think so.", " And as soon as I found it out, he went out the door.", "(Laughter)", " Well -- (APPLAUSE)  But I don't -- I think you got to look at the integrity and the honor of the people that are being lobbied and those that are lobbyists.", "The laws protect the American taxpayer in this regard.", "If the laws are violated so much, but to suggest if somebody represents a foreign country on anything, that makes him corrupt or against the taxpayer, I don't agree with that.", " One quick relevant specific.", "We're getting ready to dismantle the airlines industry in our country, and none of you know it.", "And I doubt in all candor if the president knows it.", "But this deal that we're doing with BAC and US Air and KLM and Northwest, guess who's on the president's campaign big time: a guy from Northwest.", "This deal is terribly destructive to the US airline industry.",

think there are any villains inside government on this issue, but there's sure a lot of people who don't understand business.", "And maybe you need somebody up there who understands when you're getting your pocket picked.", "(APPLAUSE)", " Jim.", " Why, I had a great response to that.", " Just very briefly.", "I think Ross is right and that we do need some more restrictions on lobbyists.", "We ought to make them disclose the people they've given money to when they're testifying before congressional committees; we ought to close the lawyers' loopholes; they ought to have to disclose when they're really lobbying.", "And we ought to have to limit -- we ought to have a much longer period of time, about 5 years, between the time when people can leave executive branch offices and then go out and start lobbying for foreign interests.", "I agree with that.", "We've wrecked the airline industry already because of all these leverage buyouts and all these terrible things that have happened to the airline industry.", "We're going to have a hard time rebuilding it.", "But the real thing we got to have is a competitive economic strategy.", "Look what's happening to McDonnell Douglas; even Boeing is losing market share -- because we let the Europeans spend $25-$40 billion on Airbus without an appropriate competitive response.", "What I want America to do is to trade more but to compete and win by investing in competitive ways.", "And we're in real trouble on that.", "(APPLAUSE)", " I promise it's less than 10 seconds.", " I heard Gov Clinton congratulate us on 1 thing -- first time he said something pleasant about this administration.", "Productivity in this country is up, it is way up -- productivity is up.", "And that's a good thing.", "There are many good ones, but I was glad

interests.", "So I have to stand up for myself.", "Now, Jim, let me get it out.", "On the 2nd debate, I offered, since both sides want the enterprise zones and we can't get together, I said I'll take a few days off and go to Washington and hold hands with you and we'll get it done.", "I'll take a few days off and hold hands with you and get this airlines thing straightened, because that's important to this country.", "That's kind of pathetic I have to do it -- and nobody's called me yet to come up, I might mention.", "(Laughter)", " But if they do -- if they do, it's easy to fix.", "If you all want the enterprise zones, why don't we pass the dang thing and do it, right?", " Uh-uh.", "Uh-uh.", "(APPLAUSE)", " If I had it to do over again I might answer the questions a little better.", "You know, I'd been in public life a long time and no one had ever questioned my role and so I was asked a lot of questions about things that happened a long time ago and I don't think I answered them as well as I could have.", "Going back 23 years, I don't know, Helen.", "I was opposed to the war.", "I couldn't help that.", "I felt very strongly about it, and I didn't want to go at the time.", "It's easy to say in retrospect I would have done something differently.", "President Lincoln opposed the war and there were people who said maybe he shouldn't be president, but I think he made us a pretty good president in wartime.", "We've had a lot of other presidents who didn't wear their country's uniform who had to order our young soldiers into battle, including President Wilson and President Roosevelt.", "So the answer is I could do that.", "I wouldn't relish doing it but I wouldn't shrink from it.", "I think that the president has to be prepared to use the power of the nation when our vital interests are threatened, when our treaty commitments are at stake, when we know that something has to be done that is in the national interest, and that is a part of being president.", "Could I do it?", "Yes, I could.", " Well, I've expressed my heartfelt difference with Governor Clinton on organizing demonstrations while in a foreign land against your country, when young ghetto kids have been drafted and are dying.", "My argument with him on -- the question was about the draft -- is that there's this same pattern.", "In New Hampshire Senator Kerrey said you ought to level, you ought to tell the truth about it.", "On April 17 he said he'd bring out all the records on the draft.", "They have not been forthcoming.", "He got a deferment or he didn't.", "He got a notice or he didn't.", "And I think it's this pattern that troubles me, more than the draft.", "A lot of decent, honorable people felt as he did on the draft.", "But it's this pattern.", "And again, you might be able to make amendments all the time, Governor, but you've got to, as president, you can't be on all these different sides, and you can't have this pattern of saying well, I did this or I didn't, then the facts come out and you change it.", "That's my big difference with him on the draft.", "It wasn't failing to serve.", " Yes, sir.", "Helen?", " I've spent my whole adult life very close to the military.", "I feel very strongly about the people who go into battle for our country.", "I appreciate their idealism, their sacrifices.", "Appreciate the sacrifices their families make.", "That's been displayed again and again in a very tangible way.", "I look on this as history.", "I don't look on it personally as relevant, and I consider it really a waste of time tonight, when you consider the issues that face our country right now.", " I wouldn't have taken any of the alternatives.", "I believe that -- I believe I made a mistake.", "I did it for the very reasons you say.", "There was one good thing that came out of that budget agreement, and that is we put a cap on discretionary spending.", "One-third of the president's budget is at the president's discretion, or really the Congress, since they appropriate every dime and tell a president how to spend every dime.", "We've put a cap on the growth of all that spending, and that's good and that's helped.", "But I was wrong because I thought the tax compromise, going along with 1 Democratic tax increase, would help the economy.", "I see no evidence that it has done it.", "So what would I have done?", "What should I have done?", "I should have held out for a better deal that would have protected the taxpayer and not ended up doing what we had to do, or what I thought at the time would help.", "So I made a mistake, and I -- you know, the difference, I think, is that I knew at the time I was going to take a lot of political flak.", "I knew we'd have somebody out there yelling \"read my lips\", and I did it because I thought it was right.", "And I made a mistake.", "That's quite different than taking a position where you know it's best for you.", "That wasn't best for me and I knew it in the very beginning.", "I thought it would be better for the country than it was.", "So there we are.", "(APPLAUSE)", " 101 in leadership is be accountable for what you do.", "Let's go back to the tax and budget summit briefly.", "Nobody ever told the American people that we increased spending $1.83 for every dollar of taxes raised.", "That's absolutely unconscionable.", "Both parties carry a huge blame for that on their shoulders.", "This was not a way to pay down the deficit.", "This was a trick on the American people.", "That's not leadership.", "Let's go back in terms of accepting responsibility for your actions.", "If you create Saddam Hussein, over a 10-year period, using billions of dollars of US taxpayer money, step up to the plate and say it was a mistake.", "If you create Noriega, using taxpayer money, step up to the plate and say it was a mistake.", "If you can't get your act together to pick him up one day when a Panamanian major has kidnapped him and a special forces team is 400 yards away and it's a stroll across the park to get him, and if you can't get your act together, at least pick up the Panamanian major, who they then killed, step up to the plate and admit it was a mistake.", "That's leadership, folks.", "Now, leaders will always make mistakes.", "We've created, and I'm not aiming at any one person here, I'm aiming at our government -- nobody takes responsibility for anything.", "We've gotta change that.", " I'm watching the lights.", " The mistake that was made was making the \"read my lips\" promise in the first place just to get elected, knowing what the size of the deficit was.", "(APPLAUSE)  Knowing what the size of the deficit was, knowing there was no plan to control health care costs and knowing that we did not have a strategy to get real economic growth back into this economy.", "The choices were not good then.", "I think at the time, the mistake that was made was signing off on the deal late on Saturday night in the middle of the night.", "That's just what the president did when he vetoed the Family Leave Act.", "I think what he should have done is gone before the American people on the front end and said listen, I made a commitment and it was wrong.", "I made a mistake because I couldn't have foreseen these circumstances and this is the best deal we can work out at the time.", "He said it was in the public interest at the time and most everybody who was involved in it, I guess, thought it was.", "The real mistake was the \"read my lips\" promise in the first place.", "You just can't promise something like that just to get elected if you know there's a good chance that circumstances may overtake you.", " You're talking about 2 different subjects.", "In order to lead, you first have to use the White House as a bully pulpit and lead; then you have to develop consensus or you can't get anything done, and that's where we are now.", "We can't get anything done.", "How do you get anything done when you've got all of these political action committees, all of these thousands of registered lobbyists -- 40,000 registered lobbyists, 23,000 special interest groups -- and the list goes on and on and on.", "And the average citizen out here is just working hard every day.", "You've got to go to the people.", "I just love the fact that everybody, particularly in the media, goes bonkers over the town hall.", "I guess it's because you will lose your right to tell them what to think.", "The point is, they'll get to decide what to think.", "(Laughter and applause)  I love the fact that people will listen to a guy with a bad accent and a poor presentation manner talking about flip charts for 30 minutes, because they want the details.", "See, all the folks up there at the top said the attention span of the American people is no more than 5 minutes, they won't watch it.", "They're thirsty for it.", "You want to have a new program in this country.", "If you get grassroots America excited about it, and if they tap Congress on the shoulder and say do it, Charlie, it'll happen.", "And that's a whole lot different from these fellows running up and down the halls whispering in their ears now and promising campaign funds for the next election if they do it.", "Now, I think that's going back to where we started.", "That's having a government from the people.", "I think that's the essence of leadership, rather than cutting deals in dark rooms in Washington.", "(APPLAUSE)", " Well, I believe in the town hall meetings; they started with my campaign in New Hampshire.", "And I think Ross Perot has done a good job in having them.", "And I, as you know, pushed for the debate to include the 209 American citizens who were part of it in Richmond a few days ago.", "I've done a lot of them, and I'll continue to do them as president.", "But I'd also like to point out that I haven't been part of what we're criticizing in Washington tonight.", "Of the 3 of us, I have balanced a government budget 12 times, I have offered and passed campaign finance reform, offered, pushed for and passed in public referendum lobbyist restrictions, done the kinds of things you have to do to get legislators together not only to establish consensus but to challenge them to change.", "And in 12 years as governor I guess I've taken on every interest group there was in my state at one time or another to fight for change.", "It can be done.", "That's why I tried to be so specific in this campaign to have a mandate, if elected, so that Congress will know what the American people have voted for.", "(APPLAUSE)", " I would like the record to show the panelists that Ross Perot took the first shot at the press.", "My favorite bumper sticker, though, is: Annoy the Media.", "Re-elect President Bush.", "And I just had to work that in.", "Sorry, Helen.", "(Laughter and applause)  I'm going to pay for this later on.", "Look, you have to build a consensus, but in some things -- Ross mentioned Saddam Hussein.", "Yes, we tried, and, yes, we failed to bring him into the family of nations; he had the 4th largest army.", "But then when he moved against Kuwait, I said this will not stand.", "And it's hard to build a consensus.", "We went to the UN, we made historic resolutions up there, the whole world was united, our Congress was dragging its feet.", "Governor Clinton said, well, I might have been with the minority, let sanctions work -- but I guess I would have voted with the majority.", "A president can't do that.", "Sometimes he has to act.", "And in this case I'm glad we did, because if we had let sanctions work and tried to build a consensus on that, Saddam Hussein today would be in Saudi Arabia controlling the world's oil supply, and he would be there maybe with a nuclear weapon.", "We busted the 4th largest army, and we did it through leadership.", " You don't see Margaret Tutwiler sitting in there with me today.", " Huh?", " I happen to think she's a key person.", "I think our Cabinet members are key people.", "I think the woman that works with me, Rose Zamaria, is about as tough as a boot out there and makes some discipline and protects the taxpayer.", "Look at our Cabinet.", "You talk about somebody strong.", "Look at Carla Hills.", "Look at Lynn Martin, who's fighting against this glass ceiling and doing a first-class job on it.", "Look at our surgeon general, Dr. Novello.", "You can look all around and you'll see first-class strong women.", "Jim Baker's a man.", "Yeah, I plead guilty to that.", "(Laughter)  But look who's around with him there.", "I mean, this is a little defensive on your part, Susan, to be honest with you.", "We've got a very good record appointing women to high positions and positions of trust, and I'm not defensive at all about it.", "What we got to do is keep working, as the Labor Dept is doing a first-class job on, to break down discrimination, to break down the glass ceiling.", "And I am not apologetic at all about our record with women.", "We've got, I think -- you know, you think about women in government, I think about women in business.", "Why not try to help them with my small business program to build some incentives into the system?", "I think we're making progress here.", "You got a lot of women running for office.", "As I said the other night, I hope a lot of them lose because they're liberal Democrats --  (Laughter)  -- and we don't need more of them in the Senate or more of them in the House.", "But nevertheless, they're out there.", "And we got some very good Republican women running.", "So we're making dramatic progress.", " Well, I come from the computer business, and everybody knows the women are more talented than the men.", "So we have a long history of having a lot of talented women.", "One of our first officers was a woman, the chief financial officer.", "She was a director.", "And it was so far back, it was considered so odd, and even though we were a tiny, little company at the time, it made all the national magazines.", "But in terms of being influenced by women and being a minority, there they are right out there, my wife and my 4 beautiful daughters, and I just have 1 son, so he and I are surrounded by women, giving -- telling us what to do all the time.", "(Laughter)  And the rest of my minute, I want to make a very brief comment here in terms of Saddam Hussein.", "We told him that we wouldn't get involved with his border dispute, and we've never revealed those papers that were given to Ambassador Glaspie on July the 25th.", "I suggest, in the sense of taking responsibility for your actions, we lay those papers on the table.", "They're not the secrets to the nuclear bomb.", "Secondly, we got upset when he took the whole thing, but to the ordinary American out there who doesn't know where the oil fields are in Kuwait, they're near the border.", "We told him he could take the northern part of Kuwait, and when he took the whole thing, we went nuts.", "And if we didn't tell him that, why won't we even let the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee see the written instructions for Ambassador Glaspie?", " I've got reply on that.", "That gets to the national honor.", "We did not say to Saddam Hussein, Ross, you can take the northern part of Kuwait.", " Well, where are the papers?", " That is absolutely absurd.", " Where are the papers?", " Glaspie has testified -- (APPLAUSE)  -- and Glaspie's papers have been presented to the US Senate.", "Please, let's be factual.", " If you have time, go through Nexis and Lexis, pull all the old news articles, look at what Ambassador Glaspie said all through the fall and what-have-you, and then look at what she and Kelly and all the others in State said at the end when they were trying to clean it up.", "And talk to any head of any of those key committees in the Senate.", "They will not let them see the written instructions given to Ambassador Glaspie.", "And I suggest that in a free society owned by the people, the American people ought to know what we told Ambassador Glaspie to tell Saddam Hussein, because we spent a lot of money and risked lives and lost lives in that effort, and did not accomplish most of our objectives.", "We got Kuwait back to the emir but he's still not his nuclear, his chemical, his bacteriological and he's still over there, right?", "I'd like to see those written instructions.", "(APPLAUSE)", " For which I apologize.", "When I make a mistake I say I'm sorry.", "(Laughter.)", " No, I don't.", "I apologize for it but that one got right to the national honor and I'm sorry.", "I just couldn't let it stand.", " Susan, I don't agree that there are no women and minorities in important positions in my campaign.", "There are many.", "But I think even more relevant is my record at home.", "For most of my time as governor a woman was my chief of staff.", "An African American was my chief cabinet officer.", "An African American was my chief economic development officer.", "It was interesting today.", "There was a story today or yesterday in the Washington Post about my economic programs and my chief budget officer and my chief economic officer were both African Americans, even though the Post didn't mention that, which I think is a sign of progress.", "The Natl Women's Political Caucus gave me an award, one of their Good Guy Awards, for my involvement of women in high levels of government, and I've appointed more minorities to positions of high level in government than all the governors in the history of my state combined, before me.", "So that's what I'll do as president.", "I don't think we've got a person to waste and I think I owe the American people a White House staff, a Cabinet and appointments that look like America but that meet high standards of excellence, and that's what I'll do.", "(APPLAUSE)", " No.", "They're not correct and if you look at my life, until I got involved in this effort, I was one person.", "And then after the Republican dirty tricks group got through with me I'm another person, which I consider an absolutely sick operation.", "And all of you in the press know exactly what I'm talking about.", "They investigated every single one of my children.", "They investigated my wife.", "They interviewed all of my children's friends from childhood on.", "They went to extraordinary sick lengths, and I just found it amusing that they would take 2 or 3 cases where I was involved in lawsuits and would engage an investigator -- the lawyers would engage an investigator, which is common.", "And the only difference between me and any other businessman that has the range of businesses that I have is I haven't had that many lawsuits.", "So that's just another one of those little fruit-loopy things they make up to try to, instead of facing issues, to try to redefine a person that's running against them.", "This goes on night and day.", "I will do everything I can, if I get up there, to make dirty tricks a thing of the past.", "One of the 2 groups has raised it to an art form.", "It's a sick art form.", "Now, let's go back to Saddam Hussein.", "We gave Ambassador Glaspie written instructions.", "That's a fact.", "We've never let the Congress and the Foreign Relations, Senate Intelligence Committees see them.", "That's a fact.", "Ambassador Glaspie did a lot of talking right after July 25 and that's a fact and it's in all the newspapers.", "And you pull all of it at once and read it and I did, and it's pretty clear what she and Kelly and the other key guys around that thing thought they were doing.", "Then at the end of the war, when they had to go testify about it, their stories are a total disconnect from what they said in August, September and October.", "So I say this is very simple.", "Saddam Hussein released a tape, as you know, claiming it was a transcript of their meeting, where she said we will not become involved in your border dispute and, in effect, you can take the northern part of the country.", "We later said no, that's not true.", "I said well, this is simple.", "What were her written instructions?", "We guard those like the secrets of the atomic bomb, literally.", "Now, I say whose country is this?", "This is ours.", "Who will get hurt if we lay those papers on the table?", "The worst thing is, again, it's a mistake.", "Nobody did any of this with evil intent.", "I just object to the fact that we cover up and hide things.", "Whether it's Iran-contra, Iraq-gate or you name it, it's a steady stream.", " Let's take Mr. Bush for the moment at his word -- he's right, we don't have any evidence at least that our government did tell Saddam Hussein he could have that part of Kuwait.", "And let's give him the credit he deserves for organizing Operation Desert Storm and Desert Shield.", "It was a remarkable event.", "But let's look at where I think the real mistake was made.", "In 1988 when the war between Iraq and Iran ended, we knew Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, we had dealt with him because he was against Iran -- the enemy of my enemy maybe is my friend.", "All right, the war's over; we know he's dropping mustard gas on his own people, we know he's threatened to incinerate half of Israel.", "Several government departments -- several -- had information that he was converting our aid to military purposes and trying to develop weapons of mass destruction.", "But in late '89 the president signed a secret policy saying we were going to continue to try to improve relations with him, and we sent him some sort of communication on the eve of his invasion of Kuwait that we still wanted better relations.", "So I think what was wrong -- I give credit where credit is due -- but the responsibility was in coddling Saddam Hussein when there was no reason to do it and when people at high levels in our government knew he was trying to do things that were outrageous.", " Well, it's awful easy when you're dealing with 90-90 hindsight.", "We did try to bring Saddam Hussein into the family of nations; he did have the 4th largest army.", "All our Arab allies out there thought we ought to do just exactly that.", "And when he crossed the line, I stood up and looked into the camera and I said: This aggression will not stand.", "And we formed a historic coalition, and we brought him down, and we destroyed the 4th largest army.", "And the battlefield was searched, and there wasn't one single iota of evidence that any US weapons were on that battlefield.", "And the nuclear capability has been searched by the United Nations, and there hasn't been one single scintilla of evidence that there's any US technology involved in it.", "And what you're seeing on all this Iraq-gate is a bunch of people who were wrong on the war trying to cover their necks here and try to do a little revisionism.", "And I cannot let that stand, because it isn't true.", "Yes, we had grain credits for Iraq, and there isn't any evidence that those grain credits were diverted into weaponry -- none, none whatsoever.", "(APPLAUSE)  And so I just have to say, it's fine.", "You can't stand there, Governor Clinton, and say, well, I think I'd have been -- I have supported the minority, let sanctions work or wish it would go away -- but I would have voted with the majority.", "Come on, that's not leadership.", " Gene, there is a problem in the sense that there are some problem banks, and on December 19th new regulations will go into effect which will in effect give the government the responsibility to close some banks that are not technically insolvent but that are plainly in trouble.", "On the other hand, I don't think that we have any reason to believe that the dimensions of this crisis are anywhere near as great as the savings and loan crisis.", "The mistake that both parties made in Washington with the S&amp;L business was deregulating them without proper capital requirements, proper oversight and regulation, proper training of the executives.", "Many people predicted what happened, and it was a disaster.", "The banking system in this country is fundamentally sound with some weak banks.", "I think that our goal ought to be first of all not to politicize it, not to frighten people; secondly to say that we have to enforce the law in 2 ways.", "We don't want to overreact, as the federal regulators have in my judgment, on good banks so that they've created credit crunches, that is, they have made our recession worse in the last couple of years -- but we do want to act prudently with the banks that are in trouble.", "We also want to say that insofar as is humanly possible the banking industry itself should pay for the cost of any bank failures; the taxpayers should not.", "And that will be my policy.", "And I believe if we have a good balanced approach, we can get the good banks loaning money again, end the credit crunch, have proper regulation on the ones that are in trouble, and not overreact.", "It is a serious problem, but I don't see it as the kind of terrible, terrible problem that the S&amp;L problem was.", " Well, I don't believe it would be appropriate for a president to suggest that the banking system is not sound.", "It is sound.", "There are some problem banks out there.", "But what we need is financial reform; we need some real financial reform, banking reform legislation.", "And I have proposed that.", "And when I am re-elected, I believe one of the first things ought to be to press a new Congress not beholden to the old ways to pass financial reform legislation that modernizes the banking system, doesn't put a lot of inhibitions on it, and protects the depositors through keeping the FDIC sound.", "But I think that -- I just was watching some of the proceedings of the American Bankers Assn, and I think the general feeling is most of the banks are sound, certainly there's no comparison here between what happened to the S&amp;Ls and where the banks stand right now, in my view.", " Well, nobody's gotten into the real issue yet on the savings and loan again -- nobody's got a business background, I guess.", "The whole problem came up in 1984.", "The president of the US was told officially it was a $20-billion problem.", "These crooks -- now, Willie Sutton would have gone to own a savings and loan rather than rob banks, because he robbed banks because that's where the money is; owning a savings and loan is where the money was.", "Now, in 1984 they were told.", "I believe the vice president was in charge of deregulation.", "Nobody touched that tar baby till the day after election in 1988 because they were flooding both parties with crooked PAC money, and it was in many cases stolen PAC money.", "Now, you and I never got a ride on a lot of these yachts and fancy things it bought, but you and I are paying for it.", "And they buried it till right after the election.", "Now, if you believe The Washington Post and you believe this extensive study that's been done -- and I'm reading it -- right after election day this year they're going to hit us with a hundred banks, it will be a $100-billion problem.", "Now, if that's true, just tell me now.", "I'm grownup, I can deal with it, I'll pay my share.", "But just tell me now; don't bury until after the election twice.", "I say that to both political parties.", "The people deserve that since we have to pick up the tab; you got the PAC money, we'll pay the tab.", "Just tell us.", " The debt and the deficit.", "Well, if you watched my television show the other night, you saw it.", "And if you watch it Thursday, Friday, Saturday this week, you'll get more.", "A shameless plug there, Mr. President.", "But in a nutshell we've got to reform our government or we won't get anything done.", "We have a government that doesn't work.", "All these specific examples I'm giving tonight -- if you had a business like that, they'd be leading you away and boarding up the doors.", "We have a government that doesn't work.", "It's supposed to come from the people, it comes at the people.", "The people need to take their government back.", "You've got to reform Congress, they've got to be servants of the people again; you've got to reform the White House.", "We've got to turn this thing around.", "And it's a long list of specific items.", "And I've covered it again and again in print and on television.", "But very specifically the key thing is to turn the government back to the people and take it away from the special interests and have people go to Washington to serve.", "Who can give themselves a 23% pay raise anywhere in the world except Congress?", "Who would have 1200 airplanes worth 2 billion a year just to fly around in?", "I don't have a free reserved parking place at Natl Airport, why should my servants?", "I don't have an indoor gymnasium and an indoor tennis and an indoor every other thing they can think of; I don't have a place where I can go make free TV to send to my constituents to try to brainwash them to elect me the next time.", "And I'm paying for all that for those guys.", "I'm going to be running an ad pretty soon that shows they promised us they were going to hold the line on spending at the tax and budget summit, and I'm going to show how much they've increased this little stuff they do for themselves.", "And it is silly putty, folks, and the American people have had enough of it.", "Step one, if I get up there, we're going to clean that up.", "You say, how can I get Congress to do that?", "I'll have millions of people at my shoulder, shoulder to shoulder with me, and we will see it done work speed -- because it's wrong.", "We've turned the country upside down.", "(APPLAUSE)", " I would just point out, on the point Mr. Perot made, I agree that we need to cut spending in Congress.", "I've called for a 25% reduction in congressional staffs and expenditures.", "But the White House staff increased its expenditures by considerably more than Congress has in the last 4 years under the Bush administration, and Congress has actually spent a billion dollars less than President Bush asked them to spend.", "Now, when you out-spend Congress you're really swinging.", "That, however, is not my only passion.", "The real problem in this country is that most people are working hard and falling farther behind.", "My passion is to pass a jobs program and get incomes up with an investment incentive program to grow jobs in the private sector, to waste less public money and invest more, to control health care costs and provide for affordable health care for all Americans and to make sure we've got the best trained workforce in the world.", "That is my passion.", "We've gotta get this country growing again and this economy strong again or we can't bring down the deficit.", "Economic growth is the key to the future of this country.", "(APPLAUSE)", " On government reform?", " Government reform?", " Well, how about this for a government reform policy?", "Reduce the White House staff by a 3rd after or at the same time the Congress does the same thing for their staff.", "Term limits for members of the US Congress.", "Give the government back to the people.", "Let's do it that way.", "The president has term limits.", "Let's limit some of these guys sitting out here tonight.", "(APPLAUSE)  Term limits.", "And then how about a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution?", "Forty-3 -- more than that -- states have it, I believe.", "Let's try that.", "And you want to do something about all this extra spending that concerns Mr. Perot and me?", "Okay.", "How about a line item veto?", "Forty-three governors have that.", "And give it to the president, and if the Congress isn't big enough to do it, let the president have a shot at this excess spending.", "A line item veto.", "That means you can take a line and cut out some of the pork out of a meaningful bill.", "Governor Clinton keeps hitting me on vetoing legislation.", "Well, that's the only protection the taxpayer has against some of these reckless pork programs up there, and I'd rather be able to just line it right out of there and get on about passing some good stuff but leave out the garbage.", "Line item veto -- there's a good reform program for you.", " My plan -- you can read my plan.", "My plan says that we want to raise marginal incomes on family incomes above $200,000 from 31 to 36 percent, that we want to ask foreign corporations simply to pay the same percentage of taxes on their income that American corporations play (sic) in America, that we want to use that money to provide over $100 billion in tax cuts for investment in new plant and equipment, for small business, for new technologies, and for middle class tax relief.", "Now, I'll tell ya this.", "I will not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs.", "If the money does not come in there to pay for these programs, we will cut other government spending or we will slow down the phase-in of the programs.", "I am not gonna raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs.", "Now furthermore, I am not gonna tell you \"read my lips\" on anything because I cannot foresee what emergencies might develop in this country.", "And the president said never, never, never would he raise taxes in New Jersey, and within a day Marlin Fitzwater, his spokesman, said now, that's not a promise.", "So I think even he has learned that you can't say \"read my lips\" because you can't know what emergencies might come up.", "But I can tell you this.", "I'm not gonna raise taxes on middle class Americans to pay for the programs I've recommended.", "Read my plan.", "And you know how you can trust me about that?", "Because you know, in the first debate, Mr. Bush made some news.", "He'd just said Jim Baker was going to be secretary of state and in the first debate he said no, now he's gonna be responsible for domestic economic policy.", "Well, I'll tell ya.", "I'll make some news in the 3rd debate.", "The person responsible for domestic economic policy in my administration will be Bill Clinton.", "I'm gonna make those decisions, and I won't raise taxes on the middle class to pay for my programs.", "(APPLAUSE)", " That's what worries me -- (Laughter and applause)  -- that he's going to be responsible.", "He's going to do -- and he would do for the US what he's done to Arkansas.", "He would do for the US what he's done to Arkansas.", "We do not want to be the lowest of the low.", "We are not a nation in decline.", "(APPLAUSE)  We are a rising nation.", "Now, my problem is -- I heard what he said.", "He said I want to take it from the rich, raise $150 billion from the rich.", "To get it, to get $150 billion in new taxes, you got to go down to the guy that's making $36,600.", "And if you want to pay for the rest of his plan, all the other spending programs, you're going to sock it to the working man.", "So when you hear \"tax the rich,\" Mr. and Mrs. America, watch your wallet.", "Lock your wallet because he's coming right after you just like Jimmy Carter did and just like you're going to get -- you're going to end up with interest rates at 21%, and you're going to have inflation going through the roof.", "Yes, we're having tough times, but we do not need to go back to the failed policies of the past, when you had a Democratic president and a spendthrift Democratic Congress.", "(APPLAUSE)", " Jim, you permitted Mr. Bush to break the rules, he said, to defend the honor of the country.", "What about the honor of my state?", "We rank first in the country in job growth, we got the lowest spending, state and local, in the country, and the 2nd lowest tax burden.", "And the difference between Arkansas and the US is that we're going in the right direction and this country's going in the wrong direction.", "And I have to defend the honor of my state.", "(APPLAUSE)", " So I'm the only one that's untarnished at this point?", " I'm sure I'll do it before it's over.", "(Laughter)  Key thing here, see, we all come up with images.", "Images don't fix anything.", "I think -- you know, I'm starting to understand it.", "You stay around this long enough, you think about -- if you talk about it in Washington, you think you did it.", "If you've been on television about it, you think you did it.", "(Laughter)  What we need is people to stop talking and start doing.", "Now, our real problem here is they both have plans that will not work.", "The Wall Street Journal said your numbers don't add up.", "And you can take it out on charts, you look at all the studies the different groups have done, you go out 4, 5, 6 years, we're still drifting along with a huge deficit.", "So let's come back to harsh reality, and what I -- you know, everybody says, gee, Perot, you're tough.", "I'm saying, well, this is not as tough as World War II and it's not as tough as the revolution.", "And it's fair, shared sacrifice to do the right thing for our country and for our children.", "And it will be fun if we all work together to do it.", " Well, I think the answer to why the drop, I think, has been the economy in the doldrums.", "Why I'll win is I think I have the best plan of the 3 of us up here to do something about it.", "Mine does not grow the government, it does not invest, have government invest.", "It says we need to do better in terms of stimulating private business.", "We got a big philosophical difference here tonight between one who thinks the government can do all these things through tax and spend, and one who thinks it ought to go the other way.", "And so I believe the answer is, I'm going to win it because I'm getting into focus my agenda for America's renewal, and also I think that Governor Clinton's had pretty much of a free ride.", "On looking specifically at the Arkansas record -- he keeps criticizing us, criticizing me, I'm the incumbent, fine.", "But he's an incumbent, and we've got to look at all the facts.", "They're almost at the bottom on every single category.", "We can't do that to the American people.", "And then, Helen, I really believe where people are going to ask this question about trust, because I do think there's a pattern by Governor Clinton of saying one thing to please one group, and then trying to please another group.", "And I think that pattern is a dangerous thing to suggest would work for the Oval Office.", "It doesn't work that way when you're president.", "Truman is right.", "The buck stops there.", "And you have to make decisions even when it's against your own interest.", "And I've done that.", "It's against my political interest to say go ahead and go along with the tax increase, but I did what I thought was right at the time.", "So I think people are going to be looking for trust and experience.", "And then, I mentioned it the other night, I think if there's a crisis, people are going to say, well, George Bush has taken us through some tough crises, and we trust him to do that.", "And so I'll make the appeal on a wide array of issues.", "Also I got a philosophical difference.", "I got to watch the clock here.", "I don't think we're a declining nation.", "The whole world has had economic problems.", "We're doing better than a lot of the countries in the world.", "And we're going to lead the way out of this economic recession across this world and economic slowdown here at home.", " That's why I think I'll win.", " I'm the last one, right?", " One minute after you.", " I'm totally focussed on the fact that we may have bank failures and nobody answered it.", "I'm totally focussed on the fact that we are still evading the issue of the Glaspie papers.", "I'm totally focussed on the fact that we still could have enterprise zones, according to both parties, but we don't.", "So I am still focussed on gridlock, I guess.", "And I am also focussed on the fact that isn't it a paradox that we have the highest productivity in our workforce in the industrialized world and at the same time have the largest trade deficit, and at the same time rank behind 9 other nations in what we pay our most productive people in the world, and we're losing whole industries overseas.", "Now, can't somebody agree with me that the government is breaking business's legs with these trade agreements?", "They're breaking business's legs in a number of different ways.", "We have an adversarial relationship that's destroying jobs and sending them overseas while we have the finest workers in the world.", "Keep in mind a factory worker has nothing to do with anything except putting it together on the factory floor.", "It's our obligation to make sure that we give him the finest products in the world to put together and we don't break his legs in the process.", " I really can't believe Mr. Bush is still trying to make trust an issue after \"read my lips\" and 15 million new jobs and embracing what he called voodoo economics and embracing an export enhancement program for farmers he threatened to veto and going all around the country giving out money in programs that he once opposed.", "But the main thing is he still didn't get it, from what he said the other night to that fine woman on our program, the 209 people in Richmond.", "They don't want us talking about each other.", "They want us to talk about the problems of this country.", "I don't think he'll be reelected because trickle down economics is a failure and he's offering more of it, and what he's saying about my program is just not true.", "Look at the Republicans that have endorsed me.", "High tech executives in Northern California.", "Look at the 24 generals and admirals, retired, that have endorsed me, including the deputy commander of Desert Storm.", "Look at Sarah Brady, Jim Brady's wife, President Reagan's press secretary, who endorsed me because he knuckled under to the NRA and wouldn't fight for the Brady Bill.", "We've got a broad-based coalition that goes beyond party because I am going to change this country and make it better, with the help of the American people.", "(APPLAUSE)", " First, I'd like to thank the commission and my opponents for participating in these debates and making them possible.", "I think the real winners of the debates were the American people.", "I was especially moved in Richmond a few days ago when 209 of our fellow citizens got to ask us questions.", "They went a long way toward reclaiming this election for the American people and taking their country back.", "I want to say, since this is the last time I'll be on a platform with my opponents, that even though I disagree with Mr. Perot on how fast we can reduce the deficit and how much we can increase taxes on the middle class, I really respect what he's done in this campaign to bring the issue of deficit reduction to our attention.", "I'd like to say to Mr. Bush, even though I've got profound differences with him, I do honor his service to our country.", "I appreciate his efforts and I wish him well.", "I just believe it's time to change.", "I offer a new approach.", "It's not trickle down economics.", "It's been tried for 12 years and it's failed.", "More people are working harder for less, 100,000 people a month losing their health insurance, unemployment going up, our economy slowing down.", "We can do better.", "And it's not tax and spend economics.", "It's invest and grow, put our people first, control health care costs and provide basic health care to all Americans, have an education system 2nd to none and revitalize the private economy.", "That is my commitment to you.", "It is the kind of change that can open up a whole new world of opportunities to America as we enter the last decade of this century and move towards the 21st century.", "I want a country where people who work hard and play by the rules are rewarded, not punished.", "I want a country where people are coming together across the lines of race and region and income.", "I know we can do better.", "It won't take miracles and it won't happen overnight, but we can do much, much better if we have the courage to change.", "Thank you very much.", "(APPLAUSE)", " Three weeks from now -- 2 weeks from tomorrow, America goes to the polls and you're going to have to decide who you want to lead this country to economic recovery.", "On jobs -- that's the number one priority, and I believe my program for stimulating investment, encouraging small business, brand-new approach to education, strengthening the American family, and, yes, creating more exports is the way to go.", "I don't believe in trickle-down government, I don't believe in larger taxes and larger government spending.", "On foreign affairs, some think it's irrelevant.", "I believe it's not.", "We're living in an interconnected world.", "The whole world is having economic difficulties.", "The US is doing better than a lot.", "But we've got to do even better.", "And if a crisis comes up, I ask who has the judgment and the experience and, yes, the character to make the right decision?", "And, lastly, the other night on character Governor Clinton said it's not the character of the president but the character of the presidency.", "I couldn't disagree more.", "Horace Greeley said the only thing that endures is character.", "And I think it was Justice Black who talked about great nations, like great men, must keep their word.", "And so the question is, who will safeguard this nation, who will safeguard our people and our children?", "I need your support, I ask for your vote.", "And may God bless the US of America.", "(APPLAUSE)", " To the millions of fine decent people who did the unthinkable and took their country back in their own hands and put me on the ballot, let me pledge to you that tonight is just the beginning.", "These next 2 weeks we will be going full steam ahead to make sure that you get a voice and that you get your country back.", "This Thursday night on ABC from 8:30 to 9, Friday night on NBC from 8 to 8:30, and Saturday night on CBS from 8 to 8:30, we'll be down in the trenches under the hood working on fixin' the old car to get it back on the road.", "Now, the question is, can we win?", "Absolutely we can win, because it's your country.", "Question really is who do you want in the White House.", "It's that simple.", "Now, you got to stop letting these people tell you who to vote for, you got to stop letting these folks in the press tell you you're throwing your vote away -- you got to start using your own head.", "(APPLAUSE)  Then the question is, can we govern?", "I love that one.", "The \"we\" is you and me.", "You bet your hat we can govern because we will be in there together and we will figure out what to do, and you won't tolerate gridlock, you won't tolerate endless meandering and wandering around, and you won't tolerate non-performance.", "And, believe me, anybody that knows me understands I have a very low tolerance for non-performance also.", "Together we can get anything done.", "The president mentioned that you need the right person in a crisis.", "Well, folks, we got one, and that one is a financial crisis.", "Pretty simply, who's the best-qualified person up here on the stage to create jobs?", "Make your decision and vote on November the 3rd.", "I suggest you might consider somebody who's created jobs.", "Who's the best person to manage money?", "I suggest you pick a person who's successfully managed money.", "Who's the best person to get results and not talk?", "Look at the record and make your decision.", "And, finally, who would you give your pension fund and your savings account to manage?", "And, last one, who would you ask to be the trustee of your estate and take care of your children if something happened to you?", "Finally, to you students up there -- God bless you, I'm doing this for you: I want you to have the American dream.", "(APPLAUSE)  To the American people, I'm doing this because I love you.", "That's it.", "Thank you very much.", "(APPLAUSE)", " Thank you, Jeremy.", "I appreciate your -- your question, and thank you for being here this evening and to all of those from Nassau County that have come, thank you for your time.", "Thank you to Hofstra University and to Candy Crowley for organizing and leading this -- this event.", "Thank you, Mr. President, also for being part of this -- this debate.", "Your question -- your question is one that's being asked by college kids all over this country.", "I was in Pennsylvania with someone who had just graduated -- this was in Philadelphia -- and she said, \"I've got my degree.", "I can't find a job.", "I've got three part- time jobs.", "They're just barely enough to pay for my food and pay for an apartment.", "I can't begin to pay back my student loans.\"", "So what we have to do is two things.", "We have to make sure that we make it easier for kids to afford college.", " And also make sure that when they get out of college, there's a job.", "When I was governor of Massachusetts, to get a high school degree, you had to pass an exam.", "If you graduated in the top quarter of your airlines, we gave you a John and Abigail Adams scholarship, four years tuition free in the college of your choice in Massachusetts, it's a public institution.", "I want to make sure we keep our Pell grant program growing.", "We're also going to have our loan program, so that people are able to afford school.", "But the key thing is to make sure you can get a job when you get out of school.", "And what's happened over the last four years has been very, very hard for America's young people.", "I want you to be able to get a job.", "I know what it takes to get this economy going.", "With half of college kids graduating this year without a college -- excuse me, without a job.", "And without a college level job, that's just unacceptable.", "And likewise you've got more and more debt on your back.", "So more debt and less jobs.", "I'm going to change that.", "I know what it takes to create good jobs again.", "I know what it takes to make sure that you have the kind of opportunity you deserve.", "And kids across this country are going to recognize, we're bringing back an economy.", "It's not going to be like the last four years.", "The middle-class has been crushed over the last four years, and jobs have been too scarce.", "I know what it takes to bring them back, and I'm going to do that, and make sure that when you graduate -- when do you graduate?", " 2014.", "When you come out in 2014, I presume I'm going to be president.", "I'm going to make sure you get a job.", "Thanks Jeremy.", "Yeah, you bet.", " Jeremy, first of all, your future is bright.", "And the fact that you're making an investment in higher education is critical.", "Not just to you, but to the entire nation.", "Now, the most important thing we can do is to make sure that we are creating jobs in this country.", "But not just jobs, good paying jobs.", "Ones that can support a family.", " And what I want to do, is build on the five million jobs that we've created over the last 30 months in the private sector alone.", "And there are a bunch of things we can do to make sure your future is bright.", "Number one, I want to build manufacturing jobs in this country again.", "Now when Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt.", "I said we're going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry and it's come surging back.", "I want to do that in industries, not just in Detroit, but all across the country and that means we change our tax code so we're giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the United States and creating jobs here.", "It also means we're helping them and small businesses to export all around the world to new markets.", "Number two, we've got to make sure that we have the best education system in the world.", "And the fact that you're going to college is great, but I want everybody to get a great education and we've worked hard to make sure that student loans are available for folks like you, but I also want to make sure that community colleges are offering slots for workers to get retrained for the jobs that are out there right now and the jobs of the future.", "Number three, we've got to control our own energy.", "Now, not only oil and natural gas, which we've been investing in; but also, we've got to make sure we're building the energy source of the future, not just thinking about next year, but ten years from now, 20 years from now.", "That's why we've invested in solar and wind and biofuels, energy efficient cars.", "We've got to reduce our deficit, but we've got to do it in a balanced way.", "Asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more along with cuts so that we can invest in education like yours.", "And let's take the money that we've been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild America, roads, bridges schools.", "We do those things, not only is your future going to be bright but America's future is going to bright as well.", " Well what you're seeing in this country is 23 million people struggling to find a job.", "And a lot of them, as you say, Candy, have been out of work for a long, long, long time.", "The president's policies have been exercised over the last four years and they haven't put Americans back to work.", "We have fewer people working today than we had when the president took office.", "If the -- the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent when he took office, it's 7.8 percent now.", "But if you calculated that unemployment rate, taking back the people who dropped out of the workforce, it would be 10.7 percent.", "We have not made the progress we need to make to put people back to work.", "That's why I put out a five-point plan that gets America 12 million new jobs in four years and rising take-home pay.", "It's going to help Jeremy get a job when he comes out of school.", "It's going to help people across the country that are unemployed right now.", "And one thing that the president said, which I want to make sure that we understand, he said that I said we should take Detroit bankrupt.", "And that's right.", "My plan was to have the company go through bankruptcy like 7-Eleven did and Macy's and Condell (ph) Airlines and come out stronger.", "And I know he keeps saying, you want to take Detroit bankrupt.", "Well, the president took Detroit bankrupt.", "You took General Motors bankrupt.", "You took Chrysler bankrupt.", "So when you say that I wanted to take the auto industry bankrupt, you actually did.", "And I think it's important to know that that was a process that was necessary to get those companies back on their feet, so they could start hiring more people.", "That was precisely what I recommended and ultimately what happened.", " Candy, what Governor Romney said just isn't true.", "He wanted to take them into bankruptcy without providing them any way to stay open.", "And we would have lost a million jobs.", "And that -- don't take my word for it, take the executives at GM and Chrysler, some of whom are Republicans, may even support Governor Romney.", "But they'll tell you his prescription wasn't going to work.", "And Governor Romney's says he's got a five-point plan?", "Governor Romney doesn't have a five-point plan.", "He has a one-point plan.", "And that plan is to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules.", "That's been his philosophy in the private sector, that's been his philosophy as governor, that's been his philosophy as a presidential candidate.", "You can make a lot of money and pay lower tax rates than somebody who makes a lot less.", "You can ship jobs overseas and get tax breaks for it.", "You can invest in a company, bankrupt it, lay off the workers, strip away their pensions, and you still make money.", "That's exactly the philosophy that we've seen in place for the last decade.", "That's what's been squeezing middle class families.", "And we have fought back for four years to get out of that mess.", "The last thing we need to do is to go back to the very same policies that got us there.", " That -- that Detroit -- that Detroit answer...", " ... that Detroit answer...", " ... and the rest of the answer, way off the mark.", " The most important thing we can do is to make sure we control our own energy.", "So here's what I've done since I've been president.", "We have increased oil production to the highest levels in 16 years.", "Natural gas production is the highest it's been in decades.", "We have seen increases in coal production and coal employment.", "But what I've also said is we can't just produce traditional source of energy.", "We've also got to look to the future.", "That's why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars.", "That means that in the middle of the next decade, any car you buy, you're going to end up going twice as far on a gallon of gas.", "That's why we doubled clean -- clean energy production like wind and solar and biofuels.", "And all these things have contributed to us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in 16 years.", "Now, I want to build on that.", "And that means, yes, we still continue to open up new areas for drilling.", "We continue to make it a priority for us to go after natural gas.", "We've got potentially 600,000 jobs and 100 years worth of energy right beneath our feet with natural gas.", "And we can do it in an environmentally sound way.", "But we've also got to continue to figure out how we have efficiency energy, because ultimately that's how we're going to reduce demand and that's what's going to keep gas prices lower.", "Now, Governor Romney will say he's got an all-of-the-above plan, but basically his plan is to let the oil companies write the energy policies.", "So he's got the oil and gas part, but he doesn't have the clean energy part.", "And if we are only thinking about tomorrow or the next day and not thinking about 10 years from now, we're not going to control our own economic future.", "Because China, Germany, they're making these investments.", "And I'm not going to cede those jobs of the future to those countries.", "I expect those new energy sources to be built right here in the United States.", "That's going to help Jeremy get a job.", "It's also going to make sure that you're not paying as much for gas.", " Well, let's look at the president's policies, all right, as opposed to the rhetoric, because we've had four years of policies being played out.", "And the president's right in terms of the additional oil production, but none of it came on federal land.", "As a matter of fact, oil production is down 14 percent this year on federal land, and gas production was down 9 percent.", "Why?", "Because the president cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands, and in federal waters.", "So where'd the increase come from?", "Well a lot of it came from the Bakken Range in North Dakota.", "What was his participation there?", "The administration brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil, this massive new resource we have.", "And what was the cost?", "20 or 25 birds were killed and brought out a migratory bird act to go after them on a criminal basis.", "Look, I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables.", "I believe very much in our renewable capabilities; ethanol, wind, solar will be an important part of our energy mix.", "But what we don't need is to have the president keeping us from taking advantage of oil, coal and gas.", "This has not been Mr. Oil, or Mr. Gas, or Mr. Coal.", "Talk to the people that are working in those industries.", "I was in coal country.", "People grabbed my arms and said, \"Please save my job.\"", "The head of the EPA said, \"You can't build a coal plant.", "You'll virtually -- it's virtually impossible given our regulations.\"", "When the president ran for office, he said if you build a coal plant, you can go ahead, but you'll go bankrupt.", "That's not the right course for America.", "Let's take advantage of the energy resources we have, as well as the energy sources for the future.", "And if we do that, if we do what I'm planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, North America energy independence within eight years, you're going to see manufacturing jobs come back.", "Because our energy is low cost, that are already beginning to come back because of our abundant energy.", "I'll get America and North America energy independent.", "I'll do it by more drilling, more permits and licenses.", "We're going to bring that pipeline in from Canada.", "How in the world the president said no to that pipeline?", "I will never know.", "This is about bringing good jobs back for the middle class of America, and that's what I'm going to do.", " Mr. President, let me just see if I can move you to the gist of this question, which is, are we looking at the new normal?", "I can tell you that tomorrow morning, a lot of people in Hempstead will wake up and fill up and they will find that the price of gas is over $4 a gallon.", "Is it within the purview of the government to bring those prices down, or are we looking at the new normal?", " Candy, there's no doubt that world demand's gone up, but our production is going up, and we're using oil more efficiently.", "And very little of what Governor Romney just said is true.", "We've opened up public lands.", "We're actually drilling more on public lands than in the previous administration and my -- the previous president was an oil man.", "And natural gas isn't just appearing magically.", "We're encouraging it and working with the industry.", "And when I hear Governor Romney say he's a big coal guy, I mean, keep in mind, when -- Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts, you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, \"This plant kills,\" and took great pride in shutting it down.", "And now suddenly you're a big champion of coal.", "So what I've tried to do is be consistent.", "With respect to something like coal, we made the largest investment in clean coal technology, to make sure that even as we're producing more coal, we're producing it cleaner and smarter.", "Same thing with oil, same thing with natural gas.", "And the proof is our oil imports are down to the lowest levels in 20 years.", "Oil production is up, natural gas production is up, and, most importantly, we're also starting to build cars that are more efficient.", "And that's creating jobs.", "That means those cars can be exported, 'cause that's the demand around the world, and it also means that it'll save money in your pocketbook.", " That's the strategy you need, an all-of-the-above strategy, and that's what we're going to do in the next four years.", " But that's not what you've done in the last four years.", "That's the problem.", "In the last four years, you cut permits and licenses on federal land and federal waters in half.", " Not true, Governor Romney.", " So how much did you cut (inaudible)?", " Not true.", " How much did you cut them by, then?", " Governor, we have actually produced more oil --", " No, no.", "How much did you cut licenses and permits on federal land and federal waters?", " Governor Romney, here's what we did.", "There were a whole bunch of oil companies.", "(CROSSTALK)", " No, no, I had a question and the question was how much did you cut them by?", " You want me to answer a question --", " How much did you cut them by?", " I'm happy to answer the question.", " All right.", "And it is --", " Here's what happened.", "You had a whole bunch of oil companies who had leases on public lands that they weren't using.", "So what we said was you can't just sit on this for 10, 20, 30 years, decide when you want to drill, when you want to produce, when it's most profitable for you.", "These are public lands.", "So if you want to drill on public lands, you use it or you lose it.", " OK, (inaudible) --", " And so what we did was take away those leases.", "And we are now reletting them so that we can actually make a profit.", " And production on private -- on government land --", " Production is up.", " -- is down.", " No, it isn't.", " Production on government land of oil is down 14 percent.", " Governor --", " And production on gas -- (CROSSTALK)", " It's just not true.", " It's absolutely true.", "Look, there's no question but the people recognize that we have not produced more (inaudible) on federal lands and in federal waters.", "And coal, coal production is not up; coal jobs are not up.", "I was just at a coal facility, where some 1,200 people lost their jobs.", "The right course for America is to have a true all-of-the-above policy.", "I don't think anyone really believes that you're a person who's going to be pushing for oil and gas and coal.", "You'll get your chance in a moment.", "I'm still speaking.", " Well --", " And the answer is I don't believe people think that's the case --", " -- (inaudible).", " That wasn't the question.", " OK.", " That was a statement.", "I don't think the American people believe that.", "I will fight for oil, coal and natural gas.", "And the proof, the proof of whether a strategy is working or not is what the price is that you're paying at the pump.", "If you're paying less than you paid a year or two ago, why, then, the strategy is working.", "But you're paying more.", "When the president took office, the price of gasoline here in Nassau County was about $1.86 a gallon.", "Now, it's $4.00 a gallon.", "The price of electricity is up.", "If the president's energy policies are working, you're going to see the cost of energy come down.", "I will fight to create more energy in this country, to get America energy secure.", "And part of that is bringing in a pipeline of oil from Canada, taking advantage of the oil and coal we have here, drilling offshore in Alaska, drilling offshore in Virginia where the people want it.", "Those things will get us the energy we need.", " Well, think about what the governor -- think about what the governor just said.", "He said when I took office, the price of gasoline was $1.80, $1.86.", "Why is that?", "Because the economy was on the verge of collapse, because we were about to go through the worst recession since the Great Depression, as a consequence of some of the same policies that Governor Romney's now promoting.", "So, it's conceivable that Governor Romney could bring down gas prices because with his policies, we might be back in that same mess.", "What I want to do is to create an economy that is strong, and at the same time produce energy.", "And with respect to this pipeline that Governor Romney keeps on talking about, we've -- we've built enough pipeline to wrap around the entire earth once.", "So, I'm all for pipelines.", "I'm all for oil production.", "What I'm not for is us ignoring the other half of the equation.", "So, for example, on wind energy, when Governor Romney says \"these are imaginary jobs.\"", "When you've got thousands of people right now in Iowa, right now in Colorado, who are working, creating wind power with good-paying manufacturing jobs, and the Republican senator in that -- in Iowa is all for it, providing tax breaks (ph) to help this work and Governor Romney says I'm opposed.", "I'd get rid of it.", "That's not an energy strategy for the future.", "And we need to win that future.", "And I intend to win it as President of the United States.", " He gets the first --", " He actually got --", " He actually got the first question.", "So I get the last question -- last answer --", " Candy, Candy --", " Candy, I don't have a policy of stopping wind jobs in Iowa and that -- they're not phantom jobs.", "They're real jobs.", " I appreciate wind jobs in Iowa and across our country.", "I appreciate the jobs in coal and oil and gas.", "I'm going to make sure --", " -- we're taking advantage of our energy resources.", "We'll bring back manufacturing to America.", "We're going to get through a very aggressive energy policy, 31/2 million more jobs in this country.", "It's critical to our future.", " Candy, it's not going to --", " Used to being interrupted.", " Hi, Mary.", " You're doing great.", " Thank you very much.", "And let me tell you, you're absolutely right about part of that, which is I want to bring the rates down, I want to simplify the tax code, and I want to get middle- income taxpayers to have lower taxes.", "And the reason I want middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes is because middle-income taxpayers have been buried over the past four years.", "You've seen, as middle-income people in this country, incomes go down $4,300 a family, even as gasoline prices have gone up $2,000.", "Health insurance premiums, up $2,500.", "Food prices up.", "Utility prices up.", "The middle-income families in America have been crushed over the last four years.", "So I want to get some relief to middle-income families.", "That's part -- that's part one.", "Now, how about deductions?", "'Cause I'm going to bring rates down across the board for everybody, but I'm going to limit deductions and exemptions and credits, particularly for people at the high end, because I am not going to have people at the high end pay less than they're paying now.", "The top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation collects.", "So that'll stay the same.", "Middle-income people are going to get a tax break.", "And so, in terms of bringing down deductions, one way of doing that would be say everybody gets -- I'll pick a number -- $25,000 of deductions and credits, and you can decide which ones to use.", "Your home mortgage interest deduction, charity, child tax credit, and so forth, you can use those as part of filling that bucket, if you will, of deductions.", "But your rate comes down and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is every middle-income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains.", "No tax on your savings.", "That makes life a lot easier.", "If you're getting interest from a bank, if you're getting a statement from a mutual fund or any other kind of investment you have, you don't have to worry about filing taxes on that, because there'll be no taxes for anybody making $200,000.00 per year and less, on your interest, dividends and capital gains.", "Why am I lowering taxes on the middle-class?", "Because under the last four years, they've been buried.", "And I want to help people in the middle-class.", "And I will not -- I will not under any circumstances, reduce the share that's being paid by the highest income taxpayers.", "And I will not, under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle-class.", "The president's spending, the president's borrowing will cost this nation to have to raise taxes on the American people.", "Not just at the high end.", "A recent study has shown the people in the middle-class will see $4,000.00 per year in higher taxes as a result of the spending and borrowing of this administration.", "I will not let that happen.", "I want to get us on track to a balanced budget, and I'm going to reduce the tax burden on middle income families.", "And what's that going to do?", "It's going to help those families, and it's going to create incentives to start growing jobs again in this country.", " My philosophy on taxes has been simple.", "And that is, I want to give middle-class families and folks who are striving to get into the middle-class some relief.", "Because they have been hit hard over the last decade.", "Over the last 15, over the last 20 years.", "So four years ago I stood on a stage just like this one.", "Actually it was a town hall, and I said I would cut taxes for middle- class families, and that's what I've done, by $3,600.00.", "I said I would cut taxes for small businesses, who are the drivers and engines of growth.", "And we've cut them 18 times.", "And I want to continue those tax cuts for middle-class families, and for small business.", "But what I've also said is, if we're serious about reducing the deficit, if this is genuinely a moral obligation to the next generation, then in addition to some tough spending cuts, we've also got to make sure that the wealthy do a little bit more.", "So what I've said is, your first $250,000.00 worth of income, no change.", "And that means 98 percent of American families, 97 percent of small businesses, they will not see a tax increase.", "I'm ready to sign that bill right now.", "The only reason it's not happening is because Governor Romney's allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent.", "But what I've also says is for above $250,000, we can go back to the tax rates we had when Bill Clinton was president.", "We created 23 million new jobs.", "That's part of what took us from deficits to surplus.", "It will be good for our economy and it will be good for job creation.", "Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy.", "He was on 60 Minutes just two weeks ago and he was asked: Is it fair for somebody like you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody making $50,000 year?", "And he said, \"Yes, I think that's fair.\"", "Not only that, he said, \"I think that's what grows the economy.\"", "Well, I fundamentally disagree with that.", "I think what grows the economy is when you get that tax credit that we put in place for your kids going to college.", "I think that grows the economy.", "I think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country.", "That grows our economy.", "So we just have a different theory.", "And when Governor Romney stands here, after a year of campaigning, when during a Republican primary he stood on stage and said \"I'm going to give tax cuts\" -- he didn't say tax rate cuts, he said \"tax cuts to everybody,\" including the top 1 percent, you should believe him because that's been his history.", "And that's exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that's striving for everybody.", " You're absolutely right.", "You heard what I said about my tax plan.", "The top 5 percent will continue to pay 60 percent, as they do today.", "I'm not looking to cut taxes for wealthy people.", "I am looking to cut taxes for middle-income people.", "And why do I want to bring rates down, and at the same time lower exemptions and deductions, particularly for people at the high end?", "Because if you bring rates down, it makes it easier for small business to keep more of their capital and hire people.", "And for me, this is about jobs.", "I want to get America's economy going again.", "Fifty-four percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed as individuals.", "So when you bring those rates down, those small businesses are able to keep more money and hire more people.", "For me, I look at what's happened in the last four years and say this has been a disappointment.", "We can do better than this.", "We don't have to settle for, how many months, 43 months with unemployment above 8 percent, 23 million Americans struggling to find a good job right now.", "There are 3.5 million more women living in poverty today than when the president took office.", "We don't have to live like this.", "We can get this economy going again.", "My five-point plan does it.", "Energy independence for North America in five years.", "Opening up more trade, particularly in Latin America.", "Cracking down on China when they cheat.", "Getting us to a balanced budget.", "Fixing our training programs for our workers.", "And finally, championing small business.", "I want to make small businesses grow and thrive.", "I know how to make that happen.", "I spent my life in the private sector.", "I know why jobs come and why they go.", "And they're going now because of the policies of this administration.", " No, it's not settled.", "Look, the cost of lowering rates for everybody across the board, 20 percent.", "Along with what he also wants to do in terms of eliminating the estate tax, along what he wants to do in terms of corporates, changes in the tax code, it costs about $5 trillion.", "Governor Romney then also wants to spend $2 trillion on additional military programs even though the military's not asking for them.", "That's $7 trillion.", "He also wants to continue the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.", "That's another trillion dollars -- that's $8 trillion.", "Now, what he says is he's going to make sure that this doesn't add to the deficit and he's going to cut middleclass taxes.", "But when he's asked, how are you going to do it, which deductions, which loopholes are you going to close?", "He can't tell you.", "The -- the fact that he only has to pay 14 percent on his taxes when a lot of you are paying much higher.", "He's already taken that off the board, capital gains are going to continue to be at a low rate so we -- we're not going to get money that way.", "We haven't heard from the governor any specifics beyond Big Bird and eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood in terms of how he pays for that.", "Now, Governor Romney was a very successful investor.", "If somebody came to you, Governor, with a plan that said, here, I want to spend $7 or $8 trillion, and then we're going to pay for it, but we can't tell you until maybe after the election how we're going to do it, you wouldn't take such a sketchy deal and neither should you, the American people, because the math doesn't add up.", "And -- and what's at stake here is one of two things, either Candy -- this blows up the deficit because keep in mind, this is just to pay for the additional spending that he's talking about, $7 trillion - $8 trillion before we even get to the deficit we already have.", "Or, alternatively, it's got to be paid for, not only by closing deductions for wealthy individuals, that -- that will pay for about 4 percent reduction in tax rates.", "You're going to be paying for it.", "You're going to lose some deductions, and you can't buy the sales pitch.", "Nobody who's looked at it that's serious, actually believes it adds up.", " I -- I...", " Well of course they add up.", "I -- I was -- I was someone who ran businesses for 25 years, and balanced the budget.", "I ran the Olympics and balanced the budget.", "I ran the -- the state of Massachusetts as a governor, to the extent any governor does, and balanced the budget all four years.", "When we're talking about math that doesn't add up, how about $4 trillion of deficits over the last four years, $5 trillion?", "That's math that doesn't add up.", "We have -- we have a president talking about someone's plan in a way that's completely foreign to what my real plan is.", " And then we have his own record, which is we have four consecutive years where he said when he was running for office, he would cut the deficit in half.", "Instead he's doubled it.", "We've gone from $10 trillion of national debt, to $16 trillion of national debt.", "If the president were reelected, we'd go to almost $20 trillion of national debt.", "This puts us on a road to Greece.", "I know what it takes to balance budgets.", "I've done it my entire life.", "So for instance when he says, \"Yours is a $5 trillion cut.\"", "Well, no it's not.", "Because I'm offsetting some of the reductions with holding down some of the deductions.", "And...", " And I just described -- I just described to you, Mr. President -- I just described to you precisely how I'd do it which is with a single number that people can put -- and they can put they're -- they're deductions and credits... (CROSSTALK)", " Great.", "Looking forward to it.", "And it's Katherine Fenton, who has a question for you.", " Well, Katherine, that's a great question.", "And, you know, I was raised by a single mom who had to put herself through school while looking after two kids.", "And she worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we got everything we needed.", "My grandmother, she started off as a secretary in a bank.", "She never got a college education, even though she was smart as a whip.", "And she worked her way up to become a vice president of a local bank, but she hit the glass ceiling.", "She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career.", "She didn't complain.", "That's not what you did in that generation.", "And this is one of the reasons why one of the first -- the first bill I signed was something called the Lily Ledbetter bill.", "And it's named after this amazing woman who had been doing the same job as a man for years, found out that she was getting paid less, and the Supreme Court said that she couldn't bring suit because she should have found about it earlier, whereas she had no way of finding out about it.", "So we fixed that.", "And that's an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family.", "This is not just a women's issue, this is a family issue, this is a middle-class issue, and that's why we've got to fight for it.", "It also means that we've got to make sure that young people like yourself are able to afford a college education.", "Earlier, Governor Romney talked about he wants to make Pell Grants and other education accessible for young people.", "Well, the truth of the matter is, is that that's exactly what we've done.", "We've expanded Pell Grants for millions of people, including millions of young women, all across the country.", "We did it by taking $60 billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, and we said, let's just cut out the middleman.", "Let's give the money directly to students.", "And as a consequence, we've seen millions of young people be able to afford college, and that's going to make sure that young women are going to be able to compete in that marketplace.", "But we've got to enforce the laws, which is what we are doing, and we've also got to make sure that in every walk of life we do not tolerate discrimination.", "That's been one of the hallmarks of my administration.", "I'm going to continue to push on this issue for the next four years.", " Thank you.", "And important topic, and one which I learned a great deal about, particularly as I was serving as governor of my state, because I had the chance to pull together a cabinet and all the applicants seemed to be men.", "And I -- and I went to my staff, and I said, \"How come all the people for these jobs are -- are all men.\"", "They said, \"Well, these are the people that have the qualifications.\"", "And I said, \"Well, gosh, can't we -- can't we find some -- some women that are also qualified?\"", " And -- and so we -- we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet.", "I went to a number of women's groups and said, \"Can you help us find folks,\" and they brought us whole binders full of women.", "I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America.", "Now one of the reasons I was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort.", "But number two, because I recognized that if you're going to have women in the workforce that sometimes you need to be more flexible.", "My chief of staff, for instance, had two kids that were still in school.", "She said, I can't be here until 7 or 8 o'clock at night.", "I need to be able to get home at 5 o'clock so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school.", "So we said fine.", "Let's have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you.", "We're going to have to have employers in the new economy, in the economy I'm going to bring to play, that are going to be so anxious to get good workers they're going to be anxious to hire women.", "In the -- in the last women have lost 580,000 jobs.", "That's the net of what's happened in the last four years.", "We're still down 580,000 jobs.", "I mentioned 31/2 million women, more now in poverty than four years ago.", "What we can do to help young women and women of all ages is to have a strong economy, so strong that employers that are looking to find good employees and bringing them into their workforce and adapting to a flexible work schedule that gives women opportunities that they would otherwise not be able to afford.", "This is what I have done.", "It's what I look forward to doing and I know what it takes to make an economy work, and I know what a working economy looks like.", "And an economy with 7.8 percent unemployment is not a real strong economy.", "An economy that has 23 million people looking for work is not a strong economy.", "An economy with 50 percent of kids graduating from college that can't finds a job, or a college level job, that's not what we have to have.", " Governor?", " I'm going to help women in America get good work by getting a stronger economy and by supporting women in the workforce.", " Katherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it?", "He said, \"I'll get back to you.\"", "And that's not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy.", "Now, there are some other issues that have a bearing on how women succeed in the workplace.", "For example, their healthcare.", "You know a major difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making.", "I think that's a mistake.", "In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured.", "Because this is not just a -- a health issue, it's an economic issue for women.", "It makes a difference.", "This is money out of that family's pocket.", "Governor Romney not only opposed it, he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.", "That's not the kind of advocacy that women need.", "When Governor Romney says that we should eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, there are millions of women all across the country, who rely on Planned Parenthood for, not just contraceptive care, they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings.", "That's a pocketbook issue for women and families all across the country.", "And it makes a difference in terms of how well and effectively women are able to work.", "When we talk about child care, and the credits that we're providing.", "That makes a difference in whether they can go out there and -- and earn a living for their family.", "These are not just women's issues.", "These are family issues.", "These are economic issues.", "And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same fair deal as men are.", " And I've got two daughters and I want to make sure that they have the same opportunities that anybody's sons have.", "That's part of what I'm fighting for as president of the United States.", " Thank you.", "And I appreciate that question.", "I just want to make sure that, I think I was supposed to get that last answer, but I want to point out that that I don't believe...", " I don't think so, Candy.", " ...", "I don't believe...", " I want to make sure our timekeepers are working here.", " The time -- the time...", " I'd just note that I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not.", "And I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care of not.", "Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives.", "And -- and the -- and the president's statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong.", " Governor...", " Let me come back and -- and answer your question.", "President Bush and I are -- are different people and these are different times and that's why my five point plan is so different than what he would have done.", "I mean for instance, we can now, by virtue of new technology actually get all the energy we need in North America without having to go to the -- the Arabs or the Venezuelans or anyone else.", "That wasn't true in his time, that's why my policy starts with a very robust policy to get all that energy in North America -- become energy secure.", "Number two, trade -- I'll crack down on China, President Bush didn't.", "I'm also going to dramatically expand trade in Latin America.", "It's been growing about 12 percent per year over a long period of time.", "I want to add more free trade agreements so we'll have more trade.", "Number three, I'm going to get us to a balanced budget.", "President Bush didn't.", "President Obama was right, he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years.", "He was right, but then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four years.", "And his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large.", "So that's the next area I'm different than President Bush.", "And then let's take the last one, championing small business.", "Our party has been focused too long.", "I came through small business.", "I understand how hard it is to start a small business.", "That's why everything I'll do is designed to help small businesses grow and add jobs.", "I want to keep their taxes down on small business.", "I want regulators to see their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it.", "And the thing I find the most troubling about Obama Care, well it's a long list, but one of the things I find most troubling is that when you go out and talk to small businesses and ask them what they think about it, they tell you it keeps them from hiring more people.", "My priority is jobs.", "I know how to make that happen.", "And President Bush has a very different path for a very different time.", "My path is designed in getting small businesses to grow and hire people.", " Well, first of all, I think it's important to tell you that we did come in during some tough times.", "We were losing 800,000 jobs a month when I started.", "But we had been digging our way out of policies that were misplaced and focused on the top doing very well and middle class folks not doing well.", "Now, we've seen 30 consecutive -- 31 consecutive months of job growth; 5.2 million new jobs created.", "And the plans that I talked about will create even more.", "But when Governor Romney says that he has a very different economic plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan are tax cuts.", "That's what took us from surplus to deficit.", "When he talks about getting tough on China, keep in mind that Governor Romney invested in companies that were pioneers of outsourcing to China, and is currently investing in countries -- in companies that are building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks.", "That's -- Governor, you're the last person who's going to get tough on China.", "And what we've done when it comes to trade is not only sign three trade deals to open up new markets, but we've also set up a task force for trade that goes after anybody who is taking advantage of American workers or businesses and not creating a level playing field.", "We've brought twice as many cases against unfair trading practices than the previous administration and we've won every single one that's been decided.", "When I said that we had to make sure that China was not flooding our domestic market with cheap tires, Governor Romney said I was being protectionist; that it wouldn't be helpful to American workers.", "Well, in fact we saved 1,000 jobs.", "And that's the kind of tough trade actions that are required.", "But the last point I want to make is this.", "You know, there are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush.", "George Bush didn't propose turning Medicare into a voucher.", "George Bush embraced comprehensive immigration reform.", "He didn't call for self-deportation.", "George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, so there are differences between Governor Romney and George Bush, but they're not on economic policy.", "In some ways, he's gone to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy.", "And I think that's a mistake.", "That's not how we're going to move our economy forward.", " Well, we've gone through a tough four years.", "There's no doubt about it.", "But four years ago, I told the American people and I told you I would cut taxes for middle class families.", "And I did.", "I told you I'd cut taxes for small businesses, and I have.", "I said that I'd end the war in Iraq, and I did.", "I said we'd refocus attention on those who actually attacked us on 9/11, and we have gone after Al Qaeda's leadership like never before and Osama bin Laden is dead.", " I said that we would put in place health care reform to make sure that insurance companies can't jerk you around and if you don't have health insurance, that you'd have a chance to get affordable insurance, and I have.", "I committed that I would rein in the excesses of Wall Street, and we passed the toughest Wall Street reforms since the 1930s.", "We've created five million jobs, and gone from 800 jobs a month being lost, and we are making progress.", "We saved an auto industry that was on the brink of collapse.", "Now, does that mean you're not struggling?", "Absolutely not.", "A lot of us are.", "And that's why the plan that I've put forward for manufacturing and education, and reducing our deficit in a sensible way, using the savings from ending wars, to rebuild America and putting people back to work.", "Making sure that we are controlling our own energy, but not only the energy of today, but also the energy of the future.", "All of those things will make a difference, so the point is the commitments I've made, I've kept.", "And those that I haven't been able to keep, it's not for lack of trying and we're going to get it done in a second term.", "But, you should pay attention to this campaign, because Governor Romney has made some commitments as well.", "And I suspect he'll keep those too.", "You know when members of the Republican Congress say, \"We're going to sign a no tax pledge, so that we don't ask a dime for millionaires and billionaires to reduce our deficit so we can still invest in education, and helping kids go to college.", "He said, \"Me too.\"", "When they said, \"We're going to cut Planned Parenthood funding.\"", "He said, \"Me too.\"", "When he said, \"We're going to repeal Obamacare.", "First thing I'm going to do,\" despite the fact that it's the same health care plan that he passed in Massachusetts and is working well.", "He said, \"Me too.\"", "That is not the kind of leadership that you need, but you should expect that those are promises he's going to keep.", "(CROSSTALK)", " ...the choice in this election is going to be whose promises are going to be more likely to help you in your life?", "Make sure your kids can go to college.", "Make sure that you are getting a good paying job, making sure that Medicare and Social Security...

your confident that the next four years are going to be much better either.", "I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what you're going to get.", "You're going to get a repeat of the last four years.", "We just can't afford four more years like the last four years.", "He said that by now we'd have unemployment at 5.4 percent.", "The difference between where it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million Americans without work.", "I wasn't the one that said 5.4 percent.", "This was the president's plan.", "Didn't get there.", "He said he would have by now put forward a plan to reform Medicare and Social Security, because he pointed out they're on the road to bankruptcy.", "He would reform them.", "He'd get that done.", "He hasn't even made a proposal on either one.", "He said in his first year he'd put out an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges.", "Didn't even file it.", "This is a president who has not been able to do what he said he'd do.", "He said that he'd cut in half the deficit.", "He hasn't done that either.", "In fact, he doubled it.", "He said that by now middle-income families would have a reduction in their health insurance premiums by $2,500 a year.", "It's gone up by $2,500 a year.", "And if Obamacare is passed, or implemented -- it's already been passed -- if it's implemented fully, it'll be another $2,500 on top.", " The middle class is getting crushed under the policies of a president who has not understood what it takes to get the economy working again.", "He keeps saying, \"Look, I've created 5 million jobs.\"", "That's after losing 5 million jobs.", "The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country.", "The unemployment, the number of people who are still looking for work, is still 23 million Americans.", "There are more people in poverty, one out of six people in poverty.", "How about food stamps?", "When he took office, 32 million people were on food stamps.", "Today, 47 million people are on food stamps.", "How about the growth of the economy?", "It's growing more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before.", "The president wants to do well.", "I understand.", "But the policies he's put in place from Obamacare to Dodd-Frank to his tax policies to his regulatory policies, these policies combined have not let this economy take off and grow like it could have.", "You might say, \"Well, you got an example of one that worked better?\"", "Yeah, in the Reagan recession where unemployment hit 10.8 percent, between that period -- the end of that recession and the equivalent of time to today, Ronald Reagan's recovery created twice as many jobs as this president's recovery.", "Five million jobs doesn't even keep up with our population growth.", "And the only reason the unemployment rate seems a little lower today is because of all the people that have dropped out of the workforce.", "The president has tried, but his policies haven't worked.", "He's great as a -- as a -- as a speaker and describing his plans and his vision.", "That's wonderful, except we have a record to look at.", "And that record shows he just hasn't been able to cut the deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare and Social Security to preserve them, to get us the rising incomes we need.", "Median income is down $4,300 a family and 23 million Americans out of work.", "That's what this election is about.", "It's about who can get the middle class in this country a bright and prosperous future and assure our kids the kind of hope and optimism they deserve.", " This is for Governor Romney?", " Is it Loraina?", " Lorraine?", " Lorraine.", " Good, thanks.", " Thank you.", "Lorraine?", "Did I get that right?", "Good.", "Thank you for your question.", "And let me step back and tell you what I would like to do with our immigration policy broadly and include an answer to your question.", "But first of all, this is a nation of immigrants.", "We welcome people coming to this country as immigrants.", "My dad was born in Mexico of American parents; Ann's dad was born in Wales and is a first-generation American.", "We welcome legal immigrants into this country.", "I want our legal system to work better.", "I want it to be streamlined.", "I want it to be clearer.", "I don't think you have to -- shouldn't have to hire a lawyer to figure out how to get into this country legally.", "I also think that we should give visas to people -- green cards, rather, to people who graduate with skills that we need.", "People around the world with accredited degrees in science and math get a green card stapled to their diploma, come to the U.S. of A.", "We should make sure our legal system works.", "Number two, we're going to have to stop illegal immigration.", "There are 4 million people who are waiting in line to get here legally.", "Those who've come here illegally take their place.", "So I will not grant amnesty to those who have come here illegally.", "What I will do is I'll put in place an employment verification system and make sure that employers that hire people who have come here illegally are sanctioned for doing so.", "I won't put in place magnets for people coming here illegally.", "So for instance, I would not give driver's licenses to those that have come here illegally as the president would.", "The kids of those that came here illegally, those kids, I think, should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United States and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident.", " Now when the president ran for office, he said that he'd put in place, in his first year, a piece of legislation -- he'd file a bill in his first year that would reform our -- our immigration system, protect legal immigration, stop illegal immigration.", "He didn't do it.", "He had a Democrat House, a Democrat Senate, super majority in both Houses.", "Why did he fail to even promote legislation that would have provided an answer for those that want to come legally and for those that are here illegally today?", "What's a question I think the -- the president will have a chance to answer right now.", " Good, I look forward to it.", "Was -- Lorranna -- Lorraine -- we are a nation of immigrants.", "I mean we're just a few miles away from Ellis Island.", "We all understand what this country has become because talent from all around the world wants to come here.", "People are willing to take risks.", "People who want to build on their dreams and make sure their kids have an even bigger dreams than they have.", "But we're also a nation of laws.", "So what I've said is we need to fix a broken immigration system and I've done everything that I can on my own and sought cooperation from Congress to make sure that we fix the system.", "The first thing we did was to streamline the legal immigration system, to reduce the backlog, make it easier, simpler and cheaper for people who are waiting in line, obeying the law to make sure that they can come here and contribute to our country and that's good for our economic growth.", "They'll start new businesses.", "They'll make things happen to create jobs here in the United States.", "Number two, we do have to deal with our border so we put more border patrol on the -- any time in history and the flow of undocumented works across the border is actually lower than it's been in 40 years.", "What I've also said is if we're going to go after folks who are here illegally, we should do it smartly and go after folks who are criminals, gang bangers, people who are hurting the community, not after students, not after folks who are here just because they're trying to figure out how to feed their families.", "And that's what we've done.", "And what I've also said is for young people who come here, brought here often times by their parents.", "Had gone to school here, pledged allegiance to the flag.", "Think of this as their country.", "Understand themselves as Americans in every way except having papers.", "And we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship.", "And that's what I've done administratively.", "Now, Governor Romney just said, you know he wants to help those young people too, but during the Republican primary, he said, \"I will veto the DREAM Act\", that would allow these young people to have access.\"", "His main strategy during the Republican primary was to say, \"We're going to encourage self-deportation.\"", "Making life so miserable on folks that they'll leave.", "He called the Arizona law a model for the nation.", "Part of the Arizona law said that law enforcement officers could stop folks because they suspected maybe they looked like they might be undocumented workers and check their papers.", "You know what?", "If my daughter or yours looks to somebody like they're not a citizen, I don't want -- I don't want to empower somebody like that.", "So, we can fix this system in a comprehensive way.", "And when Governor Romney says, the challenge is, \"Well Obama didn't try.\"", "That's not true.", "I have sat down with Democrats and Republicans at the beginning of my term.", "And I said, let's fix this system.", "Including Senators previously who had supported it on the Republican side.", "But it's very hard for Republican's in Congress to support comprehensive immigration reform, if their standard bearer has said that, this is not something I'm interested in supporting.", " Yes.", " No, let -- let -- let me go back and speak to the points that the president made and -- and -- and let's get them correct.", "I did not say that the Arizona law was a model for the nation in that aspect.", "I said that the E-Verify portion of the Arizona law, which is -- which is the portion of the law which says that employers could be able to determine whether someone is here illegally or not illegally, that that was a model for the nation.", "That's number one.", "Number two, I asked the president a question I think Hispanics and immigrants all over the nation have asked.", "He was asked this on Univision the other day.", "Why, when you said you'd filed legislation in your first year didn't you do it?", "And he didn't answer.", "He -- he doesn't answer that question.", "He said the standard bearer wasn't for it.", "I'm glad you thought I was a standard bearer four years ago, but I wasn't.", "Four years ago you said in your first year you would file legislation.", "In his first year, I was just getting -- licking my wounds from having been beaten by John McCain, all right.", "I was not the standard bearer.", "My -- my view is that this president should have honored his promise to do as he said.", "Now, let me mention one other thing, and that is self-deportation says let people make their own choice.", "What I was saying is, we're not going to round up 12 million people, undocumented illegals, and take them out of the nation.", "Instead let people make their own choice.", "And if they -- if they find that -- that they can't get the benefits here that they want and they can't -- and they can't find the job they want, then they'll make a decision to go a place where -- where they have better opportunities.", "But I'm not in favor of rounding up people and -- and -- and taking them out of this country.", "I am in favor, as the president has said, and I agree with him, which is that if people have committed crimes we got to get them out of this country.", " Let me mention something else the president said.", "It was a moment ago and I didn't get a chance to, when he was describing Chinese investments and so forth.", " Candy?", "Hold on a second.", "The...", " Mr. President, I'm still speaking.", "(CROSSTALK)", " Mr. President, let me finish.", "(CROSSTALK)", " I've gotta continue.", "(CROSSTALK)", " Just going to make a point.", "Any investments I have over the last eight years have been managed by a blind trust.", "And I understand they do include investments outside the United States, including in -- in Chinese companies.", "Mr. President, have you looked at your pension?", "Have you looked at your pension?", " I've got to say...", " Mr. President, have you looked at your pension?", " You know, I -- I don't look at my pension.", "It's not as big as yours so it doesn't take as long.", " Well, let me give you some advice.", " I don't check it that often.", " Let me give you some advice.", "Look at your pension.", "You also have investments in Chinese companies.", "You also have investments outside the United States.", "You also have investments through a Cayman's trust.", "(CROSSTALK)", " I thought we were talking about immigration.", "(CROSSTALK)", " I do want to make sure that...", " I do want to make sure that -- I do want to make sure that we just understand something.", "Governor Romney says he wasn't referring to Arizona as a model for the nation.", "His top adviser on immigration is the guy who designed the Arizona law, the entirety of it; not E-Verify, the whole thing.", "That's his policy.", "And it's a bad policy.", "And it won't help us grow.", "Look, when we think about immigration, we have to understand there are folks all around the world who still see America as the land of promise.", "And they provide us energy and they provide us innovation and they start companies like Intel and Google.", "And we want to encourage that.", "Now, we've got to make sure that we do it in a smart way and a comprehensive way, and we make the legal system better.", "But when we make this into a divisive political issue, and when we don't have bipartisan support -- I can deliver, Governor, a whole bunch of Democrats to get comprehensive immigration reform done, and we can't...", " I'll get it done.", "I'll get it done.", "First year...", " ... we can't -- we have not seen Republicans serious about this issue at all.", "And it's time for them to get serious on it.", " This used to be a bipartisan issue.", "(CROSSTALK)", " OK. Hi, Kerry.", " I'm sorry.", "What's your name?", " Great to see you.", " Ah.", " Well, let me first of all talk about our diplomats, because they serve all around the world and do an incredible job in a very dangerous situation.", "And these aren't just representatives of the United States, they are my representatives.", "I send them there, oftentimes into harm's way.", "I know these folks and I know their families.", "So nobody is more concerned about their safety and security than I am.", "So as soon as we found out that the Benghazi consulate was being overrun, I was on the phone with my national security team and I gave them three instructions.", "Number one, beef up our security and procedures, not just in Libya, but at every embassy and consulate in the region.", "Number two, investigate exactly what happened, regardless of where the facts lead us, to make sure folks are held accountable and it doesn't happen again.", "And number three, we are going to find out who did this and we're going to hunt them down, because one of the things that I've said throughout my presidency is when folks mess with Americans, we go after them.", " Now Governor Romney had a very different response.", "While we were still dealing with our diplomats being threatened, Governor Romney put out a press release, trying to make political points, and that's not how a commander in chief operates.", "You don't turn national security into a political issue.", "Certainly not right when it's happening.", "And people -- not everybody agrees with some of the decisions I've made.", "But when it comes to our national security, I mean what I say.", "I said I'd end the war in Libya -- in -- in Iraq, and I did.", "I said that we'd go after al-Qaeda and bin Laden, we have.", "I said we'd transition out of Afghanistan, and start making sure that Afghans are responsible for their own security, that's what I'm doing.", "And when it comes to this issue, when I say that we are going to find out exactly what happened, everybody will be held accountable.", "And I am ultimately responsible for what's taking place there because these are my folks, and I'm the one who has to greet those coffins when they come home.", "You know that I mean what I say.", " Thank you Kerry for your question, it's an important one.", "And -- and I -- I think the president just said correctly that the buck does stop at his desk and -- and he takes responsibility for -- for that -- for the failure in providing those security resources, and -- and those terrible things may well happen from time to time.", "I -- I'm -- I feel very deeply sympathetic for the families of those who lost loved ones.", "And today there's a memorial service for one of those that was lost in this tragedy.", "We -- we think of their families and care for them deeply.", "There were other issues associated with this -- with this tragedy.", "There were many days that passed before we knew whether this was a spontaneous demonstration, or actually whether it was a terrorist attack.", " And there was no demonstration involved.", "It was a terrorist attack and it took a long time for that to be told to the American people.", "Whether there was some misleading, or instead whether we just didn't know what happened, you have to ask yourself why didn't we know five days later when the ambassador to the United Nations went on TV to say that this was a demonstration.", "How could we have not known?", "But I find more troubling than this, that on -- on the day following the assassination of the United States ambassador, the first time that's happened since 1979, when -- when we have four Americans killed there, when apparently we didn't know what happened, that the president, the day after that happened, flies to Las Vegas for a political fund-raiser, then the next day to Colorado for another event, other political event.", "I think these -- these actions taken by a president and a leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even material significance in that you'd hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses.", "We've read their accounts now about what happened.", "It was very clear this was not a demonstration.", "This was an attack by terrorists.", "And this calls into question the president's whole policy in the Middle East.", "Look what's happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya.", "Consider the distance between ourselves and -- and Israel, the president said that -- that he was going to put daylight between us and Israel.", "We have Iran four years closer to a nuclear bomb.", "Syria -- Syria's not just a tragedy of 30,000 civilians being killed by a military, but also a strategic -- strategically significant player for America.", "The president's policies throughout the Middle East began with an apology tour and -- and -- and pursue a strategy of leading from behind, and this strategy is unraveling before our very eyes.", " Secretary Clinton has done an extraordinary job.", "But she works for me.", "I'm the president and I'm always responsible, and that's why nobody's more interested in finding out exactly what happened than I do.", "The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people in the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened.", "That this was an act of terror and I also said that we're going to hunt down those who committed this crime.", "And then a few days later, I was there greeting the caskets coming into Andrews Air Force Base and grieving with the families.", "And the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the Secretary of State, our U.N.", "Ambassador, anybody on my team would play politics or mislead when we've lost four of our own, governor, is offensive.", "That's not what we do.", "That's not what I do as president, that's not what I do as Commander in Chief.", " Yes, I -- I...", " I -- I think interesting the president just said something which -- which is that on the day after the attack he went into the Rose Garden and said that this was an act of terror.", " That's what I said.", " You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack, it was an act of terror.", "It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is that what you're saying?", " Please proceed governor.", " I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.", " Get the transcript.", " Can you say that a little louder, Candy?", " This -- the administration -- the administration indicated this was a reaction to a video and was a spontaneous reaction.", " It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group.", "And to suggest -- am I incorrect in that regard, on Sunday, the -- your secretary --", " Candy?", " Excuse me.", "The ambassador of the United Nations went on the Sunday television shows and spoke about how --", " Candy, I'm --", " -- this was a spontaneous --", " I'm happy to have a longer conversation --", " -- about foreign policy.", " OK.", "I'm happy to do that, too.", " I just want to make sure that --", " -- all of these wonderful folks are going to have a chance to get some of their questions answered.", " We're a nation that believes in the Second Amendment, and I believe in the Second Amendment.", "We've got a long tradition of hunting and sportsmen and people who want to make sure they can protect themselves.", "But there have been too many instances during the course of my presidency, where I've had to comfort families who have lost somebody.", "Most recently out in Aurora.", "You know, just a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably about a month, I saw a mother, who I had met at the bedside of her son, who had been shot in that theater.", "And her son had been shot through the head.", "And we spent some time, and we said a prayer and, remarkably, about two months later, this young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable, good as new.", "But there were a lot of families who didn't have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands didn't survive.", "So my belief is that, (A), we have to enforce the laws we've already got, make sure that we're keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill. We've done a much better job in terms of background checks, but we've got more to do when it comes to enforcement.", "But I also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters don't belong on our streets.", "And so what I'm trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally.", "Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced.", "But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence.", "Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there's an awful lot of violence and they're not using AK-47s.", "They're using cheap hand guns.", "And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that our schools are working; that if there's violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control.", "And so what I want is a -- is a comprehensive strategy.", "Part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.", "But part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur.", " Yeah, I'm not in favor of new pieces of legislation on -- on guns and taking guns away or making certain guns illegal.", "We, of course, don't want to have automatic weapons, and that's already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons.", "What I believe is we have to do, as the president mentioned towards the end of his remarks there, which is to make enormous efforts to enforce the gun laws that we have, and to change the culture of violence that we have.", "And you ask how -- how are we going to do that?", "And there are a number of things.", "He mentioned good schools.", "I totally agree.", "We were able to drive our schools to be number one in the nation in my state.", "And I believe if we do a better job

indicate the course of action and the weapons he would use in the event of such an attack.", " in the event that such an attack occurred and in the event the attack was a prelude to an attack on Formosa - which would be the indication today because the Chinese Communists say over and over again that their objective is not the offshore islands, that they consider them only steppingstones to taking Formosa - in the event that their attack then were a prelude to an attack on Formosa, there isn't any question but that the United States would then again, as in the case of Berlin, honor our treaty obligations and stand by our ally of Formosa.", "But to indicate in advance how we would respond, to indicate the nature of this response would be incorrect; it would certainly be inappropriate; it would not be in the best interests of the United States.", "I will only say this, however, in addition: to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested - to suggest that we will surrender these islands or force our Chinese Nationalist allies to surrender them in advance - is not something that would lead to peace; it is something that would lead, in my opinion, to war.", "This is the

Mr. Nixon is discussing are five or four miles, respectively, off the coast of China.", "Now when Senator Green, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to the President, he

two islands.", "Mr. Nixon suggests uh - that the United States should go to war if these two islands are attacked.", "I suggest that if Formosa is attacked or the Pescadores, or if there's any military action in any area which indicates an attack on Formosa and the Pescadores, then of course the United States is at war to defend its treaty.", "Now, I must say what Mr. Nixon wants to do is commit us - as I understand him, so that we can be clear if there's a disagreement - he wants us to be committed to the defense of these islands merely as the defense of these islands as free territory, not as part of the defense of Formosa.", "Admiral Yarnell, the commander of the Asiatic fleet, has said that these islands are not worth the bones of a single American.", "The President of

we should move full time on our missile production, particularly on Minuteman and on Polaris.", "It may be a long period, but we must - we must get started immediately.", "Now on the question of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, I must say that I feel that another effort should be made by a new Administration in January of 1961, to renew negotiations with the Soviet Union and see whether it's possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chances of contamination of the atmosphere, and also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity.", "There are indications, because of new inventions, that ten, fifteen, or twenty nations will have a nuclear capacity - including Red China - by the end of the presidential office in 1964.", "This is extremely serious.", "There have been many wars in the history of mankind.", "And to take a chance uh - now be - and not make every effort that we could make to provide for some control over these weapons, I think would be a great mistake.", "One of my disagreements with the present Administration has been that I don't feel a real effort has been made an this very sensitive subject, not only of nuclear controls, but also of general disarmament.", "Less than a hundred people have been working throughout the entire federal government on this subject, and I believe it's been reflected in our success and failures at Geneva.", "Now, we may not succeed.", "The Soviet Union may not agree to an inspection system.", "We may be able to get satisfactory assurances.", "It may be necessary for us to begin testing again.", "But I hope the next Administration - and if I have anything to do with it, the next Administration will - make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels.", "These must be done.", "If we cannot succeed, then we must strengthen ourselves.", "But I would make the effort because I think the fate not only of our own civilization, but I think the fate of world and the future of the human race is involved in preventing a nuclear war.", " Yes.", "I am going to make a major speech on this whole subject next week before the next debate, and I will have an opportunity then to answer any other questions that may arise with regard to my position on it.", "There isn't any question but that we must move forward in every possible way to reduce the danger of war; to move toward controlled disarmament; to control tests; but also let's have in mind this: when Senator Kennedy suggests that we haven't been making an effort, he simply doesn't know what he's talking about.", "It isn't a question of the number of people who are working in an Administration.", "It's a question of who they are.", "This has been one of the highest level operations in the whole State Department right under the President himself.", "We have gone certainly the extra mile and then some in making offers to the Soviet Union on control of tests, on disarmament, and in every other way.", "And I just want to make one thing very clear.", "Yes, we should make a great effort.", "But under no circumstances must the United States ever make an agreement based on trust.", "There must be an absolute guarantee.", "Now, just a comment on Senator Kennedy's last answer.", "He forgets that in this same debate on the Formosa resolution, which he said he voted for - which he did - that he voted against an amendment, or was recorded against an amendment - and on this particular - or for an amendment, I should say - which passed the Senate overwhelmingly, seventy to twelve.", "And that amendment put the Senate of the United States on record with a majority of the Senator's own party voting for it, as well as the majority of Republicans - put them on record - against the very position that the Senator takes now of surrendering, of indicating in advance, that the United States will not defend the offshore islands.", " Well Mr. Drummond, first of all, referring to Secretary Dulles' press conference, I think if you read it all - and I know that you have - you will find that Secretary Dulles also indicated in that press conference that when the troops were withdrawn from Quemoy, that the implication was certainly of everything that he said, that Quemoy could better be defended.", "There were too many infantrymen there, not enough heavy artillery; and certainly I don't think there was any implication in Secretary Dulles' statement that Quemoy and Matsu should not be defended in the event that they were attacked, and that attack was a preliminary to an attack on Formosa.", "Now as far as President Eisenhower is concerned, I have often heard him discuss this question.", "As I uh - related a moment ago, the President has always indicated that we must not make the mistake in dealing with the dictator of indicating that we are going to make a concession at the point of a gun.", "Whenever you do that, inevitably the dictator is encouraged to try it again.", "So first it will be Quemoy and Matsu, next it may be Formosa.", "What do we do then?", " that once you do this - follow this course of action - of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return.", "And that means war.", "We went through this tragic experience leading to World War II.", "We learned our lesson again in Korea, We must not learn it again.", "That is why I think the Senate was right, including a majority of the Democrats, a majority of the Republicans, when they rejected Senator Kennedy's position in 1955.", "And incidentally, Senator Johnson was among those who rejected that position - voted with the seventy against the twelve.", "The Senate was right because they knew the lesson of history.", "And may I say, too, that I would trust that Senator Kennedy would change his position on this - change it; because as long as he as a major presidential candidate continues to suggest that we are going to turn over these islands, he is only encouraging the aggressors - the Chinese Communist and the Soviet aggressors - to press the United States, to press us to the point where war would be inevitable.", "The road to war is always paved with good intentions.", "And in this instance the good intentions, of course, are a desire for peace.", "But certainly we're not going to have peace by giving in and indicating in advance that we are not going to defend what has become a symbol of freedom.", " I don't think it's possible for Mr. Nixon to state the record in distortion of the facts with more precision than he just did.", "In 1955, Mr. Dulles at a press conference said: \"The treaty that we have with the Republic of China excludes Quemoy and Matsu from the treaty area.\"", "That was done with much thought and deliberation.", "Therefore that treaty does not commit the United States to defend anything except Formosa and the Pescadores, and to deal with acts against that treaty area.", "I completely sustained the treaty.", "I voted for it.", "I would take any action necessary to defend the treaty, Formosa, and the Pescadores Island.", "What we're now talking about is the Vice President's determination to guarantee Quemoy and Matsu, which are four and five miles off the coast of Red China, which are not within the treaty area.", "I do not suggest that Chiang Kai-shek - and this Administration has been attempting since 1955 to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to lessen his troop commitments.", "Uh - He sent a mission - the President - in 1955 of Mr. uh - Robertson and Admiral Radford.", "General Twining said they were still doing it in 1959.", "General Ridgway said - who was Chief of Staff: \"To go to war for Quemoy and Matsu to me would seem an unwarranted and tragic course to take.", "To me that concept is completely repugnant.\"", "So I stand with them.", "I stand with the Secretary of State, Mr. Herter, who said these islands were indefensible.", "I believe that we should meet our commitments, and if the Chinese Communists attack the Pescadores and Formosa, they know that it will mean a war.", "I would not ho- hand over these islands under any point of gun.", "But I merely say that the treaty is quite precise and I sustain the treaty.", "Mr. Nixon would add a guarantee to islands five miles off the coast of the re- Republic of China when he's never really protested the Communists seizing Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States.", " Well, I must say that uh - Mr. Truman has uh - his methods of expressing things; he's been in politics for fifty years; he's been president of the United States.", "They may - are not my style.", "But I really don't think there's anything that I could say to President Truman that's going to cause him, at the age of seventy-six, to change his particular speaking manner.", "Perhaps Mrs. Truman can, but I don't think I can.", "I'll just have to tell Mr. Morton that.", "If you'd pass that message on to him.", " Yes, I think so.", "Of course, both er - Senator Kennedy and I have felt Mr. Truman's ire; and uh - consequently, I think he can speak with some feeling on this subject.", "I just do want to say one thing, however.", "We all have tempers; I have one; I'm sure Senator Kennedy has one.", "But when a man's president of the United States, or a former president, he has an obligation not to lose his temper in public.", "One thing I've noted as I've traveled around the country are the tremendous number of children who come out to see the presidential candidates.", "I see mothers holding their babies up, so that they can see a man who might be president of the United States.", "I know Senator Kennedy sees them, too.", "It makes you realize that whoever is president is going to be a man that all the children of America will either look up to, or will look down to.", "And I can only say that I'm very proud that President Eisenhower restored dignity and decency and, frankly, good language to the conduct of the presidency of the United States.", "And I only hope that, should I win this election, that I could approach President Eisenhower in maintaining the dignity of the office; in seeing to it that whenever any mother or father talks to his child, he can look at the man in the White House and, whatever he may think of his policies, he will say: \"Well, there is a man who maintains the kind of standards personally that I would want my child to follow.\"", " Well, Mr. Cater, of course it's a criticism that uh - is being made.", "Uh - I obviously don't think it's valid.", "I have supported the Administration's position and I think that that position has been correct; I think my position has been correct.", "As far as Indochina was concerned, I stated over and over again that it was essential during that period that the United States make it clear that we would not tolerate Indochina falling under Communist domination.", "Now, as a result of our taking the strong stand that we did, the civil war there was ended; and today, at least in the south of Indochina, the Communists have moved out and we do have a strong, free bastion there.", "Now, looking to the U-2 flights, I would like to point out that I have been supporting the President's position throughout.", "I think the President was correct in ordering these flights.", "I think the President was correct, certainly, in his decision to continue the flights while the conference was going on.", "I noted, for example, in reading a - uh - a - a particular discussion that Senator Kennedy had with Dave Garroway shortly after the uh - his statement about regrets, that uh - he made the statement that he felt that these particular flights uh - were ones that shouldn't have occurred right at that time, and the indication was how would Mr. Khrushchev had felt if we had uh - had a flight over the uni- how would we have felt if Mr. Khrushchev ha - uh - had a flight over the United States while uh - he was visiting here.", "And the answer, of course, is that Communist espionage goes on all the time.", "The answer is that the United States can't afford to have a es- an es - a espionage lack or should we s- uh - lag - or should I say uh - an intelligence lag - any more than we can afford to have a missile lag.", "Now, referring to your question with regard to Quemoy and Matsu.", "What I object to here is the constant reference to surrendering these islands.", "Senator Kennedy quotes the record, which he read from a moment ago, but what he forgets to point out is that the key vote - a uh - vote which I've referred to several times - where he was in the minority was one which rejected his position.", "Now, why did they reject it?", "For the very reason that those Senators knew, as the President of the United States knew, that you should not indicate to the Communists in advance that you're going to surrender an area that's free.", "Why?", "Because they know as Senator Kennedy will have to know that if you do that you encourage them to more aggression.", " Well number one on Indochina, Mr. Nixon talked in - before the newspaper editors in the spring of 1954 about putting, and I quote him, \"American boys into Indochina.\"", "The reason Indochina was preserved was the result of the Geneva Conference which Indochina.", "Number two, on the question of the U-2 flights.", "I thought the.", "U-2 flight in May just before the conference was a mistake in timing because of the hazards involved, if the summit conference had any hope for success.", "I never criticized the U-2 flights in general, however.", "I never suggested espionage should stop.", "It still goes on, I would assume, on both sides.", "Number three, the Vice President - on May fifteenth after the U-2 flight - indicated that the flights were going on, even though the Administration and the President had canceled the flights on May twelfth.", "Number three, the pre - Vice President suggests that we should keep the Communists in doubt about whether we would fight on Quemoy and Matsu.", "That's not the position he's taking.", "He's indicating that we should fight for these islands come what may because they are, in his words, in the area of freedom.", "He didn't take that position on Tibet.", "He didn't take that position on Budapest.", "He doesn't take that position that I've seen so far in Laos.", "Guinea and Ghana have both moved within the Soviet sphere of influence in foreign policy; so has Cuba.", "I merely say that the United States should meet its commitments to Que- to uh - Formosa and the Pescadores.", "But as Admiral Yarnell has said, and he's been supported by most military authority, these islands that we're now talking about are not worth the bones of a single American soldier; and I know how difficult it is to sustain troops close to the shore under artillery bombardment.", "And therefore, I think, we should make it very clear the disagreement between Mr. Nixon and myself.", "He's extending the Administration's commitment.", " Well the que- the - Mr. Griffin, I believe, who is the head of the Klan, who lives in Tampa, Florida, indicated a - in a statement, I think, two or three weeks ago that he was not going to vote for me, and that he was going to vote for Mr. Nixon.", "I do not suggest in any way, nor have I ever, that that indicates that Mr. Nixon has the slightest sympathy, involvement, or in any way imply any inferences in regard to the Ku Klux Klan.", "That's absurd.", "I don't suggest that, I don't support it.", "I would disagree with it.", "Mr. Nixon knows very well that in this - in this whole matter that's been involved with the so-called religious discussion in this campaign, I've never suggested, even by the vaguest implication, that he did anything but disapprove it.", "And that's my view now.", "I disapprove of the issue.", "I do not suggest that Mr. Nixon does in any way.", " Well I welcome this opportunity to join Senator Kennedy completely on that statement and to say before this largest television audience in history something that I have been saying in the past and want to - will always say in the future.", "On our last television debate, I pointed out that it was my position that Americans must choose the best man that either party could produce.", "We can't settle for anything but the best.", "And that means, of course, the best man that this nation can produce.", "And that means that we can't have any test of religion.", "We can't have any test of race.", "It must be a test of a man.", "Also as far as religion is concerned.", "I have seen Communism abroad.", "I see what it does.", "Communism is the enemy of all religions; and we who do believe in God must join together.", "We must not be divided on this issue.", "The worst thing that I can think can happen in this campaign would be for it to be decided on religious issues.", "I obviously repudiate the Klan; I repudiate anybody who uses the religious issue; I will not tolerate it, I have ordered all of my people to have nothing to do with it and I say - say to this great audience, whoever may be listening, remember, if you believe in America, if you want America to set the right example to the world, that we cannot have religious or racial prejudice.", "We cannot have it in our hearts.", "But we certainly cannot have it in a presidential campaign.", " Mr. McGee, I am planning a speech on that subject next week.", "Uh - Also, so that we can get the uh - opportunity for the questioners to question me, it will be before the next television debate.", "Uh - I will say simply, in advance of it, that I believe that in this area, the laws which should be passed uh - as far as the big national emergency strikes are concerned, are ones that will give the president more weapons with which to deal with those strikes.", "Now, I have a basic disagreement with Senator Kennedy, though, on this point.", "He has taken the position, when he first indicated in October of last year, that he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons the president might have to stop a national emergency strike.", "I understand in his last speech before the Steelworkers Union, that he changed that position and indicated that he felt that government seizure might be the best way to stop a strike which could not be settled by collective bargaining.", "I do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure.", "I think the moment that you give to the union, on the one side, and to management, on the other side, the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled, that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government, and that will be a - be in the end, in my opinion, wage control; it would mean price control - all the things that we do not want.", "I do believe, however, that we can give to the president of the United States powers, in addition to what he presently has in the fact finding area, which would enable him to be more effective than we have been in handling these strikes.", "One last point I should make.", "The record in handling them has been very good during this Administration.", "We have had less man-hours lost by strikes in these last seven years than we had in the previous seven years, by a great deal.", "And I only want to say that however good the record is, it's got to be better.", "Because in this critical year - period of the sixties we've got to move forward, all Americans must move forward together, and we have to get the greatest cooperation possible between labor and management.", "We cannot afford stoppages of massive effect on the economy when we're in the terrible competition we're in with the Soviets.", " Well, I always have difficulty recognizing my positions when they're stated by the Vice President.", "I never suggested that compulsory arbitration was the solution for national emergency disputes.", "I'm opposed to that, was opposed to it in October, 1958.", "I have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act.", "I don't know what other weapons the Vice President is talking about.", "I'm talking about giving him four or five tools - not only the fact-finding committee that he now has under the injunction provision, not only the injunction, but also the power of the fact-finding commission to make recommendations - recommendations which would not be binding, but nevertheless would have great force of public opinion behind them.", "One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure.", "There might be others.", "By the president having five powers - four or five powers - and he only has very limited powers today, neither the company nor the union would be sure which power would be used; and therefore, there would be a greater incentive on both sides to reach an agreement themselves without taking it to the government.", "The difficulty now is the president's course is quite limited.", "He can set up a fact-finding committee.", "The fact-finding committee's powers are limited.", "He can provide an injunction if there's a national emergency for eighty days, then the strike can go on; and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the Congress.", "This is a difficult and sensitive matter.", "But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do.", "He could leave the parties in doubt as to which one he would use; and therefore there would be incentive, instead of as now - the steel companies were ready to take the strike because they felt the injunction of eighty days would break the union, which didn't happen.", " Yes, I have stated in both uh - debates and state again that I believe in a balanced budget and have supported that concept during my fourteen years in the Congress.", "The only two times when an unbalanced budget is warranted would be during a serious recession - and we had that in fifty-eight in an unbalanced budget of twelve billion dollars - or a national emergency where there should be large expenditures for national defense, which we had in World War II and uh - during part of the Korean War.", "On the question of the cost of our budget, I have stated that it's my best judgment that our agricultural program will cost a billion and a half, possibly two billion dollars less than the present agricultural program.", "My judgment is that the program the Vice President put forward, which is an extension of Mr. Benson's program, will cost a billion dollars more than the present program, which costs about six billion dollars a year, the most expensive in history.", "We've spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before that.", "Secondly, I believe that the high interest-rate policy that this Administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt - merely funding the debt - which is a burden an the taxpayers.", "I would hope, under a different monetary policy, that it would be possible to reduce that interest-rate burden, at least a billion dollars.", "Third, I think it's possible to gain a seven hundred million to a billion dollars through tax changes which I believe would close up loof- loopholes on dividend withholding, on expense accounts.", "Fourthly, I have suggested that the medical care for the aged - and the bill which the Congress now has passed and the President signed if fully implemented would cost a billion dollars on the Treasury - out of Treasury funds and a billion dollars by the states - the proposal that I have put forward and which many of the members of my party support is for medical care financed under Social Security; which would be financed under the Social Security taxes; which is less than three cents a day per person for medical care, doctors' bills, nurses, hospitals, when they retire.", "It is actuarially sound.", "So in my judgment we would spend more money in this Administration on aid to education, we'd spend more money on housing, we'd spend more money and I hope more wisely on defense than this Administration has.", "But I believe that the next Administration should work for a balanced budget, and that would be my intention.", "Mr. Nixon misstates my figures constantly, which uh - is of course his right, but the fact of the matter is: here is where I stand and I just want to have it on the public record.", " Senator Kennedy has indicated on several occasions in this program tonight that I have been misstating his record and his figures.", "I will issue a white paper after this broadcast, quoting exactly what he said on compulsory arbitration, for example, and the record will show that I have been correct.", "Now as far as his figures are concerned here tonight, he again is engaging in this, what I would call, mirror game of \"here-it-is-and-here-it-isn't.\"", "Uh - On the one hand, for example, he suggests that as far as his medical care program is concerned that that really isn't a problem because it's from Social Security.", "But Social Security is a tax.", "The people pay it.", "It comes right out of your paycheck.", "This doesn't mean that the people aren't going to be paying the bill.", "He also indicates as far as his agricultural program is concerned that he feels it will cost less than ours.", "Well, all that I can suggest is that all the experts who have studied the program indicate that it is the most fantastic program, the worst program, insofar as its effect on the farmers, that the - America has ever had foisted upon it in an election year or any other time.", "And I would also point out that Senator Kennedy left out a part of the cost of that program - a twenty-five percent rise in food prices that the people would have to pay.", "Now are we going to have that when it isn't going to help the farmers?", "I don't think we should have that kind of a program.", "Then he goes on to say that he's going to change the interest-rate situation and we're going to get some more money that way.", "Well, what he is saying there in effect, we're going to have inflation.", "We're going to go right back to what we had under Mr. Truman when he had political control of the Federal Reserve Board.", "I don't believe we ought to pay our bills through inflation, through a phony interest rate.", " Mr. Drummond, I am never satisfied with the economic growth of this country.", "I'm not satisfied with it even if there were no Communism in the world, but particularly when we're in the kind of a race we're in, we have got to see that America grows just as fast as we can, provided we grow soundly.", "Because even though we have maintained, as I pointed out in our first debate, the absolute gap over the Soviet Union; even though the growth in this Administration has been twice as much as it was in the Truman Administration; that isn't good enough.", "Because America must be able to grow enough not only to take care of our needs at home for better education and housing and health - all these things we want.", "We've got to grow enough to maintain the forces that we have abroad and to wage the non-military battle for the war - uh - for the world in Asia, in Africa and Latin America.", "It's going to cost more money, and growth will help us to win that battle.", "Now, what do we do about it?", "And here I believe basically that what we have to do is to stimulate that sector of America, the private enterprise sector of the economy, in which there is the greatest possibility for expansion.", "So that is why I advocate a program of tax reform which will stimulate more investment in our economy.", "In addition to that, we have to move on other areas that are holding back growth.", "I refer, for example, to distressed areas.", "We have to move into those areas with programs so that we make adequate use of the resources of those areas.", "We also have to see that all of the people of the United States - the tremendous talents that our people have - are used adequately.", "That's why in this whole area of civil rights, the equality of opportunity for employment and education is not just for the benefit of the minority groups, it's for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need.", "And in addition to that, we need programs, particularly in higher education, which will stimulate scientific breakthroughs which will bring more growth.", "Now what all this, of course, adds up to is this: America has not been standing still.", "Let's get that straight.", "Anybody who says America's been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling around America.", "He's been traveling in some other country.", "We have been moving.", "We have been moving much faster than we did in the Truman years.", "But we can and must move faster, and that's why I stand so strongly for programs that will move America forward in the sixties, move her forward so that we can stay ahead of the Soviet Union and win the battle for freedom and peace.", " Well first may I correct a statement which was made before, that under my agricultural program food prices would go up twenty-five percent.", "That's untrue.", "The fa- the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twenty-five-cent loaf of bread.", "Even if you put his income up ten percent, that would be two and three-quarters percent three pers- or three cents out of that twenty-five cents.", "The t- man who grows tomatoes - it costs less for those tomatoes than it does for the label on the can.", "And I believe when the average hour for many farmers' wage is about fifty cents an hour, he should do better.", "But anybody who suggests that that program would c- come to any figure indicated by the Vice President is in error.", "The Vice President suggested a number of things.", "He suggested that we aid distressed areas.", "The Administration has vetoed that bill passed by the Congress twice.", "He suggested we pass an aid to education bill.", "But the Administration and the Republican majority in the Congress has opposed any realistic aid to education.", "And the Vice President cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers' salaries in the Senate, which prevented that being added.", "This Administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth - which means jobs - of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959.", "And when we have to find twenty-five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years, we're going to have to grow more.", "Governor Rockefeller says five per cent.", "The Democratic platform and others say five per cent.", "Many say four and a half per cent.", "The last eight years the average growth has been about two and a half per cent.", "That's why we don't have full employment today.", " Uh - Mr. McGee, there are about a hundred and four commodities that have some kind of depletion allowance - different kind of minerals, including oil.", "I believe all of those should be gone over in detail to make sure that no one is getting a tax break; to make sure that no one is getting away from paying the taxes he ought to pay.", " it includes all kinds of minerals; it includes everything within the range of taxation.", "We want to be sure it's fair and equitable.", "It includes oil abroad.", "Perhaps that oil abroad should be treated differently than the oil here at home.", "Now the oil industry recently has had hard times.", "Particularly some of the smaller producers.", "They're moving about eight or nine days in Texas.", "But I can assure you that if I'm elected president, the whole spectrum of taxes will be gone through carefully.", "And if there is any inequities in oil or any other commodity, then I would vote to close that loophole, I have voted in the past to reduce the depletion allowance for the largest producers; for those from five million dollars down, to maintain it at twenty-seven and a half per cent.", "I believe we should study this and other allowances; tax expense, dividend expenses and all the rest, and make a determination of how we can stimulate growth; how we can provide the revenues needed to move our country forward.", " Senator Kennedy's position and mine completely different on this.", "I favor the present depletion allowance.", "I favor it not because I want to make a lot of oil men rich, but because I want to make America rich.", "Why do we have a depletion allowance?", "Because this is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to go out and explore for oil, to develop it.", "If we didn't have a depletion allowance of certainly, I believe, the present amount, we would have our oil exploration cut substantially in this country.", "Now, as far as my position then is concerned, it is exactly opposite to the Senator's.", "And it's because of my belief that if America is going to have the growth that he talks about and that I talk about and that we want, the thing to do is not to discourage individual enterprise, not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and minerals, but to encourage them.", "And so he would be doing exactly the wrong thing.", "One other thing.", "He suggests that there are a number of other items in this whole depletion field that could be taken into account.", "He also said a moment ago that we would get more money to finance his programs by revising the tax laws, including depletion.", "I should point out that as far as depletion allowances are concerned, the oil depletion allowance is one that provides eighty percent of all of those involved in depletion, so you're not going to get much from revenue insofar as depletion allowances are concerned, unless you move in the area that he indicated.", "But I oppose it.", "I oppose it for the reasons that I mentioned.", "I oppose it because I want us to have more oil exploration and not less.", " Well, Mr.", "Von Fremd, the first thing we have to do is to continue to keep confidence abroad in the American dollar.", "That means that we must continue to have a balanced budget here at home in every possible circumstance that we can; because the moment that we have loss of confidence in our own fiscal policies at home, it results in gold flowing out.", "Secondly, we have to increase our exports, as compared with our imports.", "And here we have a very strong program going forward in the Department of Commerce.", "This one must be stepped up.", "Beyond that, as far as the gold supply is concerned, and as far as the movement of gold is concerned, uh - we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom.", "Now America has been carrying a tremendous load in this respect.", "I think we have been right in carrying it.", "I have favored our programs abroad for economic assistance and for military assistance.", "But now we find that the countries of Europe for example, that we have aided, and Japan, that we've aided in the Far East; these countries - some our former enemies, have now recovered completely.", "They have got to bear a greater share of this load of economic assistance abroad.", "That's why I am advocating, and will develop during the course of the next Administration - if, of course, I get the opportunity - a program in which we enlist more aid from these other countries on a concerted basis in the programs of economic development for Africa, Asia and Latin America.", "The United States cannot continue to carry the major share of this burden by itself.", "We can a big share of it, but we've got to have more help from our friends abroad; and these three factors, I think, will be very helpful in reversing the gold flow which you spoke about.", " Just to uh - correct the record, Mr. Nixon said on depletion that his record was the opposite of mine.", "What I said was that this matter should be thoroughly gone into to make sure that there aren't loopholes.", "If his record is the opposite of that, that means that he doesn't want to go into it.", "Now on the question of gold.", "The difficulty, of course, is that we do have heavy obligations abroad, that we therefore have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of our dollars overseas to pay our troops, maintain our bases, and sustain other economies.", "In other words, if we're going to continue to maintain our position in the sixties, we have to maintain a sound monetary and fiscal policy.", "We have to have control over inflation, and we also have to have a favorable balance of trade.", "We have to be able to compete in the world market.", "We have to be able to sell abroad more than we consume uh - from abroad if we're going to be able to meet our obligations.", "In addition, many of the countries around the world still keep restrictions against our goads, going all the way back to the days when there was a dollar shortage.", "Now there isn't a dollar shortage, and yet many of these countries continue to move against our goods.", "I believe that we must be able to compete in the market - steel and in all the basic commodities abroad - we must be able to compete against them because we always did because of our technological lead.", "We have to be sure to maintain that.", "We have to persuade these other countries not to restrict our goods coming in, not to act as if there was a dollar gap; and third, we have to persuade them to assume some of the responsibilities that up till now we've maintained, to assist underdeveloped countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia make an economic breakthrough on their own.", " Well, I think there are many uh - tests, Mr. Drummond, of prestige.", "And the significance of prestige, really, is because we're so identified with the cause of freedom.", "Therefore, if we are on the mount, if we are rising, if our influence is spreading, if our prestige is spreading, then those uh - who stand now on the razor edge of decision between us or between the Communist system, wondering whether they should use the system of freedom to develop their countries or the system of Communism, they'll be persuaded to follow our example.", "There have been several indications that our prestige is not as high as it once was.", "Mr. George Allen, the head of our information service, said that a result of our being second in space, in the sputnik in 1957, and I quote him, I believe I paraphrase him accurately.", "He said that many of these countries equate space developments with scientific productivity and scientific advancement.", "And therefore, he said, many of these countries now feel that the Soviet Union, which was once so backward, is now on a par with the United States.", "Secondly, the economic growth of the Soviet Union is greater than ours.", "Mr. Dulles has suggested it's from two to three times as great as ours.", "This has a great effect on the s- underdeveloped world, which faces problems of low income and high population density and inadequate resources.", "Three, a Gallup Poll taken in February asked people in ten countries which country they thought would be first in 1970, both scientifically and militarily.", "And a majority in every country except Greece, felt that it would be the Soviet Union by l970.", "Four, in the votes at the U.N., particularly the vote dealing with Red China last Saturday, we received the support on the position that we had taken of only two African countries - one, Liberia, which had been tied to us for more than a century, and the other, Union of South Africa, which is not a popular country in Africa.", "Every other ca- African country either abstained or voted against us.", "A - More countries voted against us in Asia on this issue than voted with us.", "On the neutralists' resolution, which we were so much opposed to, the same thing happened.", "The candidate who was a candidate for the president of Brazil, took a trip to Cuba to call on Mr. Castro during the election in order to get the benefit of the Castro supporters uh - within Brazil.", "There are many indications.", "Guinea and Ghana, two independent countries within the last three years - Guinea in fifty-seven, Ghana within the last eighteen months - both now are supporting the Soviet foreign policy at the U.N. Mr. Herter said so himself.", "Laos is moving in that direction.", "So I would say our prestige is not so high.", "No longer do we give the image of being on the rise.", "No longer do we give an image of vitality.", " Well, I would say first of all that Senator's - Kennedy's statement that he's just made is not going to help our Gallup Polls abroad and it isn't going to help our prestige either.", "Let's look at the other side of the coin.", "Let's look at the vote on the Congo, the vote was seventy to nothing against the Soviet Union.", "Let's look at the situation with regard to economic growth as it really is.", "We find that the Soviet Union is a very primitive economy.", "Its growth rate is not what counts; it's whether it is catching up with us and it is not catching up with us.", "We're well ahead and we can stay ahead, provided we have confidence in America and don't run her down in order to build her up.", "We could look also at other items which Senator Kennedy has named, but I will only conclude by saying this: in this whole matter of prestige, in the final analysis, its whether you stand for what's right.", "And getting back to this matter that we discussed at the outset, the matter of Quemoy and Matsu.", "I can think of nothing that will be a greater blow to the prestige of the United States among the free nations in Asia than for us to take Senator Kennedy's advan- advice to go - go against what a majority of the members of the Senate, both Democrat and Republican, did - said in 1955, and to say in advance we will surrender an area to the Communists.", "In other words, if the United States is going to maintain its strength and its prestige, we must not only be strong militarily and economically, we must be firm diplomatically.", "Thi- Certainly we have been speaking, I know, of whether we should have retreat or defeat.", "Let's remember the way to win is not to retreat and not to surrender.", " Yes, I certainly do.", "(LAUGHTER)  But let me just first, Cheryl, if you will, I want to thank Charlie for moderating.", "I want to thank Washington University for hosting us here this evening.", "Mr. President, it's good to be with you again this evening, sir.", "Cheryl, the president didn't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, so he's really turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception.", "And the result is that you've been bombarded with advertisements suggesting that I've changed a position on this or that or the other.", "Now, the three things they try to say I've changed position on are the Patriot Act; I haven't.", "I support it.", "I just don't like the way John Ashcroft has applied it, and we're going to change a few things.", "The chairman of the Republican Party thinks we ought to change a few things.", "No Child Left Behind Act, I voted for it.", "I support it.", "I support the goals.", "But the president has underfunded it by $28 billion.", "Right here in St. Louis, you've laid off 350 teachers.", "You're 150 -- excuse me, I think it's a little more, about $100 million shy of what you ought to be under the No Child Left Behind Act to help your education system here.", "So I complain about that.", "I've argued that we should fully funded it.", "The president says I've changed my mind.", "I haven't changed my mind: I'm going to fully fund it.", "So these are the differences.", "Now, the president has presided over an economy where we've lost 1.6 million jobs.", "The first president in 72 years to lose jobs.", "I have a plan to put people back to work.", "That's not wishy- washy.", "I'm going to close the loopholes that actually encourage companies to go overseas.", "The president wants to keep them open.", "I think I'm right.", "I think he's wrong.", "I'm going to give you a tax cut.", "The president gave the top 1 percent of income-earners in America, got $89 billion last year, more than the 80 percent of people who earn $100,000 or less all put together.", "I think that's wrong.", "That's not wishy-washy, and that's what I'm fighting for, you.", " Charlie, thank you, and thank our panelists.", "And, Senator, thank you.", "I can -- and thanks, Washington U. as well.", "I can see why people at your workplace think he changes positions a lot, because he does.", "He said he voted for the $87 billion, and voted against it right before he voted for it.", "And that sends a confusing signal to people.", "He said he thought Saddam Hussein was a grave threat, and now he said it was a mistake to remove Saddam Hussein from power.", "No, I can see why people think that he changes position quite often, because he does.", "You know, for a while he was a strong supporter of getting rid of Saddam Hussein.", "He saw the wisdom -- until the Democrat primary came along and Howard Dean, the anti-war candidate, began to gain on him, and he changed positions.", "I don't see how you can lead this country in a time of war, in a time of uncertainty, if you change your mind because of politics.", "He just brought up the tax cut.", "You remember we increased that child credit by $1,000, reduced the marriage penalty, created a 10 percent tax bracket for the lower-income Americans.", "That's right at the middle class.", "He voted against it.", "And yet he tells you he's for a middle- class tax cut.", "It's -- you've got to be consistent when you're

force.", "The hardest decision a president makes is ever to use force.", "After 9/11, we had to look at the world differently.", "After 9/11, we had to recognize that when we saw a threat, we must take it seriously before it comes to hurt us.", "In the old days we'd see a threat, and we could deal with it if we felt like it or not.", "But 9/11 changed it all.", "I vowed to our countrymen that I would do everything I could to protect the American people.", "That's why we're bringing Al Qaida to justice.", "Seventy five percent of them have been brought to justice.", "That's why I said to Afghanistan: If you harbor a terrorist, you're just as guilty as the terrorist.", "And the Taliban is no longer in power, and Al Qaida no longer has a place to plan.", "And I saw a unique threat in Saddam Hussein, as did my opponent, because we thought he had weapons of mass destruction.", "And the unique threat was that he could give weapons of mass destruction to an organization like Al Qaida, and the harm they inflicted on us with airplanes would be multiplied greatly by weapons of mass destruction.", "And that was the serious, serious threat.", "So I tried diplomacy, went to the United Nations.", "But as we learned in the same report I quoted, Saddam Hussein was gaming the oil-for-food program to get rid of sanctions.", "He was trying to get rid of sanctions for a reason: He wanted to restart his weapons programs.", "We all thought there was weapons there, Robin.", "My opponent thought there was weapons there.", "That's why he called him a grave threat.", "I wasn't happy when we found out there wasn't weapons, and we've got an intelligence group together to figure out why.", "But Saddam Hussein was a unique threat.", "And the world is better off without him in power.", "And my opponent's plans lead me to conclude that Saddam Hussein would still be in power, and the world would be more dangerous.", "Thank you, sir.", " Robin, I'm going to answer your question.", "I'm also going to talk -- respond to what you asked, Cheryl, at the same time.", "The world is more dangerous today.", "The world is more dangerous today because the president didn't make the right judgments.", "Now, the president wishes that I had changed my mind.", "He wants you to believe that because he can't come here and tell you that he's created new jobs for America.", "He's lost jobs.",

can't come here and tell you that he's left no child behind because he didn't fund no child left behind.", "So what does he do?", "He's trying to attack me.", "He wants you to believe that I can't be president.", "And he's trying to make you believe it because he wants you to think I change my mind.", "Well, let me tell you straight up: I've never changed my mind about Iraq.", "I do believe Saddam Hussein was a threat.", "I always believed he was a threat.", "Believed it in 1998 when Clinton was president.", "I wanted to give Clinton the power to use force if necessary.", "But I would have used that force wisely, I would have used that authority wisely, not rushed to war without a plan to win the peace.", "I would have brought our allies to our side.", "I would have fought to make certain

fact that Iraqis love to be free.", "He said he was optimistic when he came here, then he turned on the TV and listened to the political rhetoric and all of a sudden he was pessimistic.", "Now, this

was Osama bin Laden and Afghanistan.", "That was the right place.", "And the right time was Tora Bora, when we had him cornered in the mountains.", "Now, everyone in the world knows that there were no

principle.", "Somebody called that stubborn.", "He stood on principle standing up to the Soviet Union, and we won that conflict.", "Yet at the same time, he was very -- we were very unpopular in

Hague, which is where our troops could be brought to -- brought in front of a judge, an unaccounted judge.", "I don't think we ought to join that.", "That was unpopular.", "And so, what I'm telling you is, is that sometimes in this world you make unpopular decisions because you think they're right.", "We'll continue to reach out.", "Listen, there is 30 nations involved in Iraq, some 40 nations

thing.", "You don't want to join the International Criminal Court just because it's popular in certain capitals in Europe.", " Nikki, that's a question that's been raised by a lot of people around the country.", "Let me address it but also talk about the weapons the president just talked about, because every part of the president's answer just now promises you more of the same over the next four

meet with the members of the Security Council in the week before we voted.", "I went to New York.", "I talked to all of them to find out how serious they were about really holding Saddam Hussein accountable.", "I came away convinced that, if we worked at it, if we were ready to work and letting Hans Blix do his job and thoroughly go through the inspections, that if push came to shove, they'd be there with us.", "But the president just arbitrarily brought the hammer down and said, \"Nope.", "Sorry, time for diplomacy is over.", "We're going.\"", "He rushed to war without a plan to win the peace.", "Ladies and gentleman, he gave you a speech and told you he'd plan carefully, take every precaution, take our allies with us.", "He didn't.", "He broke his word.", " I remember sitting in the White House looking at those generals, saying, \"Do you have what you need in this war?", "Do you have what it takes?\"", "I remember going down to the basement of the White House the day we committed our troops as last resort, looking at Tommy Franks and the generals on the ground, asking them, \"Do we have the right plan with the right troop level?\"", "And they looked me in the eye and said, \"Yes, sir, Mr.", "President.\"", "Of course, I listen to our generals.", "That's what a president does.", "A president sets the strategy and relies upon good military people to execute that strategy.", " You rely on good military people to execute the military component of the strategy, but winning the peace is larger than just the military component.", "General Shinseki had the wisdom

was necessary.", "Didn't bring in enough nation.", "Didn't deliver the help.", "Didn't close off the borders.", "Didn't even guard the ammo dumps.", "And now our kids are being killed with ammos right out of that dump.", " Is it Randee?", " I don't think you can just rely on U.N. sanctions, Randee.", "But you're absolutely correct, it is a threat, it's a huge threat.", "And what's interesting is, it's a threat that has grown while the president has been preoccupied with Iraq, where there wasn't a threat.", "If he'd let the inspectors do their job and go on, we wouldn't have 10 times the numbers of forces in Iraq that we have in Afghanistan chasing Osama bin Laden.", "Meanwhile, while Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons, some 37 tons of what they called yellow cake, the stuff they use to make enriched uranium, while they're doing that, North Korea has moved from one bomb maybe, maybe, to four to seven bombs.", "For two years, the president didn't even engage with North Korea, did nothing at all, while it was growing more dangerous, despite the warnings of former Secretary of Defense William Perry, who negotiated getting television cameras and inspectors into that reactor.", "We were safer before President Bush came to office.", "Now they have the bombs and we're less safe.", "So what do we do?", "We've got to join with the British and the French, with the Germans, who've been involved, in their initiative.", "We've got to lead the world now to crack down on proliferation as a whole.", "But the president's been slow to do that, even in Russia.", "At his pace, it's going to take 13 years to reduce and get ahold of all the loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union.", "I've proposed a plan that can capture it and contain it and clean it within four years.", "And the president is moving to the creation of our own bunker- busting nuclear weapon.", "It's very hard to get other countries to give up their weapons when you're busy developing a new one.", "I'm going to lead the world in the greatest counterproliferation effort.", "And if we have to get tough with Iran, believe me, we will get tough.", " That answer almost made me want to scowl.", "He keeps talking about, \"Let the inspectors do their job.\"", "It's naive and dangerous to say that.", "That's what the Duelfer report showed.", "He was deceiving the inspectors.", "Secondly, of course we've been involved with Iran.", "I fully understand the threat.", "And that's why we're doing what he suggested we do: Get the Brits, the Germans and the French to go make it very clear to the Iranians that if they expect to be a party to the world to give up their nuclear ambitions.", "We've been doing that.", "Let me talk about North Korea.", "It is naive and dangerous to take a policy that he suggested the other day, which is to have bilateral relations with North Korea.", "Remember, he's the person who's accusing me of not acting multilaterally.", "He now wants to take the six-party talks we have -- China, North Korea, South Korea, Russia, Japan and the United States -- and undermine them by having bilateral talks.", "That's what President Clinton did.", "He had bilateral talks with the North Koreans.", "And guess what happened?", "He didn't honor the agreement.", "He was enriching uranium.", "That is a bad policy.", "Of course, we're paying attention to these.", "It's a great question about Iran.", "That's why in my speech to the Congress I said: There's an \"Axis of Evil,\" Iraq, Iran and North Korea, and we're paying attention to it.", "And we're making progress.", " Yes, that's a great question.", "Thanks.", "I hear there's rumors on the Internets (sic) that we're going to have a draft.", "We're not going to have a draft, period.", "The all- volunteer army works.", "It works particularly when we pay our troops well.", "It works when we make sure they've got housing, like we have done in the last military budgets.", "An all-volunteer army is best suited to fight the new wars of the 21st century, which is to be specialized and to find these people as they hide around the world.", "We don't need mass armies anymore.", "One of the things we've done is we've taken the -- we're beginning to transform our military.", "And by that I mean we're moving troops out of Korea and replacing them with more effective weapons.", "We don't need as much manpower on the Korean Peninsula to keep a deterrent.", "In Europe, we have massed troops as if the Soviet Union existed and was going to invade into Europe, but those days are over with.", "And so we're moving troops out of Europe and replacing it with more effective equipment.", "So to answer your question is, we're withdrawing, not from the world, we're withdrawing manpower so they can be stationed here in America, so there's less rotation, so life is easier on their families and therefore more likely to be -- we'll be more likely to be able to keep people in the all-volunteer army.", "One of the more important things we're doing in this administration is transformation.", "There are some really interesting technologies.", "For instance, we're flying unmanned vehicles that can send real- time messages back to stations in the United States.", "That saves manpower, and it saves equipment.", "It also means that we can target things easier and move more quickly, which means we need to be lighter and quicker and more facile and highly trained.", "Now, forget all this talk about a draft.", "We're not going to have a draft so long as I am the president.", " Daniel, I don't support a draft.", "But let me tell you where the president's policies have put us.", "The president -- and this is one of the reasons why I am very proud in this race to have the support of General John Shalikashvili, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Admiral William Crowe, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; General Tony McPeak, who ran the air war for the president's father and did a brilliant job, supporting me; General Wes Clark, who won the war in Kosovo, supporting me; because they all -- and General Baca, who was the head of the National Guard, supporting me.", "Why?", "Because they understand that our military is overextended under the president.", "Our Guard and reserves have been turned into almost active duty.", "You've got people doing two and three rotations.", "You've got stop-loss policies, so people can't get out when they were supposed to.", "You've got a back-door draft right now.", "And a lot of our military are underpaid.", "These are families that get hurt.", "It hurts the middle class.", "It hurts communities, because these are our first responders.", "And they're called up.", "And they're over there, not over here.", "Now, I'm going to add 40,000 active duty forces to the military, and I'm going to make people feel good about being safe in our military, and not overextended, because I'm going to run a foreign policy that actually does what President Reagan did, President Eisenhower did, and others.", "We're going to build alliances.", "We're not going to go unilaterally.", "We're not going to go alone like this president did.", " Let me just -- I've got to answer this.", " Let me answer what he just said, about around the world.", " You tell Tony Blair we're going alone.", "Tell Tony Blair we're going alone.", "Tell Silvio Berlusconi we're going alone.", "Tell Aleksander Kwasniewski of Poland we're going alone.", "There are 30 countries there.", "It denigrates an alliance to say we're going alone,

the coalition, not joining.", "Eight countries have left it.", "If Missouri, just given the number of people from Missouri who are in the military over there today, were a country, it would be the third largest country in the coalition, behind Great Britain and the United States.", "That's not a grand coalition.", "Ninety percent of the casualties are American.", "Ninety percent of the costs

security briefings why that is, and I can't go into all the answers, et cetera, but let me say this to you.", "This president and his administration have told you and all of us it's not a question of when, it's a question of -- excuse me -- not a question of if, it's a question of when.", "We've been told that.", "The when I can't tell you.", "Between the World Trade Center bombing in, what was it, 1993 or so, and the next time was five years, seven years.", "These people wait.", "They'll plan.", "They plot.", "I agree with the president that we have to go after them and get them wherever they are.", "I just think I can do that far more effectively, because the most important weapon in doing that is intelligence.", "You've got to have the best intelligence in the world.", "And in order to have the best intelligence in the world to know who the terrorists are and where they are and what they're plotting, you've got to have the best cooperation you've ever had in the world.", "Now, to go back to your question, Nikki, we're not getting the best cooperation in the world today.", "We've got a whole bunch of countries that pay a price for dealing with the United States of America now.", "I'm going to change that.", "And I'm going to put in place a better homeland security effort.", "Look, 95 percent of our containers coming into this country are not inspected today.", "When you get on an airplane, your bag is X- rayed, but the cargo hold isn't X-rayed.", "Do you feel safer?", "This president in the last debate said, \"Well, that would be a big tax gap if we did that.\"",

aren't being secured, chemical plants, nuclear plants that aren't secured, hospitals that are overcrowded with their emergency rooms.", "If we had a disaster today, could they handle it?", "This president chose a tax cut over homeland security.", "Wrong choice.", " That's an odd thing to say, since we've tripled the homeland security budget from $10 billion to $30 billion.", "Listen, we'll do everything we can to protect the homeland.", "My opponent's right, we need good intelligence.", "It's also a curious thing for him to say since right after 1993 he voted to cut the intelligence budget by $7.5 billion.", "The best way to defend America in this world we live in is to stay on the offense.", "We got to be right 100 percent of the time here at home, and they got to be right once.", "And

you can lead troops if you say it's the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time.", "I don't see how the Iraqis are going to have confidence in the American president if all they hear is that it was a mistake to be there in the first place.", "This war is a long, long war, and it requires steadfast determination and it requires a complete understanding that we not only chase down Al Qaida but we disrupt terrorist safe havens as well as people who could provide the terrorists with support.", " Well, the president and his experts have told America that it's not a question of if; it's a question of when.", "And I accept what the president has said.", "These terrorists are serious, they're deadly, and they know nothing except trying to kill.", "I understand that.", "That's why I will never stop at anything to hunt down and kill the terrorists.", "But you heard the president just say to you that we've added money.", "Folks, the test is not if you've added money; the test is that you've done everything possible to make America secure.", "He chose a tax cut for wealthy Americans over the things that I listed to you.", " Well, we'll talk about the tax cut for middle class here in a minute.", "But yes, I'm worried.", "I'm worried.", "I'm worried about our country.", "And all I can tell you is every day I know that there's people working overtime, doing the very best they can.", "And the reason I'm worried is because there's a vicious enemy that has an ideology of hate.", "And the way to defeat them long-term, by the way, is to spread freedom.", "Liberty can change

you're reading a good judicial decision.", "What I want to find, if I am privileged to have the opportunity to do it -- and the Supreme Court of the United States is at stake in this race, ladies and

Protestant, whatever.", "I can't do that.", "But I can counsel people.", "I can talk reasonably about life and about responsibility.", "I can talk to people, as my wife Teresa does, about making other choices, and about abstinence, and about all these other things that we ought to do as a responsible society.", "But as a president, I have to represent all the people in the nation.", "And I have to make that judgment.", "Now, I believe that you can take that position and not be pro- abortion, but you have to afford people their constitutional rights.", "And that means being smart about allowing people to be fully educated, to know what their options are in life, and making certain that you don't deny a poor person the right to be able to have whatever the constitution affords them if they can't afford it otherwise.", "That's why I think it's important.", "That's why I think it's important for the United States, for instance, not to have this rigid ideological restriction on helping

taxpayers' money on abortion.", "This is an issue that divides America, but certainly reasonable people can agree on how to reduce abortions in America.", "I signed the partial-birth -- the ban on partial-birth abortion.", "It's a brutal practice.", "It's one way to help reduce abortions.", "My opponent voted against the ban.", "I think there ought to be parental notification laws.", "He's against them.", "I signed a bill called the Unborn Victims of Violence Act.", "In other words, if you're a mom and you're pregnant and you get killed, the murderer gets tried for two cases, not just one.", "My opponent was against that.", "These are reasonable ways to help promote a culture of life in America.", "I think it is a worthy goal in America to have every child protected by law and welcomed in life.", "I also think we ought to continue to have good adoption law as an alternative to abortion.", "And we need to promote maternity group homes, which my administration has done.",

my opponent is against that.", "You know, it's just not that simple.", "No, I'm not.", "I'm against the partial-birth abortion, but you've got to have an exception for the life of the mother and the health of the mother under the strictest test of bodily injury to the mother.", "Secondly, with respect to parental notification, I'm not going to require a 16-or 17-year-old kid who's been raped by her father and who's pregnant to have to notify her father.", "So you got to have a judicial intervention.", "And because they didn't have a judicial intervention where she could go somewhere and get help, I voted against it.", "It's never quite as simple as the president wants you to believe.", " Well, it's pretty simple when they say: Are you for a ban on partial birth abortion?", "Yes or no?",

responsibility for them.", "I'm human.", "But on the big questions, about whether or not we should have gone into Afghanistan, the big question about whether we should have removed somebody in Iraq, I'll stand by those decisions, because I think they're right.", "That's really what you're -- when they ask about the mistakes, that's what they're talking about.", "They're trying to say, \"Did you make a mistake going into Iraq?\"", "And the answer is, \"Absolutely not.\"", "It was the right decision.", "The Duelfer report confirmed that decision today, because what Saddam Hussein was doing was trying to get rid of sanctions so he could reconstitute a weapons program.", "And the biggest threat facing America is terrorists with weapons of mass destruction.", "We knew he hated us.", "We knew he'd been -- invaded other countries.", "We knew he tortured his own people.", "On the tax cut, it's a big decision.", "I did the right decision.", "Our recession was one of the shallowest in modern history.", "Now, you asked what mistakes.", "I made some mistakes in appointing people, but I'm not going to name them.", "I don't want to hurt their feelings on national TV.", "(LAUGHTER)", " But history will look back, and I'm fully prepared to accept any mistakes that history judges to my administration, because the president makes the decisions, the president has to take the responsibility.", " I believe the president made a huge mistake, a catastrophic mistake, not to live up to his own standard, which was: build a true global coalition, give the inspectors time to finish their job and go through the U.N. process to its end and go to war as a last resort.", "I ask each of you just to look into your hearts, look into your guts.", "Gut-check time.", "Was this really going to war as a last resort?", "The president rushed our nation to war without a plan to win the peace.", "And simple things weren't done.", "That's why Senator Lugar says: incompetent in the delivery of services.", "That's why Senator Hagel, Republican, says, you know: beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing, in the zone of dangerous.", "We didn't guard 850,000 tons of ammo.", "That ammo is now being used against our kids.", "Ten thousand out of 12,000 Humvees aren't armored.", "I visited some of those kids with no limbs today, because they didn't have the armor on those vehicles.", "They didn't have the right body armor.", "I've met parents who've on the Internet gotten the armor to send their kids.", "There is no bigger judgment for a president of the United states than how you take a nation to war.", "And you can't say, because Saddam might have done it 10 years from now, that's a reason; that's an excuse.", " He complains about the fact our troops don't have adequate equipment, yet he voted against the $87 billion supplemental I sent to the Congress and then issued one of the most amazing quotes in political history: \"I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it.\"", "Saddam Hussein was a risk to our country, ma'am.", "And he was a risk that -- and this is where we just have a difference of opinion.", "The truth of that matter is, if you listen carefully, Saddam would still be in power if he were the president of the United States, \"And the world would be a lot better off.\"", " Not necessarily be in power, but here's what I'll say about the $87 billion.", "I made a mistake in the way I talk about it.", "He made a mistake in invading Iraq.", "Which is a worse decision?", "Now, I voted the way I voted because I saw that he

convictions.", "I respect him for that.", "But we have a very different view about how to make America stronger and safer.", "I will never cede the authority of our country or our security to any other nation.", "I'll never give a veto over American security to any other entity -- not a nation, not a country, not an institution.", "But I know, as I think you do, that our country is strongest when we lead the world, when we lead strong alliances.", "And that's the way Eisenhower and Reagan and Kennedy and others did it.", "We are not doing that today.", "We need to.", "I have a plan that will help us go out and kill and find the terrorists.", "And I will not stop in our efforts to hunt down and kill the terrorists.", "But I'll also have a better plan of how we're going to deal with Iraq: training the Iraqi forces more rapidly, getting our allies back to the table with a fresh start, with new credibility, with a president whose judgment the rest of the world trusts.", "In addition to that, I believe we have a crisis here at home, a crisis of the middle class that is increasingly squeezed, health-care costs going up.", "I have a plan to provide health care to all Americans.", "I have a plan to provide for our schools so we keep the standards but we help our teachers teach and elevate our schools by funding No Child Left Behind.", "I have a plan to protect the environment so that we leave this place in better shape to our children than we were handed it by our parents.", "That's the test.", "I believe America's best days are ahead of us.", "I'm an optimist,

chance to discuss with you what to do to keep this economy going: keep the taxes low, don't increase the scope of the federal government, keep regulations down, legal reform, a health- care policy that does not empower the federal government but empowers individuals, and an energy plan that will help us become less dependent on foreign sources of energy.", "And abroad, we're at war.", "And it requires a president who is steadfast and strong and determined.", "I vowed to the American people after that fateful day of September the 11th that we would not rest nor tire until we're safe.", "The
