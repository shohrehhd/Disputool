[" Gwen, I want to thank you, and I want to thank the folks here at Case Western Reserve for hosting this tonight.", "It's a very important event, and they've done a superb job of putting it together.", "It's important to look at all of our developments in Iraq within the broader context of the global war on terror.", "And, after 9/11, it became clear that we had to do several things to have a successful strategy to win the global war on terror, specifically that we had to go after the terrorists wherever we might find them, that we also had to go after state sponsors of terror, those who might provide sanctuary or safe harbor for terror.", "And we also then finally had to stand up democracies in their stead afterwards, because that was the only way to guarantee that these states would not again become safe harbors for terror or for the development of deadly weapons.", "Concern about Iraq specifically focused on the fact that Saddam Hussein had been, for years, listed on the state sponsor of terror, that they he had established relationships with Abu Nidal, who operated out of Baghdad; he paid $25,000 to the families of suicide bombers; and he had an established relationship with Al Qaida.", "Specifically, look at George Tenet, the CIA director's testimony before the Committee on Foreign Relations two years ago when he talked about a 10-year relationship.", "The effort that we've mounted with respect to Iraq focused specifically on the possibility that this was the most likely nexus between the terrorists and weapons of mass destruction.", "The biggest threat we faced today is the possibility of terrorists smuggling a nuclear weapon or a biological agent into one of our own cities and threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans.", "What we did in Iraq was exactly the right thing to do.", "If I had it to recommend all over again, I would recommend exactly the same course of action.", "The world is far safer today because Saddam Hussein is in jail, his government is no longer in power.", "And we did exactly the right thing.", " Thank you.", "Thank you, Gwen, for moderating this debate.", "Thank you to the folks of Case Western and all the people in Ohio for having us here.", "Mr. Vice President, you are still not being straight with the American people.", "I mean, the reality you and George Bush continue to tell people, first, that things are going well in Iraq -- the American people don't need us to explain this to them, they see it on their television every single day.", "We lost more troops in September than we lost in August; lost more in August than we lost in July; lost more in July than we lost in June.", "The truth is, our men and women in uniform have been heroic.", "Our military has done everything they've been asked to do.", "And it's not just me that sees the mess in Iraq.", "There are Republican leaders, like John McCain, like Richard Lugar, like Chuck Hagel, who have said Iraq is a mess and it's getting worse.", "And when they were asked why, Richard Lugar said because of the incompetence of the administration.", "What Paul Bremer said yesterday is they didn't have enough troops to secure the country.", "They also didn't have a plan to win the peace.", "They also didn't put the alliances together to make this successful.", "We need a fresh start.", "We need a president who will speed up the training of the Iraqis, get more staff in for doing that.", "We need to speed up the reconstruction so the Iraqis see some tangible benefit.", "We need a new president who has the credibility, which John Kerry has, to bring others into this effort.", " We've made significant progress in Iraq.", "We've stood up a new government that's been in power now only 90 days.", "The notion of additional troops is talked about frequently, but the point of success in Iraq will be reached when we have turned governance over to the Iraqi people; they have been able to establish a democratic government.", "They're well on their way to doing that.", "They will have free elections next January for the first time in history.", "We also are actively, rapidly training Iraqis to take on the security responsibility.", "Those two steps are crucial to success in Iraq.", "They're well in hand, well under way.", "And I'm confident that, in fact, we'll get the job done.", " Yes.", "Mr. Vice President, there is no connection between the attacks of September 11th and Saddam Hussein.", "The 9/11 Commission has said it.", "Your own secretary of state has said it.", "And you've gone around the country suggesting that there is some connection.", "There is not.", "And in fact the CIA is now about to report that the connection between Al Qaida and Saddam Hussein is tenuous at best.", "And, in fact, the secretary of defense said yesterday that he knows of no hard evidence of the connection.", "We need to be straight with the American people.", " Here's what it means: It means that Saddam Hussein needed to be confronted.", "John Kerry and I have consistently said that.", "That's why we voted for the resolution.", "But it also means it needed to be done the right way.", "And doing it the right way meant that we were prepared; that we gave the weapons inspectors time to find out what we now know, that in fact there were no weapons of mass destruction; that we didn't take our eye off the ball, which are Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, the people who attacked us on September the 11th.", "Now, remember, we went into Afghanistan, which, by the way, was the right thing to do.", "That was the right decision.", "And our military performed terrifically there.", "But we had Osama bin Laden cornered at Tora Bora.", "We had the 10th Mountain Division up in Uzbekistan available.", "We had the finest military in the world on the ground.", "And what did we do?", "We turned -- this is the man who masterminded the greatest mass murder and terrorist attack in American history.", "And what did the administration decide to do?", "They gave the responsibility of capturing and/or killing Saddam -- I mean Osama bin Laden to Afghan warlords who, just a few weeks before, had been working with Osama bin Laden.", "Our point in this is not complicated: We were attacked by Al Qaida and Osama bin Laden.", "We went into Afghanistan and very quickly the administration made a decision to divert attention from that and instead began to plan for the invasion of Iraq.", "And these connections -- I want the American people to hear this very clearly.", "Listen carefully to what the vice president is saying.", "Because there is no connection between Saddam Hussein and the attacks of September 11th -- period.", "The 9/11 Commission has said that's true.", "Colin Powell has said it's true.", "But the vice president keeps suggesting that there is.", "There is not.", "And, in fact, any connection with Al Qaida is tenuous at best.", " The senator has got his facts wrong.", "I have not suggested there's a connection between Iraq and 9/11, but there's clearly an established Iraqi track record with terror.", "And the point is that that's the place where you're most likely to see the terrorists come together with weapons of mass destruction, the deadly technologies that Saddam Hussein had developed and used over the years.", "Now, the fact of the matter is, the big difference here, Gwen, is they are not prepared to deal with states that sponsor terror.", "They've got a very limited view about how to use U.S. military forces to defend America.", "We heard Senator Kerry say the other night that there ought to be some kind of global test before U.S. troops are deployed preemptively to protect the United States.", "That's part of a track record that goes back to the 1970s when he ran for Congress the first time and said troops should not be deployed without U.N. approval.", "Then, in the mid-'80s, he ran on the basis of cutting most of our major defense programs.", "In 1991, he voted against Desert Storm.", "It's a consistent pattern over time of always being on the wrong side of defense issues.", "A little tough talk in the midst of a campaign or as part of a presidential debate cannot obscure a record of 30 years of being on the wrong side of defense issues.", "And they give absolutely no indication, based on that record, of being wiling to go forward and aggressively pursue the war on terror with a kind of strategy that will work, that will defeat our enemies and will guarantee that the United States doesn't again get attacked by the likes of Al Qaida.", " Gwen, we've never let up on Osama bin Laden from day one.", "We've actively and aggressively pursued him.", "We've captured or killed thousands of Al Qaida in various places around the world and especially in Afghanistan.", "We'll continue to very aggressively pursue him, and I'm confident eventually we'll get him.", "The key to success in Afghanistan has been, again, to go in and go after the terrorists, which we've done, and also take down the Taliban regime which allowed them to function there, in effect sponsors, if you will, of the Al Qaida organization.", "John Edwards, two and a half years ago, six months after we went into Afghanistan announced that it was chaotic, the situation was deteriorating, the warlords were about to take over.", "Here we are, two and a half years later, we're four days away from a democratic election, the first one in history in Afghanistan.", "We've got 10 million voters who have registered to vote, nearly half of them women.", "That election will put in place a democratically elected government that will take over next December.", "We've made enormous progress in Afghanistan, in exactly the right direction, in spite of what John Edwards said two and a half years ago.", "He just got it wrong.", "The fact is, as we go forward in Afghanistan, we will pursue Osama bin Laden and the terrorists as long as necessary.", "We're standing up Afghan security forces so they can take on responsibility for their own security.", "We'll keep U.S. forces there -- we have about 16,000 there today -- as long as necessary, to assist the Afghans in terms of dealing with their security situation.", "But they're making significant progress.", "We have President Karzai, who is in power.", "They have done wonders writing their own constitution for the first time ever.", "Schools are open.", "Young girls are going to school.", "Women are going to vote.", "Women are even eligible to run for office.", "This is major, major progress.", "There will be democracy in Afghanistan, make no doubt about it.", "Freedom is the best antidote to terror.", " Someone did get it wrong.", "But it wasn't John Kerry and John Edwards.", "They got it wrong.", "When we had Osama bin Laden cornered, they left the job to the Afghan warlords.", "They then diverted their attention from the very people who attacked us, who were at the center of the war on terror, and so Osama bin Laden is still at large.", "Now, I want to go back to something the vice president said just a minute ago, because these distortions are continuing.", "He said that -- made mention of this global test.", "What John Kerry said -- and it's just as clear as day to anybody who was listening -- he said: We will find terrorists where they are and kill them before they ever do harm to the American people, first.", "We will keep this country safe.", "He defended this country as a young man, he will defend this country as president of the United States.", "He also said very clearly that he will never give any country veto power over the security of the United States of America.", "Now, I know the vice president would like to pretend that wasn't said, and the president would too.", "But the reality is it was said.", "Here's what's actually happened in Afghanistan, regardless of this rosy scenario that they paint on Afghanistan, just like they do with Iraq.", "What's actually happened is they're now providing 75 percent of the world's opium.", "Not only are they providing 75 percent of the world's opium, large-cut parts of the country are under the control of drug lords and warlords.", "Big parts of the country are still insecure.", "And the reality is the part of Afghanistan, eastern Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is, is one of the hardest places to control and the most insecure, Gwen.", " Twenty years ago we had a similar situation in El Salvador.", "We had -- guerrilla insurgency controlled roughly a third of the country, 75,000 people dead, and we held free elections.", "I was there as an observer on behalf of the Congress.", "The human drive for freedom, the determination of these people to vote, was unbelievable.", "And the terrorists would come in and shoot up polling places; as soon as they left, the voters would come back and get in line and would not be denied the right to vote.", "And today El Salvador is a whale of a lot better because we held free elections.", "The power of that concept is enormous.", "And it will apply in Afghanistan, and it will apply as well in Iraq.", " The vice president just said that we should focus on state sponsors of terrorism.", "Iran has moved forward with its nuclear weapons program.", "They're more dangerous today than they were four years ago.", "North Korea has moved forward with their nuclear weapons program, gone from one to two nuclear weapons to six to eight nuclear weapons.", "This vice president has been an advocate for over a decade for lifting sanctions against Iran, the largest state sponsor of terrorism on the planet.", "It's a mistake.", "We should not only not lift them, we should strengthen those sanctions.", " Sure.", " Well, let me say, first, he said in the same segment -- I don't remember precisely where it was connected with what you just read -- but he said, point blank, \"We will never give anyone a veto over the security of the United States of America.\"", "What he's saying is we're going to go back to the proud tradition of the United States of America and presidents of the United States of America for the last 50 to 75 years.", "First, we're going to actually tell the American people the truth.", "We're going to tell them the truth about what's happening.", "We're not going to suggest to them that things are going well in Iraq or anyplace else when, in fact, they're not.", "We're going to make sure that the American people know the truth about why we are using force and what the explanation for it is.", "And it's not just the American people.", "We're also going to make sure that we tell the world the truth.", "Because the reality is, for America to lead, for America to do what it's done for 50 years before this president and vice president came into office, it is critical that we be credible.", "It is critical that they believe that when America takes action, they can trust what we're doing, what we say, what we say at the United Nations, what we say in direct conversations with leaders of the world -- of other countries.", "They need to know that the credibility of the United States is always good, because they will not follow us without that.", "And unfortunately, we're seeing the consequences of that right now.", "It's one of the reasons that we're having so much difficulty getting others involved in the effort in Iraq.", "You know, we've taken 90 percent of the coalition casualties.", "American taxpayers have borne 90 percent of the costs of the effort in Iraq.", "And we see the result of there not being a coalition: The first Gulf war cost America $5 billion.", "We're at $200 billion and counting.", "John Kerry will never give up control over the security of the United States of America to any other country.", "We will not outsource our responsibility to keep this country safe.", " Well, Gwen, the 90 percent figure is just dead wrong.", "When you include the Iraqi security forces that have suffered casualties, as well as the allies, they've taken almost 50 percent of the casualties in operations in Iraq, which leaves the U.S. with 50 percent, not 90 percent.", "With respect to the cost, it wasn't $200 billion.", "You probably weren't there to vote for that.", "But $120 billion is, in fact, what has been allocated to Iraq.", "The rest of it's for Afghanistan and the global war on terror.", "The allies have stepped forward and agreed to reduce and forgive Iraqi debt to the tune of nearly $80 billion by one estimate.", "That, plus $14 billion they promised in terms of direct aid, puts the overall allied contribution financially at about $95 billion, not to the $120 billion we've got, but, you know, better than 40 percent.", "So your facts are just wrong, Senator.", "You also have a situation where you talk about credibility.", "It's awfully hard to convey a sense of credibility to allies when you voted for the war and then you declared: Wrong war, wrong place, wrong time.", "You voted for the war, and then you voted against supporting the troops when they needed the equipment, the fuel, the spare parts and the ammunition and the body armor.", "You're not credible on Iraq because of the enormous inconsistencies that John Kerry and you have cited time after time after time during the course of the campaign.", "Whatever the political pressures of the moment requires, that's where you're at.", "But you've not been consistent, and there's no indication at all that John Kerry has the conviction to successfully carry through on the war on terror.", " May I respond briefly?", "What the vice president has just said is just a complete distortion.", "The American people saw John Kerry on Thursday night.", "They don't need the vice president or the president to tell them what they saw.", "They saw a man who was strong, who had conviction, who is resolute, who made it very clear that he will do everything that has to be done to find terrorists, to keep the American people safe.", "He laid out his plan for success in Iraq, made it clear that we were committed to success in Iraq.", "We have to be, because we have troops on the ground there and because they have created a haven for terrorists.", " Your rhetoric, Senator, would be a lot more credible if there was a record to back it up.", "There isn't.", "And you cannot use \"talk tough\" during the course of a 90-minute debate in a presidential campaign to obscure a 30-year record in the United States Senate and, prior to that by John Kerry, who has consistently come down on the wrong side of all the major defense issues that he's faced as a public official.", " I'm saying specifically that I don't believe he has the qualities we need in a commander in chief because I don't think, based on his record, that he would pursue the kind of aggressive policies that need to be pursued if we're going to defeat these terrorists.", "We need to battle them overseas so we don't have to battle them here at home.", "I'm not challenging John Kerry's patriotism.", "I said in my acceptance speech in New York City at the Republican convention that we respected his service in Vietnam, and I got applause for that.", "We've never criticized his patriotism.", "What we've questioned is his judgment.", "And his judgment's flawed, and the record's there for anybody who wants to look at it.", "In 1984, when he ran for the Senate he opposed, or called for the elimination of a great many major weapons systems that were crucial to winning the Cold War and are important today to our overall forces.", "When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and occupied it in 1990 and '91, he stood up on the floor of the Senate and voted against going in to liberate Kuwait and push Saddam Hussein back to Iraq.", "The problem we have is that, if you look at his record, he doesn't display the qualities of somebody who has conviction.", "And with respect to this particular operation, we've seen a situation in which, first, they voted to commit the troops, to send them to war, John Edwards and John Kerry, then they came back and when the question was whether or not you provide them with the resources they needed -- body armor, spare parts, ammunition -- they voted against it.", "I couldn't figure out why that happened initially.", "And then I looked and figured out that what was happening was Howard Dean was making major progress in the Democratic primaries, running away with the primaries based on an anti-war record.", "So they, in effect, decided they would cast an anti-war vote and they voted against the troops.", "Now if they couldn't stand up to the pressures that Howard Dean represented, how can we expect them to stand up to Al Qaida?", " Thank you.", "One thing that's very clear is that a long resume does not equal good judgment.", "I mean, we've seen over and over and over the misjudgments made by this administration.", "I want to go back to what the vice president just said, because it's a continuation of the things he's been doing, unfortunately, on the campaign trail; it's a continuation of what he began his first answer with tonight.", "John Kerry has voted for the biggest military appropriations bill in the country's history.", "John Kerry has voted for the biggest intelligence appropriations in the country's history.", "This vice president, when he was secretary of defense, cut over 80 weapons systems, including the very ones he's criticizing John Kerry for voting against.", "These are weapons systems, a big chunk of which, the vice president himself suggested we get rid of after the Cold War.", "The reality is that John Kerry has consistently supported the very men that he served with in Vietnam and led.", "On the $87 billion, it was clear at the time of that vote that they had no plan to win the peace.", "We're seeing the consequences of that everyday on the ground right now.", "We stood up and said: For our troops, we must have a plan to win the peace.", "We also thought it was wrong to have a $20 billion fund out of which $7.5 billion was going to go to a no-bid contract for Halliburton, the vice president's former company.", "It was wrong then.", "It's wrong now.", " Well, Gwen, I think the record speaks for itself.", "These are two individuals who have been for the war when the headlines were good and against it when their poll ratings were bad.", "We have not seen the kind of consistency that a commander in chief has to have in order to be a leader in wartime and in order to be able to see the strategy through to victory.", "If we want to win the war on terror, it seems to me it's pretty clear the choice is George Bush, not John Kerry.", " John Kerry has been absolutely clear and consistent from the beginning that we must stay focused on the people who attacked us; that Saddam Hussein was a threat that needed to be addressed directly; that the weapons inspectors needed to have time to do their job.", "Had they had time to do their job, they would have discovered what we now know, that in fact Saddam Hussein had no weapons, that in fact Saddam Hussein has no connection with 9/11, that in fact Saddam Hussein has little or no connection with Al Qaida.", " Well, let's start with what we know.", "What we know is that the president and the vice president have not done the work to build the coalition that we need -- dramatically different than the first Gulf War.", "We know that they haven't done it, and we know they can't do it.", "They didn't, by the way, just reject the allies going into lead- up to the war.", "They also rejected them in the effort to do the reconstruction in Iraq, and that has consequences.", "What we believe is, as part of our entire plan for Iraq -- and we have a plan for Iraq.", "They have a plan for Iraq too: more of the same.", "We have a plan for success.", "And that plan includes speeding up the training of the military.", "We have less than half of the staff that we need there to complete that training.", "Second, make sure that the reconstruction is sped up in a way that the Iraqis see some tangible benefit for what's happening.", "And by the way, if we need to, we can take Iraqis out of Iraq to train them.", "It is not secure enough.", "It's so dangerous on the ground that they can't be trained there.", "We can take them out of Iraq for purposes of training.", "We should do whatever has to be done to train the Iraqis and to speed up that process.", "That works in conjunction with making sure the elections take place on time.", "Right now, the United Nations, which is responsible for the elections in January, has about 35 people there.", "Now, that's compared with a much smaller country like East Timor, where they had over 200 people on the ground.", "You need more than 35 people to hold an election in Cleveland, much less in Iraq.", "And they keep saying the election's on schedule, this is going to happen.", "The reality is we need a new president with credibility with the rest of the world and who has a real plan for success.", "Success breeds contribution, breeds joining the coalition.", "Not only that, I want to go back to what the vice president said.", "He attacks us about the troops.", "They sent 40,000 American troops into Iraq without the body armor they needed.", "They sent them without the armored vehicles they needed.", "While they were on the ground fighting, they lobbied the Congress to cut their combat pay.", "This is the height of hypocrisy.", " Well, Gwen, it's hard to know where to start; there are so many inaccuracies there.", "The fact of the matter is the troops wouldn't have what they have today if you guys had had your way.", "You talk about internationalizing the effort.", "They don't have a plan.", "Basically, it's an echo.", "You made the comment that the Gulf War coalition in '91 was far stronger than this.", "No.", "We had 34 countries then; we've got 30 today.", "We've got troops beside us.", "It's hard, after John Kerry referred to our allies as a coalition of the coerced and the bribed, to go out and persuade people to send troops and to participate in this process.", "You end up with a situation in which -- talk about demeaning.", "In effect, you demean the sacrifice of our allies when you say it's the wrong war, wrong place, wrong time, and oh, by the way, send troops.", "Makes no sense at all.", "It's totally inconsistent.", "There isn't a plan there.", "Our most important ally in the war on terror, in Iraq specifically, is Prime Minister Allawi.", "He came recently and addressed a joint session of Congress that I presided over with the speaker of the House.", "And John Kerry rushed out immediately after his speech was over with, where he came and he thanked America for our contributions and our sacrifice and pledged to hold those elections in January, went out and demeaned him, criticized him, challenged his credibility.", "That is not the way to win friends and allies.", "You're never going to add to the coalition with that kind of attitude.", " Thank you.", "The vice president suggests that we have the same number of countries involved now that we had in the first Gulf War.", "The first Gulf War cost the American people $5 billion.", "And regardless of what the vice president says, we're at $200 billion and counting.", "Not only that, 90 percent of the coalition casualties, Mr. Vice President, the coalition casualties, are American casualties.", "Ninety percent of the cost of this effort are being borne by American taxpayers.", "It is the direct result of the failures of this administration.", " Classic example.", "He won't count the sacrifice and the contribution of Iraqi allies.", "It's their country.", "They're in the fight.", "They're increasingly the ones out there putting their necks on the line to take back their country from the terrorists and the old regime elements that are still left.", "They're doing a superb job.", "And for you to demean their sacrifices strikes me as...", " Oh, I'm not...", " ... as beyond...", " I'm not demeaning...", " It is indeed.", "You suggested...", " No, sir, I did not...", " ... somehow they shouldn't count, because you want to be able to say that the Americans are taking 90 percent of the sacrifice.", "You cannot succeed in this effort if you're not willing to recognize the enormous contribution the Iraqis are increasingly making to their own future.", "We'll win when they take on responsibility for governance, which they're doing, and when the take on responsibility for their own security, which they increasingly are doing.", " Thanks.", " Well, let me speak, first of all, to what the vice president just said, and then I'll answer that question.", "This, unfortunately -- what the vice president is telling people is inconsistent with everything they see every single day.", "It's a continuation of, \"Well, there's a strong connection between Al Qaida and Saddam Hussein.\"", "It's not true.", "It's a continuation of at least insinuating that there's some connection between 9/11 and Saddam Hussein.", "It's not true.", "It's saying to the American people, as the president said last Thursday, and the vice president continues to say tonight, that things are going well in Iraq, contrary to what people who have been there have seen, including Republican leaders, contrary to what everyone in America sees on their television every day -- Americans being kidnapped, people being beheaded, parts of the country under the control of insurgents, even today, under the control of the insurgents.", "The vice president has still not said anything about what Mr. Bremer said, about the failure to have adequate troops, the failure to be able to secure the country in the short term.", "You know, remember \"shock and awe\"?", "Look at where we are now.", "It is a direct result of the failure to plan, the failure to have others involved in this effort.", "This is not an accident.", "Now, let me go back to your question.", "If we want to do the things that need to be done to keep this country safe, we can't be dragged kicking and screaming to it.", "One thing that everybody does agree on is that 9/11 did change things.", "But what's happened is this administration opposed the creation of a 9/11 Commission to find out why it happened and what we needed to do.", "They opposed the creation of a Department of Homeland Security, and then they were for it.", "We can't react that way.", "We must be more aggressive.", "With John Kerry as president of the United States, we are committed to immediately implementing all of the reforms suggested by the 9/11 Commission, so that we have the information we need to find terrorists and crush them before they hurt us.", " Gwen, the story that appeared today about this report is one I asked for.", "I ask an awful lot of questions as part of my job as vice president.", "A CIA spokesman was quoted in that story as saying they had not yet reached the bottom line and there is still debate over this question of the relationship between Zarqawi and Saddam Hussein.", "The report also points out that at one point some of Zarqawi's people were arrested.", "Saddam personally intervened to have them released, supposedly at the request of Zarqawi  But let's look at what we know about Mr. Zarqawi.", "We know he was running a terrorist camp, training terrorists in Afghanistan prior to 9/11.", "We know that when we went into Afghanistan that he then migrated to Baghdad.", "He set up shop in Baghdad, where he oversaw the poisons facility up at Khurmal (ph), where the terrorists were developing ricin and other deadly substances to use.", "We know he's still in Baghdad today.", "He is responsible for most of the major car bombings that have killed or maimed thousands of people.", "He's the one you will see on the evening news beheading hostages.", "He is, without question, a bad guy.", "He is, without question, a terrorist.", "He was, in fact, in Baghdad before the war, and he's in Baghdad now after the war.", "The fact of the matter is that this is exactly the kind of track record we've seen over the years.", "We have to deal with Zarqawi by taking him out, and that's exactly what we'll do.", " No, I do not.", "And, Gwen, at the time, I was talking specifically about this question of unilateral sanctions.", "What happens when we impose unilateral sanctions is, unless there's a collective effort, then other people move in and take advantage of the situation and you don't have any impact, except to penalize American companies.", "We've got sanctions on Iran now.", "We may well want to go to the U.N. Security Council and ask for even tougher sanctions if they don't live up to their obligations under the initial -- International Atomic Energy Agency Non-Proliferation Treaty.", "We dealt with Iran differently than we have Iraq partly because Iran has not yet, as Iraq did, violated 12 years of resolutions by the U.N. Security Council.", "We're working with the Brits and the Germans and the French, who've been negotiating with the Iranians.", "We recently were actively involved in a meeting with the board of governors in the International Atomic Energy Agency.", "And as I say, there will be a follow-up meeting in November to determine whether or not Iran's living up to their commitments and obligations.", "And if they aren't, my guess is then the board of governors will recommend sending the whole matter to the U.N. Security Council for the application of the international sanctions, which I think would be exactly the right way to go.", "We're addressing North Korea on a similar basis, working with the Chinese, the South Koreans, the Japanese and others to try to bring them around.", "One of the great by-products, for example, of what we did in Iraq and Afghanistan is that five days after we captured Saddam Hussein, Moammar Gadhafi in Libya came forward and announced that he was going to surrender all of his nuclear materials to the United States, which he has done.", "This was one of the biggest sources of proliferation in the world today in terms of the threat that was represented by that.", "The suppliers network that provided that, headed by Mr. A.Q.", "Khan, has been shut down.", "We've made major progress in dealing here with a major issue with respect to nuclear proliferation.", "And we'll continue to press very hard on the North Koreans and the Iranians as well.", " Well, the vice president talks about there being a member, or someone associated with Al Qaida, in Iraq.", "There are 60 countries who have members of Al Qaida in them.", "How many of those countries are we going to invade?", "Not only that, he talks about Iran.", "The reality about Iran is that Iran has moved forward with their nuclear weapons program on their watch.", "They ceded responsibility to dealing with it to the Europeans.", "Now, the vice president, as you pointed out, spoke out loudly for lifting the sanctions on Iraq.", "John Kerry and I believe we need to strengthen the sanctions on Iraq, including closing the loophole that allows companies to use a subsidiary, offshore subsidiaries to do business with Iran.", "I mentioned Halliburton a few minute ago in connection with the $87 billion, and you raised it in this question.", "This is relevant, because he was pushing for lifting sanctions when he was CEO of Halliburton.", "Here's why we didn't think Halliburton should have a no-bid contract.", "While he was CEO of Halliburton, they paid millions of dollars in fines for providing false information on their company, just like Enron and Ken Lay.", "They did business with Libya and Iran, two sworn enemies of the United States.", "They're now under investigation for having bribed foreign officials during that period of time.", "Not only that, they've gotten a $7.5 billion no-bid contract in Iraq, and instead of part of their money being withheld, which is the way it's normally done, because they're under investigation, they've continued to get their money.", " I can respond, Gwen, but it's going to take more than 30 seconds.", " Well, the reason they keep mentioning Halliburton is because they're trying to throw up a smokescreen.", "They know the charges are false.", "They know that if you go, for example, to factcheck.com (sic), an independent Web site sponsored by the University of Pennsylvania, you can get the specific details with respect to Halliburton.", "It's an effort that they've made repeatedly to try to confuse the voters and to raise questions, but there's no substance to the charges.", " These are the facts.", "The facts are the vice president's company that he was CEO of, that did business with sworn enemies of the United States, paid millions of dollars in fines for providing false financial information, is under investigation for bribing foreign officials.", "The same company that got a $7.5 billion no-bid contract, the rule is that part of their money is supposed to be withheld when they're under investigation, as they are now, for having overcharged the American taxpayer, but they're getting every dime of their money.", "I'm happy to let voters make their own decision about this.", " Well, first of all, I do agree that we've been largely absent, not entirely absent, but largely absent from the peace-making process over the last four years.", "And let me just say a couple of preliminary things and then talk about where we are now.", "First, the Israeli people not only have the right to defend themselves, they should defend themselves.", "They have an obligation to defend themselves.", "I mean, if I can, just for a moment, tell you a personal story.", "I was in Jerusalem a couple of years ago, actually three years ago, in August of 2001, staying at the King David Hotel.", "We left in the morning, headed to the airport to leave, and later in the day I found out that that same day, not far from where we were staying, the Sbarro Pizzeria was hit by a suicide bomber in Jerusalem.", "Fifteen people were killed.", "Six children were killed.", "What are the Israeli people supposed to do?", "How can they continue to watch Israeli children killed by suicide bombers, killed by terrorists?", "They have not only the right but the obligation to defend themselves.", "Now, we know that the prime minister has made a decision, a historic decision, to unilaterally withdraw from Gaza.", "It's important for America to participate in helping with that process.", "Now, if Gaza's being used as a platform for attacking the Israeli people, that has to be stopped.", "And Israel has a right to defend itself.", "They don't have a partner for peace right now.", "They certainly don't have a partner in Arafat, and they need a legitimate partner for peace.", "And I might add, it is very important for America to crack down on the Saudis who have not had a public prosecution for financing terrorism since 9/11.", "And it's important for America to confront the situation in Iran, because Iran is an enormous threat to Israel and to the Israeli people.", " Gwen, I want to go back to the last comment, and then I'll come back to Israel-Palestine.", "The reason they keep trying to attack Halliburton is because they want to obscure their own record.", "And Senator, frankly, you have a record in the Senate that's not very distinguished.", "You've missed 33 out of 36 meetings in the Judiciary Committee, almost 70 percent of the meetings of the Intelligence Committee.", "You've missed a lot of key votes: on tax policy, on energy, on Medicare reform.", "Your hometown newspaper has taken to calling you \"Senator Gone.\"", "You've got one of the worst attendance records in the United States Senate.", "Now, in my capacity as vice president, I am the president of Senate, the presiding officer.", "I'm up in the Senate most Tuesdays when they're in session.", "The first time I ever met you was when you walked on the stage tonight.", "In respect to Israel and Palestine, Gwen, the suicide bombers, in part, were generated by Saddam Hussein, who paid $25,000 to the families of suicide bombers.", "I personally think one of the reasons that we don't have as many suicide attacks today in Israel as we've had in the past is because Saddam is no longer in business.", "We've been strong supporters of Israel.", "The president stepped forward and put in place a policy basically that said we will support the establishment of two states.", "First president ever to say we'll establish and support a Palestinian state nextdoor to Israelis.", "But first, there has to be an interlocutor you can trust and deal with.", "And we won't have that, we don't have it now, in a Yasser Arafat.", "There has to be reform of the Palestinian system.", " That was a complete distortion of my record.", "I know that won't come as a shock.", "The vice president, I'm surprised to hear him talk about records.", "When he was one of 435 members of the United States House, he was one of 10 to vote against Head Start, one of four to vote against banning plastic weapons that can pass through metal detectors.", "He voted against the Department of Education.", "He voted against funding for Meals on Wheels for seniors.", "He voted against a holiday for Martin Luther King.", "He voted against a resolution calling for the release of Nelson Mandela in South Africa.", "It's amazing to hear him criticize either my record or John Kerry's.", " Oh, I think his record speaks for itself.", "And frankly, it's not very distinguished.", " I think it goes to Senator Edwards.", " I concede the point.", "(LAUGHTER)", " No, I did talk about it, Israel.", "He's the one who didn't talk about it.", " Well, Gwen, there are several things that I think need to be done and are being done.", "We've, of course, been through a difficult recession, and then the aftermath of 9/11, where we lost over a million jobs after that attack.", "But we think the key is to address some basic, fundamental issues that the president's already working on.", "I think probably the most successful thing we can do with respect to ending poverty is to get people jobs.", "There's no better antidote to poverty than a good, well-paying job that allows somebody to take care of their own family.", "To do that, we have to make America the best place in the world to do business.", "And that means we've got to deal effectively with tax policy.", "We've got to reduce the litigation costs that are built into our society.", "We've got to provide the adequate medical care and make certain that we can, in fact, create the opportunities that are vital to that process.", "I'd zero in, in particular, on education.", "I think the most important thing we can do is have a first-class public school system.", "I'm a product of public schools.", "And the president, his first legislative priority was the No Child Left Behind Act.", "It was the first piece of legislation we introduced.", "We got it passed that first summer on a bipartisan basis.", "We even had Ted Kennedy on board for the effort.", "And it does several things.", "It establishes high standards.", "It, at the same time, sets up a system of testing with respect to our school system, so we can establish accountability to parents and make certain that they understand how well their students are doing.", "And they have the opportunity to move students out of poorly performing schools to good schools.", "It strikes me that that is absolutely the heart of what needs to be done from the standpoint of education.", "It's also important, as we go forward in the next term, we want to be able to take what we've done for elementary education and move it into the secondary education.", "It's working.", "We've seen reports now of a reduction in the achievement gap between majority students and minority students.", "We're making significant progress.", " Gwen, your question was about jobs?", " I thought it was about jobs and poverty.", "I hope we get a chance to talk about education, but that's what the vice president talked about.", "Here's what's happened: In the time that they have been in office, in the last four years, 1.6 million private sector jobs have been lost, 2.7 million manufacturing jobs have been lost.", "And it's had real consequences in places like Cleveland.", "Cleveland is a wonderful, distinguished city that's done a lot of great things, but it has the highest poverty rate in the country.", "One out of almost two children in Cleveland are now living in poverty.", "During the time that the vice president and the president have been in office, 4 million more Americans have fallen into poverty.", "During the time that the vice president and the president have been in office, 4 million more Americans have fallen into poverty.", "And what the most striking and startling thing is, they are the first presidency in 70 years -- and I'm talking Democrats, Republican, presidents who led us through World War, through the Korean War, the Vietnam War, Cold War -- every one of them created jobs until this president.", "We have to do better.", "We have a plan.", "We're going to get rid of -- by the way, they're for outsourcing jobs.", "I want to make sure people hear that, the fundamental difference with us.", "The administration says over and over that the outsourcing of millions of American jobs is good.", "We're against it.", "We want to get rid of tax cuts for companies sending jobs overseas.", "We want to balance this budget, get back to fiscal responsibility.", "And we want to invest in the creative, innovative jobs of the future.", " Gwen, we've got 111 million American taxpayers that have benefited from our income tax cuts.", "We've got 33 million students who've benefited from No Child Left Behind.", "We've got 40 million seniors who benefited from the reform of the Medicare system.", "The Democrats promised prescription drug benefits.", "For years they've run on that platform.", "They never got it done.", "The president got it done.", "We also dropped 5 million people totally off the federal income tax rolls, so they no longer have to pay any federal income tax at all.", "So the story, I think, is a good one.", "And the data he's using is old data.", "It's from 2003.", "It doesn't include any of the gains that we've made in the last years.", "We've added 1.7 million jobs to the economy.", " The vice president and president like to talk about their experience on the campaign trail.", "Millions of people have lost their jobs.", "Millions have fallen into poverty.", "Family incomes are down, while the cost of everything is going up.", "Medical costs are up the highest they've ever been over the last four years.", "We have this mess in Iraq.", "Mr. Vice President, I don't think the country can take four more years of this kind of experience.", " Because we will do what they've not done.", "You know, if you look at what's happened over the last four years, we have gone from a $5 trillion projected surplus when George Bush took office to a $3 trillion projected deficit.", "They promised they were going to put $2 trillion of the surplus aside from Social Security.", "Not done.", "Not only that, it's the biggest fiscal turnaround in American history.", "And there's no end in sight.", "The Washington Post just reported they have several trillion dollars of additional tax cuts and spending, no suggestion of what they're going to do about it.", "John Kerry and I believe we have a moral responsibility not to leave trillions of debt to our children and our grandchildren.", "So here's what we're going to do, to answer your question.", "To pay for the things that we believe need to be done -- and I hope to get the chance to talk about health care and also about education, because we have plans on both of those subjects -- what we're going to do is roll back tax cuts.", "And I want everyone to hear this, because there have been exaggerations made on the campaign trail: Roll back tax cuts for people who make over $200,000 a year; we will do that.", "We want to keep the tax cuts that are in place for people who make less than $200,000 a year and give additional tax cuts to those middle-class families, tax cuts for health care, tax cuts to help families pay for their college tuition, tax cuts for child care.", "These families are struggling and hurting, and they need more tax relief, not less tax relief.", "But to help get us back on the path to a balanced budget, we also want to get rid of some of the bureaucratic spending in Washington.", "One of the amazing things that's happened is they've actually layered on more supervisory people, people at the supervisory level, in this government.", "We also want to close some corporate loopholes.", "Now, I want to be honest with people.", "We can't eliminate this deficit.", "People have heard that over and over and over in four years.", "We cannot do it.", "We're in too deep a hole.", "But we can cut the deficit in half.", "And if we move, we can move this country back on a path to fiscal responsibility.", " Gwen, the Kerry record on taxes is one basically of voting for a large number of tax increases -- 98 times in the United States Senate.", "There's a fundamental philosophical difference here between the president and myself, who believe that we ought to let the American people keep more of what they earn and we ought to empower them to have more control over their own lives -- I think the Kerry-Edwards approach basically is to raise taxes and to give government more control over the lives of individual citizens.", "We think that's the wrong way to go.", "There's a fundamental difference of opinion here.", "They talk about the top bracket and going after only those people in the top bracket.", "Well, the fact of the matter is a great many of our small businesses pay taxes under the personal income taxes rather than the corporate rate.", "And about 900,000 small businesses will be hit if you do, in fact, do what they want to do with the top bracket.", "That's not smart because seven out of 10 new jobs in America are created by small businesses.", "You do not want to tax them.", "It's a bad idea to increase the burden on those folks.", "The senator himself said, during the course of the primaries, that the Kerry plan would drive us deeper into deficit.", "Those were the senator's words about his running-mate.", "The fact of the matter is, the president and I will go forward to make the tax cuts permanent.", "That's good policy.", "That's what we ought to do.", "But with fiscal restraint, we'll also drive the deficit down 50 percent in the course of the next five years.", " We are committed to cutting back anything in our programs that need to be cut back to get us back on a path to fiscal responsibility.", "John Kerry, Mr. Vice President, has voted or co-sponsored over 600 times tax cuts for the American people -- over 600 times.", "And there is a philosophical difference between us and them.", "We are for more tax cuts for the middle class than they're for, have been for the last four years.", "But we are not for more tax cuts for multimillionaires.", "They are.", "And it is a fundamental difference in what we think needs to be done in this country.", " Yesterday, the president signed an extension of middle- class tax cuts, the 10 percent bracket, the marriage penalty relief and the increase in the child tax credit.", "Senators Kerry and Edwards weren't even there to vote for it when it came to final passage.", " Gwen, you're right, four years ago in this debate, the subject came up.", "And I said then and I believe today that freedom does mean freedom for everybody.", "People ought to be free to choose any arrangement they want.", "It's really no one else's business.", "That's a separate question from the issue of whether or not government should sanction or approve or give some sort of authorization, if you will, to these relationships.", "Traditionally, that's been an issue for the states.", "States have regulated marriage, if you will.", "That would be my preference.", "In effect, what's happened is that in recent months, especially in Massachusetts, but also in California, but in Massachusetts we had the Massachusetts Supreme Court direct the state of -- the legislature of Massachusetts to modify their constitution to allow gay marriage.", "And the fact is that the president felt that it was important to make it clear that that's the wrong way to go, as far as he's concerned.", "Now, he sets the policy for this administration, and I support the president.", " Yes.", "Let me say first, on an issue that the vice president said in his last answer before we got to this question, talking about tax policy, the country needs to know that under what they have put in place and want to put in place, a millionaire sitting by their swimming pool, collecting their statements to see how much money they're making, make their money from dividends, pays a lower tax rate than the men and women who are receiving paychecks for serving on the ground in Iraq.", "Now, they may think that's right.", "John Kerry and I do not.", "We don't just value wealth, which they do.", "We value work in this country.", "And it is a fundamental value difference between them and us.", "Now, as to this question, let me say first that I think the vice president and his wife love their daughter.", "I think they love her very much.", "And you can't have anything but respect for the fact that they're willing to talk about the fact that they have a gay daughter, the fact that they embrace her.", "It's a wonderful thing.", "And there are millions of parents like that who love their children, who want their children to be happy.", "And I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman, and so does John Kerry.", "I also believe that there should be partnership benefits for gay and lesbian couples in long-term, committed relationships.", "But we should not use the Constitution to divide this country.", "No state for the last 200 years has ever had to recognize another state's marriage.", "This is using the Constitution as a political tool, and it's wrong.", " No.", "I think we've both said the same thing all along.", "We both believe that -- and this goes onto the end of what I just talked about -- we both believe that marriage is between a man and a woman.", "But we also believe that gay and lesbians and gay and lesbian couples, those who have been in long-term relationships, deserve to be treated respectfully, they deserve to have benefits.", "For example, a gay couple now has a very difficult time, one, visiting the other when they're in the hospital, or, for example, if, heaven forbid, one of them were to pass away, they have trouble even arranging the funeral.", "I mean, those are not the kind of things that John Kerry and I believe in.", "I suspect the vice president himself does not believe in that.", "But we don't -- we do believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman.", "And I want to go back, if I can, to the question you just asked, which is this constitutional amendment.", "I want to make sure people understand that the president is proposing a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage that is completely unnecessary.", "Under the law of this country for the last 200 years, no state has been required to recognize another state's marriage.", "Let me just be simple about this.", "My state of North Carolina would not be required to recognize a marriage from Massachusetts, which you just asked about.", "There is absolutely no purpose in the law and in reality for this amendment.", "It's nothing but a political tool.", "And it's being used in an effort to divide this country on an issue that we should not be dividing America on.", "We ought to be talking about issues like health care and jobs and what's happening in Iraq, not using an issue to divide this country in a way that's solely for political purposes.", "It's wrong.", " Well, Gwen, let me simply thank the senator for the kind words he said about my family and our daughter.", "I appreciate that very much.", " That's it.", " Well, Gwen...", " First of all, I'm not familiar with his cases.", "My concern is specifically with what's happened to our medical care system because of rising malpractice insurance rates, because we failed to adequately reform our medical liability structure.", "I was in New Mexico the other day and met with a group of OB/GYN docs.", "And they were deeply concerned because they were fearful that there'd be another increase in malpractice insurance rates as a result of what they believe are frivolous lawsuits and that that would put them out of business.", "And one doctor indicated that her rates have gone up so much that she's now to the point where she is screening patients.", "She won't take high-risk patients anymore because of the danger that that will generate a lawsuit, and a lawsuit will put her out of business.", "This has had a devastating impact in a lot of communities.", "My home state of Wyoming, we've lost the top insurer of malpractice insurance in the state.", "The rates for a general practitioner have gone from $40,000 a year to $100,000 a year for an insurance policy.", "We think this has a devastating impact on the quality of health care.", "As I say, high risk patients don't get covered anymore.", "We've lost one out of eleven OB/GYN practitioners in the country.", "We think it can be fixed, needs to be fixed.", "Now, specifically, what we need to do is cap non-economic damages, and we also think you need to limit the awards that the trial attorneys take out of all of this.", "Over 50 percent of the settlements go to the attorneys and for administrating overhead.", "We passed medical liability reform through the House of Representatives.", "It's been blocked in the Senate.", "Senator Kerry's voted 10 times against medical liability reform, and I don't believe Senator Edwards supports it, either, not the kind that would be meaningful.", " Yes.", "Well let me say, first of all, I'm proud of the work I did on behalf of kids and families against big insurance companies, big drug companies and big HMOs.", "We do have too many lawsuits.", "And the reality is there's something that we can do about it.", "John Kerry and I have a plan to do something about it.", "We want to put more responsibility on the lawyers to require, before a case, malpractice, which the vice president just spoke about, have the case reviewed by independent experts to determine if the case is serious and meritorious before it can be filed; hold the lawyers responsible for that, certify that and hold the lawyer financially responsible if they don't do it; have a three-strikes-and-you're-out rule so that a lawyer who files three of these cases without meeting this requirement loses their right to file these cases.", "That way we keep the cases out of the system that don't belong in the system.", "They talk about frivolous cases.", "We believe cases that don't belong in the system should never be in the system.", "But we don't believe that we should take away the right of people like Valerie Lakey, who was the young girl who I represented, five years old, severely injured for life, on a defective swimming pool drain cover.", "It turns out the company knew of 12 other children who had either been killed or severely injured by the same problem.", "They hid it.", "They didn't tell anybody.", "They could have fixed it with a 2-cent screw.", "That's wrong.", "John Kerry and I are always going to stand with the Valerie Lakeys of the world, and not with the insurance companies.", " Am I personally attacked?", "I think the truth is that what they're doing is talking about an issue that really doesn't have a great deal to do with what's happening with medical cost in this country, which I think is a very serious issue.", "And I would be the first to say that what the vice president described a few minutes ago, problems with malpractice premiums, that's true, it's real.", "It's very real.", "What doctors talk about is very serious.", "And they're getting squeezed from both sides.", "I mean, because, they have trouble getting reimbursed, first of all, for the care that they provide, you know, from the government or from health-care companies.", "And, on the flip side, their malpractice costs are going up.", "That's very real, which is why we have proposed a plan to keep cases out of the system that don't belong there.", "But it's very important to put this in context.", "Because, in context, everything they're proposing, according to the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office, amounts to about half of 1 percent of health-care costs in this country -- half of 1 percent.", "We have double-digit inflation in health care costs.", "We've seen the largest rise in medical costs in the last four years in the country's history: $3,500 nationally.", "And nobody who's watching this debate needs me to explain this to them.", "They know it.", "Medicare premiums are up 17 percent on their watch.", "Again, largest increase in Medicare premiums in the history of Medicare.", "We think we have a plan to keep cases that don't belong in the system out, but we also do what they haven't done.", "Five million Americans have lost their health care coverage.", "Medical costs are skyrocketing.", "We have a serious health care plan to bring down costs for everybody, to cover millions more Americans and to actually stand up to drug companies and insurance companies which this administration has been unwilling to do.", " Gwen, we think lawsuit abuse is a serious problem in this country.", "We think we badly need tort reform.", "I was in Minnesota the other day, where I visited an aircraft manufacturing plant.", "It's a great success story.", "This is a company that started 20 years ago with nothing.", "Today they're the second- leading producer of piston-driven aircraft in the country.", "He told me that if it weren't for the increased cost of his liability insurance, in this case product liability, he could hire 200 more people in his factory.", "We've built into the system enormous costs as a result of our practice with respect to litigation.", "We have to find ways to get a handle on it.", "He mentioned Medicare up 17 percent, somehow that that was something we caused.", "No.", "The 17 percent increase in Medicare premiums was the direct result of a statute adopted in 1997.", "John Kerry voted for it.", "It establishes the formula for Part B of Medicare that says, in effect, it has to cover 25 percent of the cost of the program.", "And the reason the money had to go into the trust fund was to make certain that we could cover those eligible for benefits.", "While you were in private practice in law and as a senator, you had the advantage of a special tax loophole, Subchapter S corporation, which you set up so you could avoid paying $600,000 in Medicare taxes that would have gone into the fund.", "And it's those kinds of loopholes that necessitate a premium increase under the law that was enacted in 1997, supported by John Kerry.", " Well, first of all, I have paid all the taxes that I owe.", "When the vice president was CEO of Halliburton, they took advantage of every offshore loophole available.", "They had multiple offshore companies that were avoiding taxes.", "Those are the kind of things that ought to be closed.", "They ought to be closed.", "They ought to be closed for anybody.", "They ought to be closed whether they're personal, and they ought to be closed whether they apply to a corporation.", "But the reality is health care costs are going up every day for the American people, and I hope we're going to get a chance to talk more about health care.", " We've done a lot to reduce the cost of health care.", "The Medicare drug benefit that we'll be providing to seniors beginning in '06 will provide upwards to $1,300 a year to help them buy prescription drugs.", "The drug savings -- drug discount card that's now available saves an estimated 15 percent to 30 percent off the cost of prescription drugs for senior citizens.", "So we're moving in as many areas as we can to make certain we hold down and reduce the health care costs.", " Well, this is a great tragedy, Gwen, when you think about the enormous cost here in the United States and around the world of the AIDS epidemic -- pandemic, really.", "Millions of lives lost, millions more infected and facing a very bleak future.", "In some parts of the world, we've got the entire, sort of, productive generation has been eliminated as a result of AIDS, all except for old folks and kids -- nobody to do the basic work that runs an economy.", "The president has been deeply concerned about it.", "He has moved and proposed and gotten through the Congress authorization for $15 billion to help in the international effort, to be targeted in those places where we need to do everything we can, through a combination of education as well as providing the kinds of medicines that will help people control the infection.", "Here in the United States, we've made significant progress.", "I have not heard those numbers with respect to African- American women.", "I was not aware that it was -- that they're in epidemic there, because we have made progress in terms of the overall rate of AIDS infection, and I think primarily through a combination of education and public awareness as well as the development, as a result of research, of drugs that allow people to live longer lives even though they are infected -- obviously we need to do more of that.", " Well, first, with respect to what's happening in Africa and Russia and in other places around the world, the vice president spoke about the $15 billion for AIDS.", "John Kerry and I believe that needs to be doubled.", "And I might add, on the first year of their commitment, they came up significantly short of what they had promised.", "And we probably won't get a chance to talk about Africa.", "Let me just say a couple of things.", "The AIDS epidemic in Africa, which is killing millions and millions of people and is a frightening thing not just for the people of Africa but also for the rest of the world, that, combined with the genocide that we're now seeing in Sudan, are two huge moral issues for the United States of America, which John Kerry spoke about eloquently last Thursday night.", "Here at home we need to do much more.", "And the vice president spoke about doing research, making sure we have the drugs available, making sure that we do everything possible to have prevention.", "But it's a bigger question than that.", "You know, we have 5 million Americans who've lost their health care coverage in the last four years; 45 million Americans without health care coverage.", "We have children who don't have health care coverage.", "If kids and adults don't have access to preventative care, if they're not getting the health care that they need day after day after day, the possibility of not only developing AIDS and having a problem -- having a problem -- a life-threatening problem, but the problem of developing other life-threatening diseases is there every day of their lives.", " The American people want in their president and in their vice president basically three things: They want to know that their president and their vice president will keep them safe.", "They want to know that they have good judgment.", "And they want to know that you'll tell them the truth.", "John Kerry and I will tell the American people the truth.", "During the time that I have served on the Intelligence Committee in the Senate, traveling to some of the places we've talked about tonight -- Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Middle East, Turkey -- meeting with the leaders of NATO, I have a very clear idea of what has to be done to keep this country safe.", "The threats we face: terrorism, killing terrorists and stopping them before they can do damage to us, making sure that we stop the spread of nuclear weapons.", "I agree with John Kerry from Thursday night, that the danger of nuclear weapons getting in the hands of terrorists is one of the greatest threats that America faces.", "But the one thing that we know from this administration is -- and I -- first of all, I don't claim to have the long political resume that Vice President Cheney has.", "That's just the truth, and the American people know that and deserve to know it.", "But what we know from this administration is that a long resume does not equal good judgment.", "Here are the judgments I would make: My first priority would be to keep this country safe.", "I would find terrorists where they are and stop them and kill them before they do harm to us.", "We would stop the spread of nuclear weapons.", "And we would also strengthen this military, which means providing the equipment and training that they need.", "We want to raise the active-duty forces by 40,000, double the special forces so we can find terrorists where they are, and provide the kind of support for families -- health care, housing -- that they deserve while their loved ones are serving and protecting us.", " You want me to answer a question about his qualifications?", " I see.", "Well, I think the important thing in picking a vice president probably varies from president to president.", "Different presidents approach it in different ways.", "When George Bush asked me to sign on, it obviously wasn't because he was worried about carrying Wyoming.", "We got 70 percent of the vote in Wyoming,

him govern, and that's exactly the way he's used me.", "And I think from the perspective of the nation, it's worked in our relationship, in this administration.", "I think it's worked in part because

most important consideration in picking a vice president, somebody who could take over.", " I think the most important thing I've learned from this process is what I now know about John Kerry.", "I knew him before.", "I know him better now.", "He's the one candidate who's led troops in battle.", "He was a prosecutor, putting people behind bars to protect neighborhoods from crime.", "He fought for 100,000 cops on the street, and went with John McCain to Vietnam to find out what happened to our POWs.", "And the American people saw for themselves on Thursday night the strength, resolve, and

think of a lot of words to describe Senator Kerry's position on Iraq; \"consistent\" is not one of them.", "I think if you look at the record from voting for sending the troops then voting against the resources they needed when they got there, then saying I actually voted for the $87 billion before I voted against it, saying in response to a question knowing everything I know now, yes, I would have cast exactly the same vote and then shortly after that saying wrong war, wrong place, wrong time, consistency doesn't come to mind as I consider that record.", "The question of troops is an

change in health care in the last several years was the Medicare reform bill this year.", "It's the most sweeping change in 40 years.", "Medicare used to pay for heart bypass surgery but didn't pay for the prescription drugs that might allow you to avoid it.", "The fact is that when that came up, Senator Kerry and Senator Edwards voted against it.", "It'll provide prescription drug benefits to 40 million senior citizens.", "It's a very, very significant piece of legislation.", " They had a choice on allowing prescription drugs into this country from Canada, of being with the American people

years of the same.", "John Kerry and I believe that we can do better.", "We believe in a strong middle-class in this country.", "That's why we have a plan to create jobs, getting rid of tax cuts for

next decision a president has to make can affect the lives of all of us.", "Now we find ourselves in the midst of a conflict unlike any we've ever known, faced with the possibility that terrorists could smuggle a deadly biological agent or a nuclear weapon into the middle of one of our own cities.", "That threat -- and the presidential leadership needed to deal with it -- is placing a special responsibility on all of you who will decide on November 2nd who will be our commander in chief.", "The only viable option for winning the war on terrorism is the one the president has chosen, to use the power of the United States to aggressively go after the terrorists wherever we find them and also to hold to account states that sponsor terror.", "Now that we've captured or killed thousands of Al Qaida and taken down the regimes of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban, it's important that we stand up democratically elected governments as the only guarantee that they'll never again revert to terrorism or the production of deadly weapons.", "This is the task of our generation.", "And I know firsthand the strength the president brings to it.", "The overall outcome will depend upon the ability of the American people and the strong leadership of the president to meet all the challenges that we'll face in the days and years ahead.", "I'm confident we can do it.", " Yes.", "First of all is to recognize a tremendous economic strength in this country and to set the putting to - back to work of our people as a top priority.", "This is uh - an effort that ought to be done primarily by strong leadership in the White House, the inspiration of our people, the tapping of uh - business, agriculture, industry, labor and government at all levels to work on this uh project.", "We'll never have uh - an end to the inflationary spiral, and we'll never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work.", "There are several things that can be done specifically that are not now being done.", "First of all, to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide uh large numbers of jobs.", "Secondly, we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh - to cooperate with government in matters like housing.", "Here a very small investment of taxpayer's money - in the housing field can bring large numbers of extra jobs, and the guarantee of mortgage loans, and the uh - putting forward of uh - two-0-two programs for housing for older people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exists in the - in the construction industry.", "Another thing is to deal with our - uh needs in the central cities, where the unemployment rate is extremely high: sometimes among minority groups, or those who don't speak English, or who're black, or young people, or - 40 percent of the employment.", "Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah - cha- in - in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work.", "Another very important - uh aspect of our - uh economy would be to increase production in every way possible, uh to hold down - uh taxes on individuals, and to uh shift the tax burdens onto those who have avoided paying taxes in the past.", "These uh - kinds of specific things, uh none of which are being done now, would be a great help in - in reducing uh unemployment.", "There is uh - uh an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very - very succinctly, and that is, to make sure that we have a good relationship between management - business on the one hand, and labor, on the other.", "In a &gt; Transfer interrupted!", "ery high, we might channel specific uh targeted job - job - uh opportunities by paying part of the salary of unemployed people - uh and also sharing with uh - local governments the uh - payment of salaries which would uh - let us cut down the unemployment rate much lower, before we hit the inflationary level.", "But I believe that by the end of the first four years of uh - of the next term we could have the unemployment down to 3 percent adult unemployment, which is about uh - 4 to 4 and a half percent overall uh controlled inflation rate and have a uh balance of growth of about - uh 4 to 6 percent, around 5 percent which would give us a balanced budget.", " Yes, in unemployment that is likely to create additional pressure on prices, how willing are you to consider an incomes policy, in other words, wage and price controls?", " Well - we now have such uh - a low utilization of uh - our productive capacity - uh about 73 percent; I think it's about the lowest since the Great Depression years - and such a high unemployment rate now - uh 7.9 percent - that - uh we have a long way to go in getting people to work before we have the inflationary pressures.", "And I think this would uh - this would be uh easy to accomplish, to get jobs down, without having strong in- inflationary pressures that - that would be necessary.", "I would not favor the uh - payment of uh - of a given fixed income to people unless they are not able to work.", "But with tax incentives for the low-income groups we could build up their uh - income levels uh - above the poverty level and not uh make welfare more uh - profitable than - than work.", " I don't believe that uh that Mr. Carter's been any more specific in this case than he has been on many other instances.", "I notice particularly that he didn't endorse the Humphrey-Hawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform.", "That legislation uh allegedly would help our unemployment, but uh - we all know that it would've controlled our economy, it would've added uh - ten to thirty billion dollars each year in additional expenditures by the Federal Government.", "It would've called for export controls on agricultural products In my judgment the best way to get jobs is to uh - expand the private sector, where five out of six jobs today exist in our economy.", "We can do that by reducing Federal taxes as I proposed uh - about a year ago when I called for a tax reduction of $28 billion - three-quarters of it to go to private uh taxpayers and uh one-quarter to the business sector.", "We could add to jobs in the major metropolitan areas by a proposal that I recommended that would give tax incentives to business to move into the inner city and to expand or to build new plants so that they would take a plant, or expand a plant where people are, and people are currently unemployed.", "We could uh - also uh - help our youths with some of the proposals that uh - would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time just like we give money to young people who are going to college.", "Those are the kind of specifics that I think we have to discuss on these uh - debates, and these are the kind of programs that I'll talk about on my time.", " At the time, Mr. Gannon, that I made the recommendation for a $28 billion tax cut - three-quarters of it to go to individual taxpayers and 25 percent to American business.", "I said at the time that we had to hold the lid an federal spending, that for every dollar of a tax reduction we had to have an equal reduction in federal expenditures - a one-for-one proposition.", "And I recommended that to the Congress with a budget ceiling of three hundred and ninety-five billion dollars, and that would have permitted us to have a $25 billion tax reduction.", "In my tax reduction program for middle-income taxpayers, I recommended that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person.", "That would mean, of course, that for a family of four that that family would have a thousand dollars more personal exemption - money that they could spend for their own purposes, money that the government wouldn't have to spend.", "But if we keep the lid on federal spending, which I think we can - with the help of the Congress, we can justify fully a $28 billion tax reduction.", "In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending.", "For the last ten years the budget of the United States has grown from uh - about 11 percent per year.", "We can't afford that kind of growth in federal spending.", "And in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half - a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one-half percent.", "With that kind of limitation, on federal spending, we can fully justify the tax reductions that I have proposed.", "And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that we'll get more revenue and we'll have a more prosperous economy.", " That tax bill does not entirely meet the criteria that I established.", "I think the Congress should have uh - added another $10 billion reduction in personal income taxes, including the increase of personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars.", "And Congress could have done that if the budget committees of the Congress, and the Congress as a whole, had not increased the spending that I recommended in the budget.", "I'm sure that you know that in the resolutions passed by the Congress, that have added about $17 billion in more spending, by the Congress over the budget that I recommended.", "So I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending.", "Now this tax bill - that hasn't reached the White House yet, but is expected in a day or two - it's about fifteen hundred pages.", "It has some good provisions in it.", "It has - uh left out some that I have recommended, unfortunately.", "On the other hand, uh when you have a bill of that magnitude, with - tho- those many provisions, a president has to sit and decide if there's more good than bad.", "And from the a- analysis that I've made so far, it seems to me that that tax bill does uh - justify my signature and my approval.", " Well, Mr. Ford is - is uh changing uh considerably his previous philosophy.", "The present tax structure is a disgrace to this country; it's just a welfare program for the rich.", "As a matter of fact, uh - 25 percent of the total tax deductions, go for only 1 percent of the richest people in this country, and over 50 percent of the tax uh credits go for the 14 percent of the richest people in this country.", "When Mr. Ford first became president in - in August of 1974, the first thing he did in - in October was to ask for a $4.7 billion increase in taxes on our people in the midst of the heaviest recession, since uh - since the great depression of nineteen uh - of the 1940s.", "In uh - January of 1975 he asked for a tax change: a $5.6 billion increase on low-and-middle-income private individuals, a six and a half billion dollar decrease on the corporations and the special interests.", "In uh - December of uh - 1975 he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion dollar uh tax-reduction bill that had been passed by the Congress, and then he came back later on in January of this year and he did advocate a $10 billion tax reduction, but it would be offset by a $6 billion increase this coming January in deductions for Social Security payments and for unemployment compensation.", "The whole philosophy of the Republican party, including uh - my opponent, has been to pile on taxes on low-income people to take 'em off on the corporations.", "As a matter fact, in - sin- since the late sixties when Mr. Nixon took office, we've had a reduction in uh - in the percentage of taxes paid by corporations from 30 percent down to about 20 percent.", "We've had an increase in taxes paid by individuals, payroll taxes, from14 Percent up to 20 percent.", "And this is what the Republicans have done to us.", "And this is why a tax reform is so important.", " Well, as a matter of fact there is.", "If we assume the ah - uh - a rate of growth of our economy, equivalent to what it was during President Johnson, President Kennedy, even before the - the - the - uh wa uh - Vietnese- namese War, and if we assume that at the end of the four-year period we can cut our unemployment rate down to 4 to 4 and a half percent - under those circumstances, even assuming no elimination of unnecessary programs and assuming an increase in the ad- in the allotment of money to finance programs, increasing as the inflation rate does - my economic projections, I think confirmed by the House uh - and the Senate committees, have been with the $60 billion extra amount of money that can be spent in fiscal year '81 which will be the last year of this next term.", "Within that sixty-billion dollars increase there would be fit the programs that I promised the American people.", "I might say too, that - that if we see that these goals cannot be reached - and I believe they're reasonable goals - then I would cut back on the rate of implement- implementation of new programs in order to accommodate a balanced budget by fiscal year '81 which is the last year of the next term.", "I believe that we ought to have a balanced budget during normal economic circumstances.", "And uh - these projections have been very carefully made.", "I stand behind them.", "And if they should be in error slightly on the down side, then I'll phase in the programs that we've uh - advocated, more slowly.", " Well, the uh - the assumption that - that you uh - have described as different is in the rate of growth of our economy.", " I believe that it's accurate to say that - that the - that the committees to whom you refer with the - the employment that you uh - state, and with the 5 to 5 and a half percent growth rate in our economy, that the uh - projections would be a uh - a $60 billion increase in the amount of money that we'd have to spend in l981 compared to now.", "And uh - with that uh - in that framework would befit the - any improvements in the programs.", "Now this does not include uh - any uh - uh extra control over uh unnecessary spending, the weeding out of obsolete or obsolescent programs.", "Uh - we'll have uh - a safety version built in with complete reorganization of the executive branch of government which I am pledged to do.", "The present bureaucratic structure of the - of the Federal Government is a mess.", "And if I'm elected president that's gonna be a top priority of mine to completely revise the structure of the federal government, to make it economical, efficient, purposeful and manageable for a change.", "And also, I'm going to institute zero-based budgeting which I used four years in Georgia, which uh - assesses every program every year, and eliminates those programs that are obsolete or obsolescent.", "But with these projections, we will have a balanced budget by fiscal year 1981, if I'm elected president.", "Keep my promises to the American people.", "And it's just predicated on very modest, but I think accurate, projections of employment increases and uh - a growth in our national economy equal to what was experienced under Kennedy, Johnson, before the Vietnam War.", " If it is uh true that there will be a $60 billion surplus by fiscal year 1981, rather than spend that money for all the new programs that Governor Carter recommends and endorses, and which are included in the Democratic platform, I think the American taxpayer ought to get an additional tax break - a tax reduction of that magnitude.", "I feel that the taxpayers are the ones that need the relief: I don't think we should add additional programs of the magnitude that Governor Carter talks about.", "It seems to me that our tax structure today has rates that are too high.", "But I am uh - very glad to point out that since 1969, during a Republican administrations, we have had ten million people taken off of the tax rolls at the lower end of the taxpayer area.", "And at the same time, assuming that I sign the tax bill that was mentioned by Mr. Gannon, we will in the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers.", "And I believe that by eliminating ten million taxpayers in the last uh eight years, and by putting a heavier tax burden on those in the higher tax brackets, plus the other actions that've been taken uh - we can give taxpayers adequate tax relief.", "Now it seems to me that uh - as we look at the recommendations of the budget committees and our own projections, there isn't going to be any $60 billion dividend.", "I've heard of those dividends in the past; it always happens.", "We expected one at the time of the Vietnam War, but it was used up before we ever ended the war and taxpayers never got the adequate relief they deserved.", " The amnesty program that I recommended in Chicago in September of 1974 would give to all draft evaders and - uh military deserters the opportunity to earn their uh - good record back.", "About fourteen to fifteen thousand did take advantage of that program.", "We gave them ample time.", "I am against- an across-the-board pardon of draft evaders or military deserters.", "Now in the case of Mr. Nixon, the reason the - the pardon was given, was that, when I took office this country was in a very, very divided condition.", "There was hatred, there was divisiveness - uh people had lost faith in their government in many, many respects.", "Mr. Nixon resigned, and I became president.", "It seemed to me that if I was to uh adequately and effectively handle the problems of high inflation, a growing recession, the uh - involvement of the United States still in Vietnam that I had to give a hundred percent of my time to those two major problems.", "Mr. Nixon resigned.", "That is disgrace.", "The first President out of thirty-eight that ever resigned from public office under pressure.", "So when you look at the penalty that he paid, and when you analyze the requirements that I had - to spend all of my time working on the economy, which was in trouble, that I inherited; working on our problems in Southeast Asia - which were still plaguing us - it seemed to me that Mr. Nixon had been penalized enough by his resignation in disgrace and the need, and necessity for me to concentrate on the problems of the country fully justified the action that I took.", " Well, Mr. Carter has uh indicated that uh - he would give a blanket pardon to all uh - draft evaders.", "I do not agree with that point of view.", "I gave, in September of 1974, an opportunity for all draft evaders, all deserters, to come in voluntarily, clear their records by earning an opportunity to restore their good citizenship.", "I think we gave them a good opportunity - we're - I don't think we should go any further.", " Well I think it's uh... very difficult for President Ford to uh - explain the difference between the pardon of President Nixon and - and uh - his attitude toward those who violated the draft laws.", "As a matter of fact - now- I don't advocate amnesty; I advocate pardon.", "There's a difference in my opinion - uh and in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court and accordance with the definition in the dictionary.", "Amnesty means that - that you uh - that what you did was right.", "Pardon means that what you did, whether it's right or wrong, you're forgiven for it.", "And I do advocate a pardon for - for draft evaders.", "I think it's accurate to say that in uh - two years ago when Mr. Nixon - Mr. Ford put in this uh amnesty that three times as many deserters were uh - excused as were - as were the uh - the ones who evaded the draft.", "But I think that now is the time to heal our country after the Vietnam War and I think that what the people are concerned about is not the - uh pardon or the amnesty of uh - those who evaded the draft, but - but whether or not our crime system is - is fair.", "We've got a - a sharp distinction drawn between white collar crime - the - the - the big shots who are rich, who are influential uh very seldom go to jail; those who are poor and - and who have uh no influence - uh quite often are the ones who are punished.", "And - and the whole uh subject of crime is one that concerns our people very much, and I believe that the fairness of it is - is what - uh - is a - is a major problem that addresses our - our leader and this is something that hasn't been addressed adequately by - by this administration.", "But I - I hope to have a complete uh responsibility on my shoulders to help bring about a - a fair uh - criminal justice system and also to - to bring about uh - an end to the - to the divise- divisiveness that has occurred in our country uh as a result of the Vietnam War.", " Well, I've been through this before, Mr. Gannon, as the governor of Georgia.", "When I took aver we had uh a bureaucratic mess, like we have in Washington now, and we had three hundred agencies, departments, bureaus, commissions - uh some uh - fully budgeted, some not, but all having responsibility to carry out that was in conflict.", "And we cut those three hundred - uh agencies and so forth down substantially.", "We eliminated two hundred and seventy-eight of them.", "We set up a simple structure of government that could be administrated fairly and it was a - a tremendous success.", "It hasn't been undone since I was there.", "It resulted also in an ability to reshape our court system, our prison system, our education system, our mental health programs and - and a clear assignment of responsibility and - and authority and also to have uh our people once again understanding control our government.", "I intend to do the same thing if I'm elected president.", "When I get to Washington, coming in as an outsider, one of the major responsibilities that - that I will have on my shoulder is a complete reorganization of the - of the executive branch of government.", "We now have uh - a greatly expanded White House staff.", "When Mr. Nixon went in office, for instance, we had three and a half million dollars spent on - on the White House and its staff.", "That has escalated now to sixteen and a half million dollars, in the last uh Republican administration.", "This needs to be changed.", "We need to put the responsibilities back on the cabinet members.", "We also need to have a great reduction in agencies and programs.", "For instance, we now have uh - in the health area three hundred and two different programs administered by eleven major departments and agencies, sixty other advisory commissions responsible for this.", "Medicaid's in one agency; Medicare is in a different one.", "The - the check on the quality of health care is in a different one.", "None of them uh are responsible for health care itself.", "This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program.", "We have uh - just advocated uh - this past week a consolidation of the responsibilities for energy.", "Our country now has no comprehensive energy program or policy.", "We have twenty different agencies in the federal government responsible for the production, the regulation, the uh - information about energy, the conservation of energy, spread all over government.", "This is a - a gross waste of money, so tough, competent management of government, giving us a simple efficient purposeful and manageable government would be a great step forward and if I'm elected - and I intend to be - then it's gonna be done.", " I can't say for sure that we would have fewer federal employees when I go out of office than when I come in.", "It took me about three years to completely reorganize the Georgia government.", "The last year I was in office uh - our budget was - was actually less than it was a year before, uh which showed a great uh improvement.", "Also, we had a - a 2 percent increase in the number of employees the last year.", "But it was a tremendous shift from administrative jobs into the delivery of services.", "For instance, we uh - completely revised our prison system.", "We established eighty-four new mental health treatment centers.", "And we shifted people out of administrative jobs into the field to deliver better services.", "The same thing will be done uh - at the federal government level.", "I - I accomplished this with s - substantial reductions in employees in some departments.", "For instance, in the Transportation Department uh we had uh - we cut back about 25 percent of the total number of employees.", "In giving our people better mental health care, we increased the number of employees.", "But the efficiency of it, the simplicity of it, the uh ability of people to understand their own government and control it was a - was a uh - substantial benefit derived from complete reorganization.", "We uh - have got to do that at the federal government level.", "If we don't, the bureaucratic mess is going to continue.", "There's no way for our people now to understand what their government is.", "There's no way to get the answer to a question.", "When you come to Washington to try to - as a governor - to try to begin a new program for your people, like uh the treatment of drug addicts, I found there were thirteen different federal agencies that I had to go to, to manage the uh drug treatment program.", "In the Georgia government we only had one agency responsible for drug treatment.", "This is the kind of change that would be made.", "And uh - it would be of - of tremendous benefit in long-range planning, in tight budgeting, uh saving the taxpayers' money, making the government more efficient, cutting down on bureaucratic waste, having a clear delineation of authority and responsibility of employees, and giving our people a better chance to understand and control their government.", " I think the record should show, Mr. Newman, that uh - the Bureau of Census - we checked it just yesterday - indicates that uh - in the four years that uh - Governor Carter was governor of the state of Georgia, uh - expenditures by the government went up over 50 percent Uh - employees of the government in Georgia during his term of office went up over 25 percent; and the figures also show that the uh, uh - bonded indebtedness of the state of Georgia during his governorship went up over 20 percent.", "And there was some very interesting testimony given by Governor Carter's successor, Governor Busby, before a Senate committee a few uh - months ago on how he found the Medicaid program when he came into office following Governor Carter.", "He testified, and these are his words - the present governor of Georgia - he says he found the Medicaid program in Georgia in shambles.", "Now let me talk about what we've done in the White House as far as federal employees are concerned The first order that I issued after I became president was to cut or eliminate the prospective forty-thousand increase in federal employees that had been scheduled by my predecessor.", "And in the term that I've been president - some two years - we have reduced federal employment by eleven thousand.", "In the White House staff itself, when I became president, we had roughly five hundred and forty employees.", "We now have about four hundred and eighty-five employees, so we've made a rather significant reduction in the number of employees on the White House staff working for the president.", "So I think our record of cutting back employees, plus the failure on the part of the Governor's programs to actually save employment in Georgia, shows which is the better plan.", " Well, in the uh - last two years, as I indicated before, we had a very tough time.", "We were faced with uh - heavy inflation, over 12 percent; we were faced with substantial unemployment.", "But in the last uh - twenty-four months we've turned the economy around and we've brought inflation down to under 6 percent, and we have reduced the uh - well, we have added employment of about four million in the last seventeen months to the point where we have eighty-eight million people working in America today - the most in the history of the country.", "The net result is we are going to have some improvement in our receipts.", "And I think we'll have some decrease in our disbursements.", "We expect to have a lower deficit in fiscal year 1978.", "We feel that with this improvement in the economy; we feel with more receipts and fewer disbursements we can in a moderate way increase, as I recommended, over the next ten years a new parks program that would cast a billion and a half dollars, doubling our national park system.", "We have recommended that in the h- housing program we can reduce down payments and moderate monthly payments.", "But that doesn't cost any more as far as the federal treasury is concerned.", "We believe that we can uh do a better job in the area of crime, but that requires a tougher sentencing, mandatory certain prison sentences for those who violate our criminal laws.", "We - uh believe that uh you can revise the federal criminal code, which has not been revised in a good many years.", "That doesn't cost any more money.", "We believe that you can uhh - do something more effectively with a moderate increase in money in the drug abuse program.", "We feel that uh - in education we can have a slight increase - not a major increase.", "It's my understanding that Governor Carter has indicated that uh - he approves of a $30 billion uh - expenditure by the federal government as far as education is concerned.", "At the present time we're spending roughly three billion five hundred million dollars.", "I don't know where that money would come from.", "But as we look at the quality-of-life programs - jobs, health, education, crime, recreation - we feel that as we move forward with a healthier economy, we can absorb the small necessary cost that will be required.", " We feel that uh - with the programs that I have recommended, the additional $10 billion tax cut, with the moderate increases in the quality-of-life area, we can still have a balanced budget which I will submit to the Congress in January of 1978.", "We won't wait one year or two years longer, as Governor Carter uh - indicates.", "As the economy improves, and it is improving, our gross national product this year will average about 6 percent increase over last year.", "We will have the lower rate of inflation for the uh - calendar year this year - something slightly under 6 percent.", "Employment will be up, revenues will be up.", "We'll keep the lid on some of these programs that we can hold down as we have a little extra money to spend for those quality-of-life programs which I think are needed and necessary.", "Now I cannot, and would not, endorse the kind of program that uh - Governor Carter recommends.", "He endorses the Democratic uh - platform which, as I read it, calls for approximately sixty additional programs.", "We estimate that those programs would add a hundred billion dollars minimum and probably two hundred billion dollars - uhh maximum each year to the federal budget.", "Those programs you cannot afford and give tax relief.", "We feel that you can hold the line and restrain federal spending, give a tax reduction and still have a balanced budget by 1978.", " Well, Mr. Ford takes the uh - same attitude that the Republicans always take.", "In the last three months before an election, they're always for the programs that they always fight the other three-and-one-half years.", "Uh - I remember when uh - Herbert Hoover was against uh - jobs for people.", "I remember when Alf Landon was against Social Security and uh - later President Nixon, sixteen years ago, was telling the public that John Kennedy's proposals would bankrupt the country and would double the cost.", "The best thing to do is to look at the record uh - of Mr. Ford's Administration and Mr. Nixon's before his.", "Uh - we had last year a $65 billion deficit - the largest deficit in the history of our country - more of a deficit spending than we had in the entire eight-year period under President Johnson and President Kennedy.", "We've got five hundred thousand more Americans out of jobs today than were out of work three months ago and since Mr. Ford's been in office two years, we've had a 50 percent increase in unemployment from five million people out of work to two and a half million more people out of work and a total of seven and a half million.", "We've also got uh - a comparison between himself and Mr. Nixon.", "He's got four times the size of the deficits that Mr. Nixon even had himself.", "This uh - talking about more people at work - uh is distorted because with a 14 percent increase in the cost of living in the last uh - two years, it means that - that women and young people have had to go to work when they didn't want to because their fathers didn't make enough to pay the increased cost of uh - food and uh housing and clothing.", "We have uh - in this last uh two years alone a hundred and twenty billion dollars total deficits under President Ford and uh - at the same time we've had, in the last eight years, a doubling in the number of bankruptcies for small business: we've had a negative growth in our - in our national economy measured in real dollars.", "The take-home pay of a worker in this country is actually less now than it was in 1968 - measured in real dollars.", "This is the kind of record that's there and talk about the future and a drastic change or conversion on the part of Mr. Ford as of last minute is one that just doesn't go.", " Well among my other experiences in the past, I've - I've been a nuclear engineer, and did graduate work in this field.", "I think I know the - the uh capabilities and limitations of atomic power.", "But the energy - uh policy of our nation is one that uh has not yet been established under this administration.", "I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy except us.", "We have seen uh - the Federal Energy Agency established, for instance.", "Uh - in the crisis of 1973 it was supposed to be a temporary agency, uh now it's permanent, it's enormous, it's growing every day.", "I think the Wall Street Journal uh reported not too long ago they have a hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people its own existence.", "We've got to have a - a firm way to handle the energy question.", "The reorganization proposal that I have put forward is one uh first step.", "In addition to that, we need to have - uh a realization that we've got uh about thirty-five years worth of oil left in the whole world.", "We're gonna run out of oil.", "When Mr. Nixon made his famous uh speech on Operation Independence we were importing about 35 percent of our oil.", "Now we've increased that amount 25 percent.", "We now import about 44 percent of our oil.", "We need to shift from oil to coal.", "We need to concentrate our research and development effort on uh coal burning and extraction, with safer mines, but also it's clean burning.", "We need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures.", "And then as a last resort only, continue to use atomic power.", "I would certainly uh - not cut out atomic power altogether.", "We can't afford to give up that opportunity until later.", "But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained.", "For instance, some that have been forgotten; we need to have the reactor core - below ground level, the entire power plant that uses atomic uh - power tightly sealed and a heavy - heavy vacuum maintained.", "There ought to be a standardized design.", "There ought to be a full-time uh - atomic energy specialist, independent of the power company in the control room, full time, twenty-four hours a day, to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops.", "These kinds of uh - procedures, along with evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated.", "So, shift from oil to coal, emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power, strict conservation measures, not yield every time that the special interest groups uh - put pressure on the president like uh this administration has done, and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strictest possible safety precautions.", "That's the best overall energy policy in the brief time we have to discuss it.", " Yes, I would.", "Some of the things that can be done about this is a change in the rate structure of electric power companies.", "We uh - now encourage people to waste electricity, and uh - by giving uh - the lowest rates to the biggest users.", "We don't do anything to cut down on peak load requirements.", "We don't have an adequate requirement for the insulation of homes, for the efficiency of automobiles.", "And whenever the uh - automobile manufacturers come forward and say they can't meet the uh - amendments that the Congress has put forward, this Republican administration has delayed the implementation dates.", "In addition to that, we ought to have a - a shift toward the use of coal, particularly in the Appalachian regions where the coal is located.", "A lot of uh - very high quality, low-carbon coal, uh - low-sulfur coal is there, it's where our employment is needed.", "Uh - this would - would help a great deal.", "So mandatory conservation measures - yes.", "Encouragement by the president for people to uh voluntarily conserve - yes.", "And also the private sector ought to be encouraged to - to bring forward to the public the benefits from efficiency.", "One bank in uh - Washington, fo- for instance, gives lower interest loans for people who adequately insulate their homes or who buy efficient automobiles.", "And some major uh - uh - manufacturing companies, like Dow Chemical, have through uh - very effective efficiency mechanism cut down the use of energy by uh - as much as 40 percent with the same out-product.", "These kinds of things uh - ought to be done, uh they ought to be encouraged and supported, and even required uh by the government, yes.", " Governor Carter skims over a very serious and a very broad subject.", "In January of uh - 1975 I submitted to the Congress and to the American people the first comprehensive energy program recommended by any president.", "It called for an increase in the production of energy in the United States.", "It called for uh - conservation measures so that we would save the energy that we have.", "If you're going to increase domestic oil and gas production - and we have to - you have to give those producers an opportunity to uh - develop their land or their wells.", "I recommended to the Congress that we should increase production in this country from six hundred million tons a year to twel- a- a billion two hundred million tons by 1985.", "In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground; we have to improve our utilization of coal - make it more efficient, make it cleaner.", "In addition we uh - have to expand our research and development.", "In my program for energy independence we have increased, for example, solar energy research from about $84 million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year.", "We're going as fast as the experts say we should.", "In nuclear power we have increased the research and development, uh - under the Energy Research and Development Agency uh - very substantially, to insure that our ener- uh - nuclear power plants are safer, that they are more efficient, and that we have adequate safeguards.", "I think you have to have greater oil and gas production, more coal production, more nuclear production, and in addition you have to have energy conservation.", " The bills that I vetoed, the one for an additional $6 billion, was not a bill that would have solved our unemployment problems.", "Even the proponents of it admitted that no more than four hundred thousand jobs would be uh - made available.", "Our analysis indicates that something in the magnitude of about one hundred fifty to two hundred thousand jobs would uh - be made available.", "Each one of those jobs would've cost the taxpayers $25 thousand.", "In addition, the jobs would not be available right now.", "They would not have materialized for about nine to eighteen months.", "The immediate problem we have is to stimulate our economy now so that we can get rid of unemployment.", "What we have done is to hold the lid on spending in an effort to reduce the rate of inflation.", "And we have proven, I think very conclusively, that you can reduce the rate of inflation and increase jobs.", "For example, as I have said, we have added some four million jobs in the last seventeen months.", "We have now employed eighty-eight million people in America, the largest number in the history of the United States.", "We've added five hundred thousand jobs in the last two months.", "Inflation is the quickest way to destroy jobs.", "And by holding the lid on federal spending we have been able to do an- a good job, an affirmative job in inflation and as a result have added to the jobs in this country.", "I think it's uh - also appropriate to point out that through our tax policies we have stimulated uhh - added employment throughout the country, the investment tax credit, the tax incentives for expansion and modernization of our industrial capacity.", "It's my - my opinion that the private sector, where five out of six jobs are, where you have permanent jobs, with the opportunity for advancement, is a better place than make-work jobs under the program recommended by the Congress.", " Well, that bill has not yet come down to the Oval Office, so I am not in a position to make any judgment on it tonight.", "But that is an extra $4 billion that would uh - add to the deficit which would add to the inflationary pressures, which would help to destroy jobs in the private sector - not make jobs, where the jobs really are.", "These make-work, temporary jobs - dead end as they are - are not the kind of jobs that we want for our people.", "I think it's interesting to point out that uh - in the uh - two years that I've been president I've vetoed fifty-six bills.", "Congress has sustained forty-two vetoes.", "As a result, we have saved over $9 billion in federal expenditures.", "And the Congress by overriding the bills that I did veto, the Congress has added some $13 billion to the federal expenditures and to the federal deficit.", "Now Governor Carter complains about the deficits that uh - uh - this administration has had.", "And yet he condemns the vetoes that I have made that has - that have saved the taxpayer $9 billion and could have saved an additional $13 billion.", "Now he can't have it both ways.", "And therefore, it seems to me that we should hold the lid, as we have, to the best of our ability so we can stimulate the private economy and get the jobs where the jobs are - five out of six in this economy.", " Well, Mr. Ford doesn't seem to put into perspective the fact that when - when uh five hundred thousand more people are out of work than there were three months ago, while we have two and a half million more people out of work than were when he took office, that this touches human beings.", "I was in uh - a city in uh - Pennsylvania not too long ago, near here, and uh - there were about four or five thousand people in the audience - it was on a - on a train trip.", "And I said, \"How many uh - adults here are out of work?\"", "About a thousand raised their hands.", "Mr. Ford uh - actually has fewer people now in the private sector in non-farm jobs than when he took office.", "And still he talks about - uh success.", "Seven point nine percent unemployment is a terrible tragedy in this country.", "He says he's learned how to match unemployment with inflation.", "That's right.", "We've got the highest inflation we've had in twenty-five years right now, except under this administration, and that was fifty years ago.", "And we've got uh - the highest unemployment we've had uh - under Mr. Ford's administration, since the Great Depression.", "This affects human beings, and - and his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration, and not a work administration.", "He hasn't saved $9 billion with his vetoes.", "There's only been uh - a net savings of $4 billion.", "And the cost in unemployment compensation, welfare compensation, and lost revenues has increased $23 billion in the last two years.", "This is a - a typical attitude that really causes havoc in people's lives, and then it's covered over by saying that our country has naturally got a 6 percent unemployment rate, or 7 percent unemployment rate and a 6 percent inflation.", "It's a travesty.", "It shows a lack of leadership.", "And we've never had a president since the War between the States that vetoed more bills.", "Mr. Ford has vetoed four times as many bills as Mr. Nixon - per year.", "And eleven of 'em have been overridden.", "One of his bills that was overridden - he only got one vote in the Senate and seven votes in the House, from Republicans.", " Right.", " Now we have uh such a grossly unbalanced tax system - as I said earlier, that it is a disgrace - ah of all the tax - benefits now, 25 percent of 'em go to the 1 percent of the richest people in this country.", "Over 50 percent - 53 to be exact - percent of the tax benefits go to the 14 percent richest people in this country, and we've had a 50 percent increase in payroll deductions since Mr. Nixon went in office eight years ago.", "Mr. Ford has - has advocated since he's been in office over $5 billion in reductions for corporations, special interest groups, and the very, very wealthy who derive their income - not from labor - but from investments.", "That's got to be changed.", "A few things that can be done: we have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporations who invest overseas - if they make a million dollars in profits overseas - they don't have to pay any of their taxes unless they bring their money back into this country.", "When they don't pay their taxes, the average American pays the taxes for them.", "Not only that, but it robs this country of jobs, because instead of coming back with that million dollars and creating a shoe factory, say in New Hampshire or Vermont, if the company takes the money down to Italy and - and builds a shoe factory, they don't have to pay any taxes on the money.", "Another thing is a system called DISC which was originally designed, proposed by Mr. Nixon, to encourage exports.", "This permits a company to create uh - a dummy corporation, to export their products, and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them.", "This costs our uh - government about uh - $1.4 billion a year.", "And when those rich corporations don't pay that tax, the average American taxpayer pays it for 'em.", "Another one that's uh - that's very important is the uh - is the business deductions, uh - jet airplanes, uh - first class travel, the fifty-dollar martini lunch.", "The average working person can't - uh - can't take advantage of that, but the - the wealthier people - uh can.", "Uh - another system is where uhh - a dentist can invest money in say, raising cattle and uh - can put in a hundred thousand dollars of his own money, borrow nine hundred thousand dollars - nine hundred mi- thousand dollars - that makes a million - and mark off a great amount of uh - of loss uh - through that procedure.", "Uh - there was one example, for instance, where uh - somebody uh - produced pornographic movies.", "They put in $30 thousand of their own money and got a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in tax savings.", "Well, these special kinds of programs have - have robbed the average taxpayer and have benefited those who are powerful, and who can employ lobbyists, and who can have their CPAs and their lawyers to help them benefit from the roughly uh - eight thousand pages of the tax code.", "The average uh American person can't do it.", "You can't hire a lobbyist uh out of unemployment compensation checks.", " Yes.", "You need about, according to Congressional committees on this, you need about $10 billion.", "Now you listed some things - the uh - deferral on foreign income as estimated: that would save about $500 million.", "DISC, you said, was about 1.4 billion.", "uh - The estimate of the outside, if you eliminated all tax shelters, is 5 billion.", "So where else would you raise the revenue to provide this tax relief - would you, in fact, do away with all business deductions, and what other kinds of preferences would you do away with?", " No, I wouldn't do away with all - uh business deductions.", "I think that would be a - a very serious mistake.", "But uh - if - if you could just do away with the ones that are unfair, you could lower taxes for everyone.", "I would never do anything that would increase the taxes for those who work for a living, or who are presently required to list all their income.", "What I wanna do is not to raise taxes, but to eliminate loopholes.", "And this is uh - the point of my first statistics that I gave you - that - that the present tax benefits that have been carved out over a long period of years - fifty years - by sharp tax lawyers and by lobbyists have benefited just the rich.", "These programs that I described to you earlier - the tax deferrals for overseas, the DISC, and the tax shelters, uh - they only apply to people in the $50 thousand-a-year bracket or up, and I think this is the very best way to approach it.", "It's to make sure that everybody pays taxes on the income that they earn and make sure that you take whatever savings there is from the higher income levels and give it to the lower- and middle-income families.", " Governor Carter's answer tonight does not coincide with the answer that he gave in an interview to the Associated Press a week or so ago.", "In that interview uh - Governor Carter indicated that uh - he would raise the taxes on those in the medium or middle-income brackets or higher.", "Now if you uh - take the medium or middle-income taxpayer - that's about $14 thousand per person - uh - Governor Carter has indicated, publicly, in an interview that he would increase the taxes on about 50 percent of the working people of this country.", "I think uh - the way to get tax equity in this country is to give tax relief to the middle-income people who have an income from roughly $8 thousand up to twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars.", "They have been short-changed as we have taken ten million taxpayers off the tax rolls in the last eight years, and as we have uh - added to the minimum tax uh - provision to make all people pay more taxes.", "I believe in tax equity for the middle-income taxpayer, increasing the personal exemption.", "Mr. Carter wants to increase taxes for roughly half of the taxpayers of this country.", "Now, the Governor has also played a little fast and loose with the facts about vetoes.", "The records show that President Roosevelt vetoed an average of fifty-five bills a year.", "President Truman vetoed on the average, while he was president, about thirty-eight bills a year.", "I understand that Governor Carter, when he was Governor of Georgia, vetoed between thirty-five and forty bills a year.", "My average in two years is twenty-six.", "But in the process of that we have saved uhh - $9 billion.", "And one final comment, uh - Governor Carter talks about the tax bills and all of the inequities that exist in the present law.", "I must remind him the Democrats have controlled the Congress for the last twenty-two years and they wrote all the tax bills.", " There is a considerable anti-Washington feeling throughout the country.", "But I think the feeling is misplaced.", "In the last two years, we have restored integrity in the White House, and we've set high standards in the executive branch of the government.", "The anti-Washington feeling, in my opinion, ought to be focused on the Congress of the United States.", "For example, this Congress, very shortly, will spend a billion dollars a year for its housekeeping, its salaries, its expenses and the like.", "It - the next Congress will probably be the first billion-dollar Congress in the history of the United States.", "I don't think the American people are getting their money's worth from the majority party that run this Congress.", "We, in addition, see that uh - in the last uh - four years the number of employees hired by the Congress has gone up substantial- uh much more than uh - the gross national product, much more than any other increase throughout our society.", "Congress is hiring people by the droves, and the cast as a result has gone up.", "And I don't see any improvement in the performance of the Congress under the present leadership.", "So it seems to me instead of the anti-Washington feeling being aimed at everybody in Washington, it seems to me that the focus should be where the problem is, which is the Congress of the United States, and particularly the majority in the Congress.", "They spend too much money on themselves.", "They have too many employees.", "There's some question about their morality.", "It seems to me that in this election, the focus should not be on the executive branch but the corrections should come as the voters vote for their members of the House of Representatives or for their United States senator.", "That's where the problem is and I hope there'll be some corrective action taken so we can get some new leadership in the Congress of the United States.", " Well, It seems to me that uh - we have a chance - the Republicans - to get a majority in the House of Representatives.", "We will make some gains in the United States Senate.", "So there will be different ratios in the House, as well as in the Senate, and as president I will be able to uh - work with that Congress.", "But let me take the other side of the coin, if I might.", "Supposing we had - had a Democratic Congress for the last two years and we'd had uh - Governor Carter as President.", "He has, in effect, said that he would agree with all of - he would disapprove of the vetoes that I have made, and would have added significantly to expenditures and the deficit in the federal government.", "I think it would be contrary to one of the basic concepts in our system of government - a system of checks and balances.", "We have a Democratic Congress today, and fortunately we've had a Republican president to check their excesses with my vetoes.", "If we have a Democratic Congress next year, and a president who wants to spend an additional one hundred billion dollars a year, or maybe two hundred billion dollars a year, with more programs, we will have in my judgment, greater deficits with more spending, more dangers of inflation.", "I think the American people want a Republican president to check on any excesses that come out of the next Congress, if it is a Democratic Congress.", " Well, it's not a matter of uh - Republican and Democrat.", "It's a matter of leadership or no leadership.", "President Eisenhower worked with a Democratic Congress very well.", "Even President Nixon, because he was a strong leader at least, worked with a Democratic Congress very well.", "Uh - Mr. Ford has vetoed, as I said earlier, four times as many bills per year as Mr. Nixon.", "Mr. Ford quite often puts forward a program just as a public relations stunt, and never tries to put it through the Congress by working with the Congress.", "I think under presidents For- uh - Nixon and Eisenhower they passed about 60 to 75 percent of their legislation.", "This year Mr. Ford will not pass more than 26 percent of all the legislative proposals he puts forward.", "This is government by stalemate, and we've seen almost a complete breakdown in the proper relationship between the president, who represents this country, and the Congress, who collectively also represent this country.", "We've had uh - Republican presidents before who've tried to run against a Democratic - uh Congress.", "And I don't think it's uh - the Congress is Mr. Ford's opponent; but if uh - if - if he insists that uh - that I be responsible for the Democratic Congress, of which I'm - have not been a part, then I think it's only fair that he be responsible for the Nixon administration in its entirety, of which he was a part.", "That, I think, is a good balance.", "But the point is, that - that a president ought to lead this country.", "Mr. Ford, so far as I know, except for avoiding another Watergate, has not accomplished one single major program for this country.", "And there's been a constant squabbling between the president and the Congress, and that's not the way this country ought to be run.", "I might go back to one other thing.", "Mr. Ford has uh - misquoted an AP uh - news story that was in error to begin with.", "That story reported several times that I would lower taxes for low and middle-income families and uh - that correction was delivered to the White House and I am sure that the president knows about this uh - correction, but he still insists uh - on repeating an erroneous statement.", " What I have said is that the president ought to have a chance to appoint a chairman of the Federal Reserve Board to have a coterminous uh term; in other words, both of 'em serve the same four - four years.", "The Congress can modify the supply of money by modifying the income uh tax laws.", "The president can modify the uh - economic structure of a country by public statements and general attitudes in the budget that he proposes.", "The Federal Reserve has uh - an independent status that ought to be preserved; I think that Mr. uh - Burns did take a typical, erroneous Republican attitude in the 1973 year when inflation was so high.", "They assumed that the uh - inflation rate was because of excessive demand and uh - therefore put into effect tight constraint on the economy, very high interest rates, which is typical also of the Republican administration, uh - tried to increase the uh - the tax uh - payments by individuals, and cut the tax payments by corporations.", "I would have uh - done it opposite.", "I think the uh - problem should've been addressed by increasing productivity, by having uh - put - put people back to work so they could purchase more goods, lower income taxes on individuals, perhaps raise them, if necessary, on corporations in comparison.", "But uh - Mr. Burns uh - in that respect made a very serious mistake.", "I would not wanna destroy the - the independence of the uh Federal Reserve - uh Board.", "But I do think we ought to have a cohesive economic policy with at - at least the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and the president's terms being uh - the same and letting the Congress, of course, be the third uh - entity with uh - with independence subject only to the president's veto.", " The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board should be independent.", "Fortunately, he has been during Democratic as well as Republican administrations.", "As the result in the last uh - two years uh - we have had a responsible monetary policy.", "Uh the Federal Reserve Board indicated that the supply of money would be held between four to four and a half and seven and seven and a half.", "They have done a good job in integrating the money supply with the uh - fiscal policy of the uh - executive and legislative branches of the government.", "It would be catastrophic if the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board became the tool of the political uh - party that was in power.", "It's important for our future uhh - economic security that that job be nonpolitical and uh - separate from the executive and the Legislative branches.", " You are familiar, of course, with the fact that I am the first president in thirty years who has reorganized the intelligence agencies in the federal government: the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the others.", "We've done that by executive order.", "Uhh - and I think uh - we've tightened it up; we've uh - straightened out their problems that developed over the last few years.", "It doesn't seem to me that it's needed or necessary to have legislation in this particular regard.", "Uhh - I have recommended to the Congress, however - I'm sure you're familiar with this - legislation that would uhh - make it uhh - very uhh - proper in - in the right way, that the attorney general could go in and get the right for wiretapping under security cases.", "This was an effort that was made by the attorney general and myself, working with the Congress.", "But even in this area, where I think new legislation would be justified, uh the Congress has not responded.", "So, I feel in that case, as well as in the reorganization of the intelligence agencies, as I've done, we have to do it by executive order.", "And I'm glad that we have a good director in George Bush.", "We have good executive orders, and the CIA and the DIA and NASA uh - uh - NSA are now doing a good job under proper supervision.", " Well, one of the very serious things that's happened in our government in recent years, and has continued up until now, is a breakdown in the trust among our people in the [twenty-seven-minute delay]", " There has been too much government secrecy and not uh - not enough respect for the personal privacy of American citizens.", " Well, tonight we've had a chance to talk a lot about the past.", "But I think it's time to talk about the future.", "Our nation in the last eight years has been divided as never before.", "It's a time for unity.", "It's a time to draw ourselves together: to have a president and a Congress that can work together with mutual respect for a change, cooperating for a change, in the open for a change, so the people can understand their own government.", "It's time for government, industry, labor, manufacturing, agriculture, education, other entities in our society to cooperate.", "And it's a time for government to understand and to cooperate with our people.", "For a long time our American citizens have been excluded, sometimes misled, sometimes have been lied to.", "This is uh - not compatible with the purpose of our nation.", "I believe in our country.", "It needs to be competent.", "The government needs to be well-managed, efficient, economical, We need to have a government that's sensitive to our people's needs - to those who are poor, who don't have adequate health care, who have been cheated too long with our tax programs, who've been out of jobs, whose families have been torn apart.", "We need to restore the faith and the trust of the American people in their own government.", "In addition to that, we've suffered because we haven't had leadership in this administration.", "We've got a government of stalemate.", "We've lost the vision of what our country can and ought to be.", "This is not the America that we've known in the past.", "It's not the America that we have to have in the future.", "I don't claim to know all the answers.", "But I've got confidence in my country.", "Our economic strength is still there.", "Our system of government - in spite of Vietnam, Cambodia, CIA, Watergate - is still the best system of government on earth.", "And the greatest resource of all are the two hundred and fifteen million Americans who have within us the strength, the character, the intelligence, the experience, the patriotism, the idealism, the compassion, the sense of brotherhood on which we can rely in the future to restore the greatness to our country We ought not to be excluded from our government anymore.", "We need a president who can go in - who derives his strength from the people.", "I owe the special interests nothing.", "I owe everything to you, the people of this country.", "And I believe that we can bind our wounds.", "I believe that we can work together.", "And I believe that if we can tap the tremendous untapped reservoir of innate strength in this country, that we can once again have a government as good as our people, and let the world know what we still know and hope for - that we still live in the greatest and the strongest and the best country on earth.", " On November second all of you will make a very, very important decision.", "One of the major issues in this campaign is trust.", "A president should never promise more than he can deliver and a president should always deliver everything that he's promised.", "A president can't be all things to all people.", "A president should be the same thing to all people.", "Another issue in this campaign, Governor Carter has endorsed the Democratic platform, which calls for more spending, bigger deficits, more inflation or mare taxes.", "Governor Carter has embraced the record of the present Congress, dominated by his political party.", "It calls for more of the same.", "Governor Carter in his acceptance speech called for more and more programs, which means more and more government.", "I think the real issue in this campaign, and that which you must decide on November second, is whether you should vote for his promise or my performance in two years in the White House.", "On the fourth of July we had a wonderful two hundredth birthday - for our great country.", "It was a superb occasion.", "It was a glorious day.", "In the first century of our nation's history our forefathers gave us the finest form of government in the history of mankind.", "In the second century of our nation's history, our forefathers developed the most productive industrial nation in the history of the globe.", "Our third century should be the century of individual freedom for all our two hundred and fifteen million Americans today and all that join us.", "In the last few years government has gotten bigger and bigger; industry has gotten larger and larger; labor unions have gotten bigger and bigger; and our children have been the victims of mass education.", "We must make this next century the century of the individual.", "We should never forget that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have.", "The individual worker in the plants throughout the United States should not be a small cog in a big machine.", "The member of a labor union must have his rights strengthened and broadened and our children in their education should have an opportunity to improve themselves based on their talents and their abilities.", "My mother and father, during the Depression, worked very hard to give me an opportunity to do better in our great country.", "Your mothers and fathers did the same thing for you and others.", "Betty and I have worked very hard to give our children a brighter future in the United States, our beloved country.", "You and others in this great country have worked hard and done a great deal to give your children and your grandchildren the blessings of a better America.", "I believe we can all work together to make the individuals in the future have more and all of us working together can build a better America.", " Well, thank you.", "Are you a teacher?", "Yes, I think that that\u2019s a very good question, because I\u2019ve heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.", " Well, I actually agree with that.", "I agree with everything she said.", "I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country.", "This is a great country.", "This is a great land.", "I\u2019ve gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I\u2019ve been doing this as a politician.", "I cannot believe I\u2019m saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.", " And my whole concept was to make America great again.", "When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what\u2019s happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it\u2019s a one-sided transaction where we\u2019re giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we\u2019ve made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.", " No, I didn\u2019t say that at all.", "I don\u2019t think you understood what was \u2014 this was locker room talk.", "I\u2019m not proud of it.", "I apologize to my family.", "I apologize to the American people.", "Certainly I\u2019m not proud of it.", "But this is locker room talk.", " And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.", " I have great respect for women.", "Nobody has more respect for women than I do.", " I\u2019ve said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said.", "And I was embarrassed by it.", "But I have tremendous respect for women.", " And women have respect for me.", "And I will tell you: No, I have not.", "And I will tell you that I\u2019m going to make our country safe.", "We\u2019re going to have borders in our country, which we don\u2019t have now.", "People are pouring into our country, and they\u2019re coming in from the Middle East and other places.", " Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they\u2019re taking our wealth.", " And that\u2019s what I want to talk about.", " Well, like everyone else, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw.", "You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.", " These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love.", "And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I\u2019m so fortunate enough to become your president.", " Am I allowed to respond to that?", "I assume I am.", " It\u2019s just words, folks.", "It\u2019s just words.", "Those words, I\u2019ve been hearing them for many years.", "I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.", " So, she\u2019s allowed to do that, but I\u2019m not allowed to respond?", " Sounds fair.", " It was locker room talk, as I told you.", "That was locker room talk.", "I\u2019m not proud of it.", "I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country.", "And certainly, I\u2019m not proud of it.", "But that was something that happened.", " Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he\u2019s just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.", "He gets to decide what he wants to talk about.", "Instead of answering people\u2019s questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that\u2019s his choice.", " He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq.", "And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.", " Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal \u2014 he\u2019s another real winner that you have \u2014 and he\u2019s the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that.", "So you really owe him an apology.", "You\u2019re the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb.", "That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.", " ... because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I\u2019m not surprised.", " Oh, really?", " In the first debate...", " ...", "I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time.", "I\u2019d never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we\u2019re going to really make lives better for people.", " Because you\u2019d be in jail.", " And yet she didn\u2019t know the word \u2014 the letter C on a document.", "Right?", "She didn\u2019t even know what that word \u2014 what that letter meant.", " You did that.", "Wait a minute.", "One second.", " If you did that in the private sector, you\u2019d be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.", " Look, it\u2019s just not true.", "And so please, go to...", " Oh, you didn\u2019t delete them?", " It was personal e-mails, not official.", " Oh, 33,000?", "Yeah.", " Not \u2014 well, we turned over 35,000, so...", " Oh, yeah.", "What about the other 15,000?", " Yes, that\u2019s true, I didn\u2019t.", " Because you have nothing to say.", " I didn\u2019t in the first debate, and I\u2019m going to try not to in this debate, because I\u2019d like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.", " Get off this question.", " OK, Donald.", "I know you\u2019re into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it\u2019s exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you.", "But let\u2019s at least focus...", " Let\u2019s see what happens...", " ... on some of the issues that people care about tonight.", "Let\u2019s get to their questions.", " I\u2019d like to know, Anderson, why aren\u2019t you bringing up the e-mails?", "I\u2019d like to know.", "Why aren\u2019t you bringing...", " No, it hasn\u2019t.", "It hasn\u2019t.", "And it hasn\u2019t been finished at all.", " It\u2019s nice to \u2014 one on three.", " If he wants to start, he can start.", "No, go ahead, Donald.", " No, I\u2019m a gentlemen, Hillary.", "Go ahead.", " Well, I think Donald was about to say he\u2019s going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.", "And I\u2019m going to fix it, because I agree with you.", "Premiums have gotten too high.", "Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I\u2019ve laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.", " So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.", " It is such a great question and it\u2019s maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense.", "Obamacare is a disaster.", "You know it.", "We all know it.", "It\u2019s going up at numbers that nobody\u2019s ever seen worldwide.", "Nobody\u2019s ever seen numbers like this for health care.", " It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.", " No, I mean, he clarified what he meant.", "And it\u2019s very clear.", "Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system.", "But we have an employer-based system.", "That\u2019s where the vast majority of people get their health care.", " ... get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019ve got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma...", " ... you may not be able to have insurance because you can\u2019t afford it.", "So let\u2019s fix what\u2019s broken about it, but let\u2019s not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies.", "That\u2019s not going to work.", " By the way...", " We\u2019re going to be able to.", "You\u2019re going to have plans...", " Well, I\u2019ll tell you what it means.", "You\u2019re going to have plans that are so good, because we\u2019re going to have so much competition in the insurance industry.", "Once we break out \u2014 once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come...", " President Obama \u2014 Anderson, excuse me.", "President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud.", "You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said \u2014 he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie.", "President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan.", "The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn\u2019t work.", " ... so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.", " Well, you\u2019re right about Islamophobia, and that\u2019s a shame.", "But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that \u2014 because there is a problem.", "I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem.", "And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on.", "When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.", "As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people.", "Horribly wounded.", "They\u2019ll never be the same.", "Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.", " Well, thank you for asking your question.", "And I\u2019ve heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there\u2019s been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims.", "And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.", " My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you\u2019re willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community.", "That\u2019s what America is.", "That\u2019s what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.", " First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq.", "Iraq was disaster.", "So he would have been alive today.", " Why don\u2019t you interrupt her?", "You interrupt me all the time.", " Why don\u2019t you interrupt her?", " It\u2019s called extreme vetting.", "We are going to areas like Syria where they\u2019re coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama.", "And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama.", "People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more.", "This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.", " Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us.", "But there are a lot of refugees, women and children \u2014 think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he\u2019d been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.", " That\u2019s not been debunked.", " So, please...", " That has not been debunked.", " ... go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.", " I was against \u2014 I was against the war in Iraq.", "Has not been debunked.", "And you voted for it.", "And you shouldn\u2019t have.", "Well, I just want to say...", " Excuse me.", "She just went about 25 seconds over her time.", " Could I just respond to this, please?", " Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens.", "When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don\u2019t want them.", "In some cases, they\u2019re murderers, drug lords, drug problems.", "And they don\u2019t want them.", " Well, right.", "As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called \u201cLincoln.\u201d It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment.", "It was principled, and it was strategic.", " Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don\u2019t know the reasons.", "But we deserve answers.", "And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has...", " ... with the Russians and other foreign powers.", " Well, I think I should respond, because \u2014 so ridiculous.", "Look, now she\u2019s blaming \u2014 she got caught in a total lie.", "Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things \u2014 WikiLeaks that just came out.", "And she lied.", "Now she\u2019s blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln.", "That\u2019s one that I haven\u2019t...", " Well, one thing I\u2019d do is get rid of carried interest.", "One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code.", "And she could have done this years ago, by the way.", "She\u2019s a United States \u2014 she was a United States senator.", " Well, everything you\u2019ve heard just now from Donald is not true.", "I\u2019m sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality.", "And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn\u2019t paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he\u2019s going to do.", " And we\u2019re going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country.", " Of course I do.", "Of course I do.", "And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors.", "I know many of her donors.", "Her donors took massive tax write-offs.", " A lot of my \u2014 excuse me, Anderson \u2014 a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed.", "And she\u2019ll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it.", "That\u2019s why.", " No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too.", "But I have a write-off, a lot of it\u2019s depreciation, which is a wonderful charge.", "I love depreciation.", "You know, she\u2019s given it to us.", " And, again, Bernie Sanders, it\u2019s really bad judgment.", "She has made bad judgment not only on taxes.", "She\u2019s made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq.", "I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they\u2019ve left, that\u2019s why ISIS formed in the first place.", "They started from that little area, and now they\u2019re in 32 different nations, Hillary.", "Congratulations.", "Great job.", " Well, here we go again.", "I\u2019ve been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York.", "But that\u2019s not the point here.", " Why didn\u2019t you do it?", "Why didn\u2019t you do it?", " Because I was a senator with a Republican president.", " Oh, really?", " I will be the president and we will get it done.", "That\u2019s exactly right.", " You could have done it, if you were an effective \u2014 if you were an effective senator, you could have done it.", "If you were an effective senator, you could have done it.", "But you were not an effective senator.", " You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power.", "Look, he has now said repeatedly, \u201c30 years this and 30 years that.\u201d So let me talk about my 30 years in public service.", "I\u2019m very glad to do so.", "I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.", "And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.", " I\u2019ve proven that I can, and for 30 years, I\u2019ve produced results for people.", " She said a lot of things that were false.", "I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe...", " Excuse me.", "Because she has been a disaster as a senator.", "A disaster.", " Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic.", "And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left.", "And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.", " First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which...", " No, I wasn\u2019t.", "I was gone.", "I hate to interrupt you, but at some point...", " OK.", "But you were in contact \u2014 excuse me.", "You were...", " At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.", " You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you.", "I don\u2019t think he would be listening to you very much anymore.", " And one thing I have to say.", " I don\u2019t like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS.", "Russia is killing ISIS.", "And Iran is killing ISIS.", "And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.", " OK.", "He and I haven\u2019t spoken, and I disagree.", "I disagree.", " I think you have to knock out ISIS.", "Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS.", "We have people that want to fight both at the same time.", "But Syria is no longer Syria.", "Syria is Russia and it\u2019s Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.", " I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.", " I think that it basically has fallen.", "OK?", "It basically has fallen.", "Let me tell you something.", "You take a look at Mosul.", "The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul.", "They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul.", "So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.", "Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul.", "Why can\u2019t they do it quietly?", "Why can\u2019t they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we\u2019ve knocked out the leaders, we\u2019ve had a tremendous success?", "People leave.", "Why do they have to say we\u2019re going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they\u2019re saying?", "How stupid is our country?", " There are sometimes reasons the military does that.", "Psychological warfare.", " I can\u2019t think of any.", "I can\u2019t think of any.", "And I\u2019m pretty good at it.", " And we have General Flynn.", "And we have \u2014 look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me.", "I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me.", "We talk about it all the time.", "They understand, why can\u2019t they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership?", "How \u2014 why would these people stay there?", "I\u2019ve been reading now...", " ... for weeks \u2014 I\u2019ve been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it\u2019s the harbor of where \u2014 you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are.", "Why would they be saying \u2014 they\u2019re not staying there anymore.", "They\u2019re gone.", "Because everybody\u2019s talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.", " I would not use American ground forces in Syria.", "I think that would be a very serious mistake.", "I don\u2019t think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force.", "I don\u2019t think that is a smart strategy.", " Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I \u2014 if I\u2019m fortunate...", " Everything.", " I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq.", "I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul.", "And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals.", "No, he doesn\u2019t.", "I would go after Baghdadi.", "I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders \u2014 and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones \u2014 made a difference.", "So I think that could help.", " You know what\u2019s funny?", "She went over a minute over, and you don\u2019t stop her.", "When I go one second over, it\u2019s like a big deal.", " It\u2019s really \u2014 it\u2019s really very interesting.", " Absolutely.", "I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable.", "I will be a president for all of our people.", "And I\u2019ll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.", " I would be a president for all of the people, African- Americans, the inner cities.", "Devastating what\u2019s happening to our inner cities.", "She\u2019s been talking about it for years.", "As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens.", "She doesn\u2019t get it done.", " But I will tell you, she\u2019s all talk.", "It doesn\u2019t get done.", "All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run.", "Take a look at upstate New York.", " It turned out to be a disaster.", " Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.", " Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country.", "If you don\u2019t vote for me, I still want to be your president.", " I want to be the best president I can be for every American.", " Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters.", "It\u2019s with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans.", " Because we talked about what we wanted to do.", "We might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debates...", " ... but we believed that we could make the country better.", "And I was proud of that.", " We have a divided nation.", "We have a very divided nation.", "You look at Charlotte.", "You look at Baltimore.", "You look at the violence that\u2019s taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C.", " She\u2019s got tremendous \u2014 she\u2019s got tremendous hatred.", "And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting with her.", " No, there wasn\u2019t check out a sex tape.", "It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.", " By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi.", "She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning?", "Guess what?", "She didn\u2019t answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens...", " ... 600 \u2014 wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times.", "Well, she said she was awake at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, but I won\u2019t even mention that.", "But she said she\u2019ll be awake.", "Who\u2019s going \u2014 the famous thing, we\u2019re going to answer our call at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning.", "Guess what happened?", "Ambassador Stevens \u2014 Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help.", "And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who\u2019s her friend and not a good guy, by the way.", "So, you know, she shouldn\u2019t be talking about that.", " No.", " I\u2019m shocked to hear that.", " Well, it\u2019s not only my opinion.", "It\u2019s the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress.", "But it\u2019s in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it\u2019s not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody.", "Everybody.", "African-American incomes went up 33 percent.", " Nine million people lost their jobs.", " Five million homes were lost.", " And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.", "We are back on the right track.", "He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans.", " We have the slowest growth since 1929.", " It is \u2014 our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.", " Thank you.", "Well, you\u2019re right.", "This is one of the most important issues in this election.", "I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.", " Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently.", "And we have a vacancy.", "I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia.", "I\u2019m looking for judges \u2014 and I\u2019ve actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.", " Well...", " The question was about the Supreme Court.", "And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment.", "But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole.", " Thank you.", " We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.", " Absolutely.", "I think it\u2019s such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration.", "Under absolutely siege.", "The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies.", "And foreign companies are now coming in buying our \u2014 buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.", " It\u2019s an absolute disgrace.", " Secretary Clinton, two minutes.", " And actually \u2014 well, that was very interesting.", "First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business.", "That\u2019s something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don\u2019t get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.", " But the price of coal is down worldwide.", "So we have to look at this comprehensively.", " And that\u2019s exactly what I have proposed.", "I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.", " Well, I certainly will, because I think that\u2019s a very fair and important question.", "Look, I respect his children.", "His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald.", "I don\u2019t agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that.", "And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.", " Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment.", "I don\u2019t know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great \u2014 I\u2019m very proud of my children.", "And they\u2019ve done a wonderful job, and they\u2019ve been wonderful, wonderful kids.", "So I consider that a compliment.", " Well, thank you very much, Jim, and thanks to the commission and the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, for hosting us tonight.", "I can't think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country.", "You know, we are at a defining moment in our history.", "Our nation is involved in two wars, and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.", "And although we've heard a lot about Wall Street, those of you on Main Street I think have been struggling for a while, and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy.", "And you're wondering, how's it going to affect me?", "How's it going to affect my job?", "How's it going to affect my house?", "How's it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college?", "So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely.", "And I've put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort.", "Number one, we've got to make sure that we've got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money.", "Number two, we've got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market -- and when the market returns.", "Number three, we've got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes.", "And, number four, we've got to make sure that we're helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country.", "Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down.", "It hasn't worked.", "And I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake.", "That's why I'm running for president, and that's what I hope we're going to be talking about tonight.", " We haven't seen the language yet.", "And I do think that there's constructive work being done out there.", "So, for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan.", "The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place?", "Two years ago, I warned that, because of the subprime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time.", "Last year, I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it.", "So -- so the question, I think, that we've got to ask ourselves is, yes, we've got to solve this problem short term.", "And we are going to have to intervene; there's no doubt about that.", "But we're also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations?", "We did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems.", "And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad.", " Well, I think Senator McCain's absolutely right that we need more responsibility, but we need it not just when there's a crisis.", "I mean, we've had years in which the reigning economic ideology has been what's good for Wall Street, but not what's good for Main Street.", "And there are folks out there who've been struggling before this crisis took place.", "And that's why it's so important, as we solve this short-term problem, that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary Americans to go down, the -- a health care system that is broken, energy policies that are not working, because, you know, 10 days ago, John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.", " I do not think that they are.", " Well, the -- John, 10 days ago, you said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.", "And...", " The -- and I just fundamentally disagree.", "And unless we are holding ourselves accountable day in, day out, not just when there's a crisis for folks who have power and influence and can hire lobbyists, but for the nurse, the teacher, the police officer, who, frankly, at the end of each month, they've got a little financial crisis going on.", "They're having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments.", "We haven't been paying attention to them.", "And if you look at our tax policies, it's a classic example.", " Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up.", "And he's also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn't the case with me.", "But let's be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year's budget.", "Senator McCain is proposing -- and this is a fundamental difference between us -- $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion.", "Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important.", "And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out.", "So my attitude is, we've got to grow the economy from the bottom up.", "What I've called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent.", "And that means that the ordinary American out there who's collecting a paycheck every day, they've got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them.", "And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to -- wants to follow.", " I -- I don't know where John is getting his figures.", "Let's just be clear.", "What I do is I close corporate loopholes, stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that we're giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States.", "I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage.", "I think those are pretty important priorities.", "And I pay for every dime of it.", "But let's go back to the original point.", "John, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important.", "And, absolutely, we need earmark reform.", "And when I'm president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely.", "But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we're going to get the middle class back on track.", " And when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well, and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, I think that is a continuation of the last eight years, and we can't afford another four.", " Well, let me just make a couple of points.", " My definition -- here's what I can tell the American people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut.", "And if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dime's worth of tax increase.", "Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and he's absolutely right.", "Here's the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world.", "And what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more.", "It's not like you want to close the loopholes.", "You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes.", "And that's a problem.", "Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5,000 health credit.", "Now, what he doesn't tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits.", "So you may end up getting a $5,000 tax credit.", "Here's the only problem: Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that you're getting from your employer.", "And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, you've got to go out on the open market and try to buy it.", "It is not a good deal for the American people.", "But it's an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off we're going to be.", " John, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion.", " That's not true, John.", "That's not true.", " Look, it's just not true.", "And if we want to talk about oil company profits, under your tax plan, John -- this is undeniable -- oil companies would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.", "Now, look, we all would love to lower taxes on everybody.", "But here's the problem: If we are giving them to oil companies, then that means that there are those who are not going to be getting them.", "And...", " No, but, John, the fact of the matter is, is that I was opposed to those tax breaks, tried to strip them out.", "We've got an energy bill on the Senate floor right now that contains some good stuff, some stuff you want, including drilling off-shore, but you're opposed to it because it would strip away those tax breaks that have gone to oil companies.", " Well, there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed.", "We don't yet know what our tax revenues are going to be.", "The economy is slowing down, so it's hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year.", "But there's no doubt that we're not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done.", "There are some things that I think have to be done.", "We have to have energy independence, so I've put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years' time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on Middle Eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy, solar, wind, biodiesel, making sure that we're developing the fuel-efficient cars of the future right here in the United States, in Ohio and Michigan, instead of Japan and South Korea.", "We have to fix our health care system, which is putting an enormous burden on families.", "Just -- a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families.", "They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care.", "I'm meeting folks all over the country.", "We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off.", "The third thing we have to do is we've got to make sure that we're competing in education.", "We've got to invest in science and technology.", "China had a space launch and a space walk.", "We've got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science.", "And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America.", "And I also think that we're going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities.", "Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them.", "So there are some -- some things that we've got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy.", "We can't shortchange those things.", "We've got to eliminate programs that don't work, and we've got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less.", " No.", "As I said before, Jim, there are going to be things that end up having to be ...", " ... deferred and delayed.", "Well, look, I want to make sure that we are investing in energy in order to free ourselves from the dependence on foreign oil.", "That is a big project.", "That is a multi-year project.", " Not willing to give up the need to do it but there may be individual components that we can't do.", "But John is right we have to make cuts.", "We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system.", "Doesn't work any better through the private insurers.", "They just skim off $15 billion.", "That was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works.", "They did it on the Medicaid prescription drug bill and we have to change the culture.", "Tom -- or John mentioned me being wildly liberal.", "Mostly that's just me opposing George Bush's wrong headed policies since I've been in Congress but I think it is that it is also important to recognize I worked with Tom Coburn, the most conservative, one of the most conservative Republicans who John already mentioned to set up what we call a Google for government saying we'll list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who, in fact, is promoting some of these spending projects that John's been railing about.", " The problem with a spending freeze is you're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel.", "There are some programs that are very important that are under funded.", "I went to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this Medicare subsidy, I think, doesn't make sense.", "Let me tell you another place to look for some savings.", "We are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus.", "It seems to me that if we're going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close.", " There's no doubt it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gonna affect our budgets.", "There is no doubt about it.", "Not only -- Even if we get all $700 billion back, let's assume the markets recover, we're holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit.", "If we're lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term there's an outlay and we may not see that money for a while.", "And because of the economy's slowing down, I think we can also expect less tax revenue so there's no doubt that as president I'm going to have to make some tough decision.", "The only point I want to make is this, that in order to make those tough decisions we have to know what our values are and who we're fighting for and what our priorities are and if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who don't need them and weren't even asking for them, and we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country, then I think we have made a bad decision and I want to make sure we're not shortchanging our long term priorities.", " I just want to make this point, Jim.", "John, it's been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending.", "This orgy of spending and enormous deficits you voted for almost all of his budgets.", "So to stand here and after eight years and say that you're going to lead on controlling spending and, you know, balancing our tax cuts so that they help middle class families when over the last eight years that hasn't happened I think just is, you know, kind of hard to swallow.", " Well, this is an area where Senator McCain and I have a fundamental difference because I think the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place.", "Now six years ago, I stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world, and whether our intelligence was sound, but also because we hadn't finished the job in Afghanistan.", "We hadn't caught bin Laden.", "We hadn't put al Qaeda to rest, and as a consequence, I thought that it was going to be a distraction.", "Now Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment.", "And I wish I had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right, but that's not the case.", "We've spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion.", "We have lost over 4,000 lives.", "We have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001.", "We took our eye off the ball.", "And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government.", "So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and I will not, as president, in order to keep the American people safe.", "But we have to use our military wisely.", "And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq.", " Which point?", "He raised a whole bunch of them.", " Look, I'm very proud of my vice presidential selection, Joe Biden, who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and as he explains, and as John well knows, the issues of Afghanistan, the issues of Iraq, critical issues like that, don't go through my subcommittee because they're done as a committee as a whole.", "But that's Senate inside baseball.", "But let's get back to the core issue here.", "Senator McCain is absolutely right that the violence has been reduced as a consequence of the extraordinary sacrifice of our troops and our military families.", "They have done a brilliant job, and General Petraeus has done a brilliant job.", "But understand, that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war.", "And so John likes -- John, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007.", "You talk about the surge.", "The war started in 2003, and at the time when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy.", "You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were.", "You were wrong.", "You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators.", "You were wrong.", "You said that there was no history of violence between Shia and Sunni.", "And you were wrong.", "And so my question is...  (CROSSTALK)", " ... of judgment, of whether or not -- of whether or not -- if the question is who is best-equipped as the next president to make good decisions about how we use our military, how we make sure that we are prepared and ready for the next conflict, then I think we can take a look at our judgment.", " That's not true.", " That's not true.", " Jim, Jim, this is a big...", " Jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer.", "First of all, let's talk about this troop funding issue because John always brings this up.", "Senator McCain cut -- Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn't believe in a timetable.", "I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush.", "We had a difference on the timetable.", "We didn't have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops.", "We had a legitimate difference, and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy.", "And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there.", "The question is, was this wise?", "We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate.", "We need more troops there.", "We need more resources there.", "Senator McCain, in the rush to go into Iraq, said, you know what?", "We've been successful in Afghanistan.", "There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there.", "This is a time when bin Laden was still out, and now they've reconstituted themselves.", "Secretary of Defense Robert Gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in Afghanistan and it needs to end there.", "But we can't do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country.", "Now, what I've said is we should end this war responsibly.", "We should do it in phases.", "But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put -- provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda.", "And right now, the commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have acknowledged that we don't have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge.", " That's not the case.", " What he said was a precipitous...", " ... withdrawal would be dangerous.", "He did not say that.", "That's not true.", " Yes, I think we need more troops.", "I've been saying that for over a year now.", "And I think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because it's been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better.", "We had the highest fatalities among U.S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002.", "And we are seeing a major offensive taking place -- Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion.", "They are feeling emboldened.", "And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we don't have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan.", "So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan.", "Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no Al Qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan.", "And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front -- that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan.", "So here's what we have to do comprehensively, though.", "It's not just more troops.", "We have to press the Afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people.", "And I've said this to President Karzai.", "Number two, we've got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years.", "Number three, we've got to deal with Pakistan, because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, we've been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens.", "And until we do, Americans here at home are not going to be safe.", " Nobody talked about attacking Pakistan.", "Here's what I said.", "And if John wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the United States has Al Qaida, bin Laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out.", "Now, I think that's the right strategy; I think that's the right policy.", "And, John, I -- you're absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say.", "But, you know, coming from you, who, you know, in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and, you know, sung songs about bombing Iran, I don't know, you know, how credible that is.", "I think this is the right strategy.", "Now, Senator McCain is also right that it's difficult.", "This is not an easy situation.", "You've got cross-border attacks against U.S. troops.", "And we've got a choice.", "We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions.", "And the problem, John, with the strategy that's been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled Musharraf, we alienated the Pakistani population, because we were anti-democratic.", "We had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, \"Well, you know, he may be a dictator, but he's our dictator.\"", "And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan.", "We spent $10 billion.", "And in the meantime, they weren't going after Al Qaida, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan.", "That's going to change when I'm president of the United States.", " Jim, let me just make a point.", "I've got a bracelet, too, from Sergeant - from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopeck (ph), given to me in green bay.", "She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what I'm going through.", "No U.S. soldier ever dies in vain because they're carrying out the missions of their commander in chief.", "And we honor all the service that they've provided.", "Our troops have performed brilliantly.", "The question is for the next president, are we making good judgments about how to keep America safe precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step.", "And the point that I originally made is that we took our eye off Afghanistan, we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9/11, they are still sending out videotapes and Senator McCain, nobody is talking about defeat in Iraq, but I have to say we are having enormous problems in Afghanistan because of that decision.", "And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan.", "At one point, while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can \"muddle through\" Afghanistan.", "You don't muddle through the central front on terror and you don't muddle through going after bin Laden.", "You don't muddle through stamping out the Taliban.", "I think that is something we have to take seriously.", "And when I'm president, I will.", " A testimony to you, Jim.", " Well, let me just correct something very quickly.", "I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization.", "I've consistently said so.", "What Senator McCain refers to is a measure in the Senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of Iraq.", "To deal with Iran.", "And ironically, the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq.", "Iraq was Iran's mortal enemy.", "That was cleared away.", "And what we've seen over the last several years is Iran's influence grow.", "They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon.", "So obviously, our policy over the last eight years has not worked.", "Senator McCain is absolutely right, we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran.", "It would be a game changer.", "Not only would it threaten Israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this Middle East.", "Now here's what we need to do.", "We do need tougher sanctions.", "I do not agree with Senator McCain that we're going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with countries like Russia and China that are, I think Senator McCain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon.", "But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked.", "It has not worked in Iran, it has not worked in North Korea.", "In each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons.", "That will change when I'm president of the United States.", " So let's talk about this.", "First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran.", "So he may not be the right person to talk to.", "But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it's going to keep America safe.", "And I'm glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy.", " Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, who's one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran -- guess what -- without precondition.", "This is one of your own advisers.", "Now, understand what this means \"without preconditions.\"", "It doesn't mean that you invite them over for tea one day.", "What it means is that we don't do what we've been doing, which is to say, \"Until you agree to do exactly what we say, we won't have direct contacts with you.\"", "There's a difference between preconditions and preparation.", "Of course we've got to do preparations, starting with low-level diplomatic talks, and it may not work, because Iran is a rogue regime.", "But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with Iran.", "And you know what?", "President Bush recently sent a senior ambassador, Bill Burns, to participate in talks with the Europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons.", "Again, it may not work, but if it doesn't work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned.", "And when we haven't done it, as in North Korea -- let me just take one more example -- in North Korea, we cut off talks.", "They're a member of the axis of evil.", "We can't deal with them.", "And you know what happened?", "They went -- they quadrupled their nuclear capacity.", "They tested a nuke.", "They tested missiles.", "They pulled out of the nonproliferation agreement.", "And they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like Syria.", "When we re-engaged -- because, again, the Bush administration reversed course on this -- then we have at least made some progress, although right now, because of the problems in North Korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground.", "And -- and I just -- so I just have to make this general point that the Bush administration, some of Senator McCain's own advisers all think this is important, and Senator McCain appears resistant.", "He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he -- you know, he wasn't sure whether they were aligned with us.", "I mean, Spain?", "Spain is a NATO ally.", " If we can't meet with our friends, I don't know how we're going to lead the world in terms of dealing with critical issues like terrorism.", " Of course not.", " Look, I mean, Senator McCain keeps on using this example that suddenly the president would just meet with somebody without doing any preparation, without having low-level talks.", "Nobody's been talking about that, and Senator McCain knows it.", "This is a mischaracterization of my position.", "When we talk about preconditions -- and Henry Kissinger did say we should have contacts without preconditions -- the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks.", "And, you know, the Bush administration has come to recognize that it hasn't worked, this notion that we are simply silent when it comes to our enemies.", "And the notion that we would sit with Ahmadinejad and not say anything while he's spewing his nonsense and his vile comments is ridiculous.", "Nobody is even talking about that.", " No, let me tell... (CROSSTALK)", " We will take a look.", " Nobody's talking about that.", " I am not parsing words.", " I'm using the same words that your advisers use.", "Please, go ahead.", " Well, I think that, given what's happened over the last several weeks and months, our entire Russian approach has to be evaluated, because a resurgent and very aggressive Russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the region.", "Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable.", "They were unwarranted.", "And at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six-party -- or the six-point cease-fire.", "They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia.", "It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship.", "And we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region, you know, the Estonians, the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the Poles, the Czechs, that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts.", "They are members of NATO.", "And to countries like Georgia and the Ukraine, I think we have to insist that they are free to join NATO if they meet the requirements, and they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in.", "Now, we also can't return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia.", "It's important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest.", "One is nuclear proliferation.", "They have not only 15,000 nuclear warheads, but they've got enough to make another 40,000, and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of Al Qaida.", "This is an area where I've led on in the Senate, working with a Republican ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Dick Lugar, to deal with the proliferation of loose nuclear weapons.", "That's an area where we're going to have to work with Russia.", "But we have to have a president who is clear that you don't deal with Russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul.", "You deal with Russia based on, what are your -- what are the national security interests of the United States of America?", "And we have to recognize that the way they've been behaving lately demands a sharp response from the international community and our allies.", " No, actually, I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these issues.", "Obviously, I disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to Russians going into Georgia.", "I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable.", "And, absolutely, I wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on Georgia, and that's why I was the first to say that we have to rebuild the Georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild.", "Because part of Russia's intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more.", "Two points I think are important to think about when it comes to Russia.", "Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems.", "So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory.", "That made no sense whatsoever.", "And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over.", "That wasn't done.", "But had it been done, it's possible we could have avoided the issue.", "The second point I want to make is -- is the issue of energy.", "Russia is in part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as Senator McCain mentioned.", "That means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil -- 25 percent of the world's oil -- have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with Russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states we've talked about, Iran, Venezuela.", "And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world's oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.", "So we can't simply drill our way out of the problem.", "What we're going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology.", "And, you know, I've got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that.", "And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record.", "Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel.", "And so we -- we -- we've got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump -- and, you know, winter's coming and home heating oil -- as it is our national security and the issue of climate change that's so important.", " That's just not true, John.", "John, I'm sorry, but that's not true.", " I just have to respond very quickly, just to correct -- just to correct the record.", " John?", " I -- I just have to correct the record here.", "I have never said that I object to nuclear waste.", "What I've said is that we have to store it safely.", "And, Senator McCain, he says -- he talks about Arizona.", " I've got to make this point, Jim.", " He objects...", " He -- he -- he objects... (CROSSTALK)", " He objected...", " All right, fair enough.", "Let's move on.", "You've got one more energy -- you've got one more question.", " Well, first of all, I think that we are safer in some ways.", "Obviously, we've poured billions of dollars into airport security.", "We have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go.", "We've got to make sure that we're hardening our chemical sites.", "We haven't done enough in terms of transit; we haven't done enough in terms of ports.", "And the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies.", "It's in a suitcase.", "This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important.", "It is the -- the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons.", "And we -- we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense.", "And I actually believe that we need missile defense, because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but I also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then we're making a mistake.", "The other thing that we have to focus on, though, is Al Qaida.", "They are now operating in 60 countries.", "We can't simply be focused on Iraq.", "We have to go to the root cause, and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan.", "That's going to be critical.", "We are going to need more cooperation with our allies.", "And one last point I want to make.", "It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism.", "And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore America's standing in the world.", "We are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago.", " And this is the greatest country on Earth.", "But because of some of the mistakes that have been made -- and I give Senator McCain great credit on the torture issue, for having identified that as something that undermines our long-term security -- because of those things, we, I think, are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that America is that shining beacon on a hill.", " Oh, there's no doubt.", "Look, over the last eight years, this administration, along with Senator McCain, have been solely focused on Iraq.", "That has been their priority.", "That has been where all our resources have gone.", "In the meantime, bin Laden is still out there.", "He is not captured.", "He is not killed.", "Al Qaida is resurgent.", "In the meantime, we've got challenges, for example, with China, where we are borrowing billions of dollars.", "They now hold a trillion dollars' worth of our debt.", "And they are active in countries like -- in regions like Latin America, and Asia, and Africa.", "They are -- the conspicuousness of their presence is only matched by our absence, because we've been focused on Iraq.", "We have weakened our capacity to project power around the world because we have viewed everything through this single lens, not to mention, look at our economy.", "We are now spending $10 billion or more every month.", "And that means we can't provide health care to people who need it.", "We can't invest in science and technology, which will determine whether or not we are going to be competitive in the long term.", "There has never been a country on Earth that saw its economy decline and yet maintained its military superiority.", "So this is a national security issue.", "We haven't adequately funded veterans' care.", "I sit on the Veterans Affairs Committee, and we've got -- I meet veterans all across the country who are trying to figure out, \"How can I get disability payments?", "I've got post-traumatic stress disorder, and yet I can't get treatment.\"", "So we have put all chips in, right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war.", "What we are talking about is recognizing that the next president has to have a broader strategic vision about all the challenges that we face.", "That's been missing over the last eight years.", "That sense is something that I want to restore.", " Well, let me just make a closing point.", "You know, my father came from Kenya.", "That's where I get my name.", "And in the '60s, he wrote letter after letter to come to college here in the United States because the notion was that there was no other country on Earth where you could make it if you tried.", "The ideals and the values of the United States inspired the entire world.", "I don't think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the United States, is the same.", "And part of what we need to do, what the next president has to do -- and this is part of our judgment, this is part of how we're going to keep America safe -- is to -- to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education, we are going to invest in issues that -- that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams.", "And that is something that I'm going to be committed to as president of the United States.", " Nice to meet you.", " It's a pleasure.", " Hey, can I call you Joe?", " (OFF-MIKE)", " Thank you.Thank you, Gwen.", "Thank you.", "Thank you.", " Let me begin by thanking you, Gwen, for hosting this.And, Governor, it's a pleasure to meet you, and it's a pleasure to be with you.I think it's neither the best or worst of Washington, but it's evidence of the fact that the economic policies of the last eight years have been the worst economic policies we've ever had.", "As a consequence, you've seen what's happened on Wall Street.If you need any more proof positive of how bad the economic theories have been, this excessive deregulation, the failure to oversee what was going on, letting Wall Street run wild, I don't think you needed any more evidence than what you see now.So the Congress has been put -- Democrats and Republicans have been put in a very difficult spot.", "But Barack Obama laid out four basic criteria for any kind of rescue plan here.", "He, first of all, said there has to be oversight.", "We're not going to write any check to anybody unless there's oversight for the -- of the secretary of Treasury.", "He secondly said you have to focus on homeowners and folks on Main Street.", "Thirdly, he said that you have to treat the taxpayers like investors in this case.", "And, lastly, what you have to do is make sure that CEOs don't benefit from this, because this could end up, in the long run, people making money off of this rescue plan.", "And so, as a consequence of that, it brings us back to maybe the fundamental disagreement between Governor Palin and me and Senator McCain and Barack Obama, and that is that the -- we're going to fundamentally change the focus of the economic policy.", "We're going to focus on the middle class, because it's -- when the middle class is growing, the economy grows and everybody does well, not just focus on the wealthy and corporate America.", " Thank you, Gwen.", "And I thank the commission, also.", "I appreciate this privilege of being able to be here and speak with Americans.You know, I think a good barometer here, as we try to figure out has this been a good time or a bad time in America's economy, is go to a kid's soccer game on Saturday, and turn to any parent there on the sideline and ask them, \"How are you feeling about the economy?\"", "And I'll bet you, you're going to hear some fear in that parent's voice, fear regarding the few investments that some of us have in the stock market.", "Did we just take a major hit with those investments?", "Fear about, how are we going to afford to send our kids to college?", "A fear, as small-business owners, perhaps, how we're going to borrow any money to increase inventory or hire more people.", "The barometer there, I think, is going to be resounding that our economy is hurting and the federal government has not provided the sound oversight that we need and that we deserve, and we need reform to that end.", "Now, John McCain thankfully has been one representing reform.", "Two years ago, remember, it was John McCain who pushed so hard with the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reform measures.", "He sounded that warning bell.", "People in the Senate with him, his colleagues, didn't want to listen to him and wouldn't go towards that reform that was needed then.", "I think that the alarm has been heard, though, and there will be that greater oversight, again thanks to John McCain's bipartisan efforts that he was so instrumental in bringing folks together over this past week, even suspending his own campaign to make sure he was putting excessive politics aside and putting the country first.", " Well, that's what I've done my whole career, Gwen, on very, very controversial issues, from dealing with violence against women, to putting 100,000 police officers on the street, to trying to get something done about the genocide in -- that was going on in Bosnia.And I -- I have been able to reach across the aisle.", "I think it's fair to say that I have almost as many friends on the Republican side of the aisle as I do the Democratic side of the aisle.", "But am I able to respond to -- are we able to stay on the -- on the topic?", " Yes, well, you know, until two weeks ago -- it was two Mondays ago John McCain said at 9 o'clock in the morning that the fundamentals of the economy were strong.", "Two weeks before that, he said George -- we've made great economic progress under George Bush's policies.Nine o'clock, the economy was strong.", "Eleven o'clock that same day, two Mondays ago, John McCain said that we have an economic crisis.", "That doesn't make John McCain a bad guy, but it does point out he's out of touch.", "Those folks on the sidelines knew that two months ago.", " John McCain, in referring to the fundamental of our economy being strong, he was talking to and he was talking about the American workforce.", "And the American workforce is the greatest in this world, with the ingenuity and the work ethic that is just entrenched in our workforce.", "That's a positive.", "That's encouragement.", "And that's what John McCain meant.Now, what I've done as a governor and as a mayor is (inaudible) I've had that track record of reform.", "And I've joined this team that is a team of mavericks with John McCain, also, with his track record of reform, where we're known for putting partisan politics aside to just get the job done.", "Now, Barack Obama, of course, he's pretty much only voted along his party lines.", "In fact, 96 percent of his votes have been solely along party line, not having that proof for the American people to know that his commitment, too, is, you know, put the partisanship, put the special interests aside, and get down to getting business done for the people of America.", "We're tired of the old politics as usual.", "And that's why, with all due respect, I do respect your years in the U.S. Senate, but I think Americans are craving something new and different and that new energy and that new commitment that's going to come with reform.", "I think that's why we need to send the maverick from the Senate and put him in the White House, and I'm happy to join him there.", " Darn right it was the predator lenders, who tried to talk Americans into thinking that it was smart to buy a $300,000 house if we could only afford a $100,000 house.", "There was deception there, and there was greed and there is corruption on Wall Street.", "And we need to stop that.Again, John McCain and I, that commitment that we have made, and we're going to follow through on that, getting rid of that corruption.", " One thing that Americans do at this time, also, though, is let's commit ourselves just every day American people, Joe Six Pack, hockey moms across the nation, I think we need to band together and say never again.", "Never will we be exploited and taken advantage of again by those who are managing our money and loaning us these dollars.", "We need to make sure that we demand from the federal government strict oversight of those entities in charge of our investments and our savings and we need also to not get ourselves in debt.", "Let's do what our parents told us before we probably even got that first credit card.", "Don't live outside of our means.", "We need to make sure that as individuals we're taking personal responsibility through all of this.", "It's not the American peoples\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault that the economy is hurting like it is, but we have an opportunity to learn a heck of a lot of good lessons through this and say never again will we be taken advantage of.", " Well Gwen, two years ago Barack Obama warned about the sub prime mortgage crisis.", "John McCain said shortly after that in December he was surprised there was a sub prime mortgage problem.", "John McCain while Barack Obama was warning about what we had to do was literally giving an interview to \"The Wall Street Journal\" saying that I'm always for cutting regulations.", "We let Wall Street run wild.", "John McCain and he's a good man, but John McCain thought the answer is that tried and true Republican response, deregulate, deregulate.So what you had is you had overwhelming \"deregulation.\"", "You had actually the belief that Wall Street could self-regulate itself.", "And while Barack Obama was talking about reinstating those regulations, John on 20 different occasions in the previous year and a half called for more deregulation.", "As a matter of fact, John recently wrote an article in a major magazine saying that he wants to do for the health care industry deregulate it and let the free market move like he did for the banking industry.", "So deregulation was the promise.", "And guess what?", "Those people who say don't go into debt, they can barely pay to fill up their gas tank.", "I was recently at my local gas station and asked a guy named Joey Danco (ph).", "I said Joey, how much did it cost to fill your tank?", "You know what his answer was?", "He said I don't know, Joe.", "I never have enough money to do it.", "The middle class needs relief, tax relief.", "They need it now.", "They need help now.", "The focus will change with Barack Obama.", " I would like to respond about the tax increases.", "We can speak in agreement here that darn right we need tax relief for Americans so that jobs can be created here.", "Now, Barack Obama and Senator Biden also voted for the largest tax increases in U.S. history.", "Barack had 94 opportunities to side on the people's side and reduce taxes and 94 times he voted to increase taxes or not support a tax reduction, 94 times.Now, that's not what we need to create jobs and really bolster and heat up our economy.", "We do need the private sector to be able to keep more of what we earn and produce.", "Government is going to have to learn to be more efficient and live with less if that's what it takes to reign in the government growth that we've seen today.", "But we do need tax relief and Barack Obama even supported increasing taxes as late as last year for those families making only $42,000 a year.", "That's a lot of middle income average American families to increase taxes on them.", "I think that is the way to kill jobs and to continue to harm our economy.", " The charge is absolutely not true.", "Barack Obama did not vote to raise taxes.", "The vote she's referring to, John McCain voted the exact same way.", "It was a budget procedural vote.", "John McCain voted the same way.", "It did not raise taxes.", "Number two, using the standard that the governor uses, John McCain voted 477 times to raise taxes.", "It's a bogus standard it but if you notice, Gwen, the governor did not answer the question about deregulation, did not answer the question of defending John McCain about not going along with the deregulation, letting Wall Street run wild.", "He did support deregulation almost across the board.", "That's why we got into so much trouble.", " I'm still on the tax thing because I want to correct you on that again.", "And I want to let you know what I did as a mayor and as a governor.", "And I may not answer the questions the way that either the moderator or you want to hear, but I'm going to talk straight to the American people and let them know my track record also.", "As mayor, every year I was in office I did reduce taxes.", "I eliminated personal property taxes and eliminated small business inventory taxes and as governor we suspended our state fuel tax.", "We did all of those things knowing that that is how our economy would be heated up.", "Now, as for John McCain's adherence to rules and regulations and pushing for even harder and tougher regulations, that is another thing that he is known for though.", "Look at the tobacco industry.", "Look at campaign finance reform.", " Well Gwen, where I come from, it's called fairness, just simple fairness.", "The middle class is struggling.", "The middle class under John McCain's tax proposal, 100 million families, middle class families, households to be precise, they got not a single change, they got not a single break in taxes.", "No one making less than $250,000 under Barack Obama's plan will see one single penny of their tax raised whether it's their capital gains tax, their income tax, investment tax, any tax.", "And 95 percent of the people in the United States of America making less than $150,000 will get a tax break.Now, that seems to me to be simple fairness.", "The economic engine of America is the middle class.", "It's the people listening to this broadcast.", "When you do well, America does well.", "Even the wealthy do well.", "This is not punitive.", "John wants to add $300 million, billion in new tax cuts per year for corporate America and the very wealthy while giving virtually nothing to the middle class.", "We have a different value set.", "The middle class is the economic engine.", "It's fair.", "They deserve the tax breaks, not the super wealthy who are doing pretty well.", "They don't need any more tax breaks.", "And by the way, they'll pay no more than they did under Ronald Reagan.", " I do take issue with some of the principle there with that redistribution of wealth principle that seems to be espoused by you.", "But when you talk about Barack's plan to tax increase affecting only those making $250,000 a year or more, you're forgetting the millions of small businesses that are going to fit into that category.", "So they're going to be the ones paying higher taxes thus resulting in fewer jobs being created and less productivity.Now you said recently that higher taxes or asking for higher taxes or paying higher taxes is patriotic.", "In the middle class of America which is where Todd and I have been all of our lives, that's not patriotic.", "Patriotic is saying, government, you know, you're not always the solution.", "In fact, too often you're the problem so, government, lessen the tax burden and on our families and get out of the way and let the private sector and our families grow and thrive and prosper.", "An increased tax formula that Barack Obama is proposing in addition to nearly a trillion dollars in new spending that he's proposing is the backwards way of trying to grow our economy.", " I am because he's got a good health care plan that is detailed.", "And I want to give you a couple details on that.", "He's proposing a $5,000 tax credit for families so that they can get out there and they can purchase their own health care coverage.", "That's a smart thing to do.", "That's budget neutral.", "That doesn't cost the government anything as opposed to Barack Obama's plan to mandate health care coverage and have this universal government run program and unless you're pleased with the way the federal government has been running anything lately, I don't think that it's going to be real pleasing for Americans to consider health care being taken over by the feds.", "But a $5,000 health care credit through our income tax that's budget neutral.", "That's going to help.", "And he also wants to erase those artificial lines between states so that through competition, we can cross state lines and if there's a better plan offered somewhere else, we would be able to purchase that.", "So affordability and accessibility will be the keys there with that $5,000 tax credit also being offered.", " Gwen, I don't know where to start.", "We don't call a redistribution in my neighborhood Scranton, Claymont, Wilmington, the places I grew up, to give the fair to say that not giving Exxon Mobil another $4 billion tax cut this year as John calls for and giving it to middle class people to be able to pay to get their kids to college, we don't call that redistribution.", "We call that fairness number one.", "Number two fact, 95 percent of the small businesses in America, their owners make less than $250,000 a year.", "They would not get one single solitary penny increase in taxes, those small businesses.", " Now, with regard to the -- to the health care plan, you know, it's with one hand you giveth, the other you take it.", "You know how Barack Obama -- excuse me, do you know how John McCain pays for his $5,000 tax credit you're going to get, a family will get?He taxes as income every one of you out there, every one of you listening who has a health care plan through your employer.", "That's how he raises $3.6 trillion, on your -- taxing your health care benefit to give you a $5,000 plan, which his Web site points out will go straight to the insurance company.", "And then you're going to have to replace a $12,000 -- that's the average cost of the plan you get through your employer -- it costs $12,000.", "You're going to have to pay -- replace a $12,000 plan, because 20 million of you are going to be dropped.", "Twenty million of you will be dropped.", "So you're going to have to place -- replace a $12,000 plan with a $5,000 check you just give to the insurance company.", "I call that the \"Ultimate Bridge to Nowhere.\"", " Well, the one thing we might have to slow down is a commitment we made to double foreign assistance.", "We'll probably have to slow that down.We also are going to make sure that we do not go forward with the tax cut proposals of the administration -- of John McCain, the existing one for people making over $250,000, which is $130 billion this year alone.", "We're not going to support the $300 billion tax cut that they have for corporate America and the very wealthy.", "We're not going to support another $4 billion tax cut for ExxonMobil.", "And what we're not going to also hold up on, Gwen, is we cannot afford to hold up on providing for incentives for new jobs by an energy policy, creating new jobs.", "We cannot slow up on education, because that's the engine that is going to give us the economic growth and competitiveness that we need.", "And we are not going to slow up on the whole idea of providing for affordable health care for Americans, none of which, when we get to talk about health care, is as my -- as the governor characterized -- characterized.", "The bottom line here is that we are going to, in fact, eliminate those wasteful spending that exist in the budget right now, a number of things I don't have time, because the light is blinking, that I won't be able to mention, but one of which is the $100 billion tax dodge that, in fact, allows people to take their post office box off- shore, avoid taxes.", "I call that unpatriotic.", "I call that unpatriotic.", " That's what I'm talking about.", " Well, the nice thing about running with John McCain is I can assure you he doesn't tell one thing to one group and then turns around and tells something else to another group, including his plans that will make this bailout plan, this rescue plan, even better.I want to go back to the energy plan, though, because this is -- this is an important one that Barack Obama, he voted for in '05.", "Senator Biden, you would remember that, in that energy plan that Obama voted for, that's what gave those oil companies those big tax breaks.", "Your running mate voted for that.", "You know what I had to do in the state of Alaska?", "I had to take on those oil companies and tell them, \"No,\" you know, any of the greed there that has been kind of instrumental, I guess, in their mode of operation, that wasn't going to happen in my state.", "And that's why Tillerson at Exxon and Mulva at ConocoPhillips, bless their hearts, they're doing what they need to do, as corporate CEOs, but they're not my biggest fans, because what I had to do up there in Alaska was to break up a monopoly up there and say, you know, the people are going to come first and we're going to make sure that we have value given to the people of Alaska with those resources.", "And those huge tax breaks aren't coming to the big multinational corporations anymore, not when it adversely affects the people who live in a state and, in this case, in a country who should be benefiting at the same time.", "So it was Barack Obama who voted for that energy plan that gave those tax breaks to the oil companies that I then had to turn around, as a governor of an energy-producing state, and kind of undo in my own area of expertise, and that's energy.", " There is not.", "And how long have I been at this, like five weeks?", "So there hasn't been a whole lot that I've promised, except to do what is right for the American people, put government back on the side of the American people, stop the greed and corruption on Wall Street.And the rescue plan has got to include that massive oversight that Americans are expecting and deserving.", "And I don't believe that John McCain has made any promise that he would not be able to keep, either.", " Again, let me -- let's talk about those tax breaks.", "Barack Obama -- Obama voted for an energy bill because, for the first time, it had real support for alternative energy.When there were separate votes on eliminating the tax breaks for the oil companies, Barack Obama voted to eliminate them.", "John did not.", "And let me just ask a rhetorical question: If John really wanted to eliminate them, why is he adding to his budget an additional $4 billion in tax cuts for ExxonMobils of the world that, in fact, already have made $600 billion since 2001?", "And, look, I agree with the governor.", "She imposed a windfall profits tax up there in Alaska.", "That's what Barack Obama and I want to do.", "We want to be able to do for all of you Americans, give you back $1,000 bucks, like she's been able to give back money to her folks back there.", "But John McCain will not support a windfall profits tax.", "They've made $600 billion since 2001, and John McCain wants to give them, all by itself -- separate, no additional bill, all by itself -- another $4 billion tax cut.", "If that is not proof of what I say, I'm not sure what can be.", "So I hope the governor is able to convince John McCain to support our windfall profits tax, which she supported in Alaska, and I give her credit for it.", " Yes, I would have.", "But here, again, there have -- there have been so many changes in the conditions of our economy in just even these past weeks that there has been more and more revelation made aware now to Americans about the corruption and the greed on Wall Street.We need to look back, even two years ago, and we need to be appreciative of John McCain's call for reform with Fannie Mae, with Freddie Mac, with the mortgage-lenders, too, who were starting to really kind of rear that head of abuse.", "And the colleagues in the Senate weren't going to go there with him.", "So we have John McCain to thank for at least warning people.", "And we also have John McCain to thank for bringing in a bipartisan effort people to the table so that we can start putting politics aside, even putting a campaign aside, and just do what's right to fix this economic problem that we are in.", "It is a crisis.", "It's a toxic mess, really, on Main Street that's affecting Wall Street.", "And now we have to be ever vigilant and also making sure that credit markets don't seize up.", "That's where the Main Streeters like me, that's where we would really feel the effects.", " Well, mortgage-holders didn't pay the price.", "Only 10 percent of the people who are -- have been affected by this whole switch from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13 -- it gets complicated.But the point of this -- Barack Obama saw the glass as half- empty.", "I saw it as half-full.", "We disagreed on that, and 85 senators voted one way, and 15 voted the other way.", "But here's the deal.", "Barack Obama pointed out two years ago that there was a subprime mortgage crisis and wrote to the secretary of Treasury.", "And he said, \"You'd better get on the stick here.", "You'd better look at it.\"", "John McCain said as early as last December, quote -- I'm paraphrasing -- \"I'm surprised about this subprime mortgage crisis,\" number one.", "Number two, with regard to bankruptcy now, Gwen, what we should be doing now -- and Barack Obama and I support it -- we should be allowing bankruptcy courts to be able to re-adjust not just the interest rate you're paying on your mortgage to be able to stay in your home, but be able to adjust the principal that you owe, the principal that you owe.", "That would keep people in their homes, actually help banks by keeping it from going under.", "But John McCain, as I understand it -- I'm not sure of this, but I believe John McCain and the governor don't support that.", "There are ways to help people now.", "And there -- ways that we're offering are not being supported by -- by the Bush administration nor do I believe by John McCain and Governor Palin.", " That is not so, but because that's just a quick answer, I want to talk about, again, my record on energy versus your ticket's energy ticket, also.I think that this is important to come back to, with that energy policy plan again that was voted for in '05.", "When we talk about energy, we have to consider the need to do all that we can to allow this nation to become energy independent.", "It's a nonsensical position that we are in when we have domestic supplies of energy all over this great land.", "And East Coast politicians who don't allow energy-producing states like Alaska to produce these, to tap into them, and instead we're relying on foreign countries to produce for us.", " We're circulating about $700 billion a year into foreign countries, some who do not like America -- they certainly don't have our best interests at heart -- instead of those dollars circulating here, creating tens of thousands of jobs and allowing domestic supplies of energy to be tapped into and start flowing into these very, very hungry markets.Energy independence is the key to this nation's future, to our economic future, and to our national security.", "So when we talk about energy plans, it's not just about who got a tax break and who didn't.", "And we're not giving oil companies tax breaks, but it's about a heck of a lot more than that.", "Energy independence is the key to America's future.", " Yes.", "Well, as the nation's only Arctic state and being the governor of that state, Alaska feels and sees impacts of climate change more so than any other state.", "And we know that it's real.I'm not one to attribute every man -- activity of man to the changes in the climate.", "There is something to be said also for man's activities, but also for the cyclical temperature changes on our planet.", "But there are real changes going on in our climate.", "And I don't want to argue about the causes.", "What I want to argue about is, how are we going to get there to positively affect the impacts?", "We have got to clean up this planet.", "We have got to encourage other nations also to come along with us with the impacts of climate change, what we can do about that.", "As governor, I was the first governor to form a climate change sub-cabinet to start dealing with the impacts.", "We've got to reduce emissions.", "John McCain is right there with an \"all of the above\" approach to deal with climate change impacts.", "We've got to become energy independent for that reason.", "Also as we rely more and more on other countries that don't care as much about the climate as we do, we're allowing them to produce and to emit and even pollute more than America would ever stand for.", "So even in dealing with climate change, it's all the more reason that we have an \"all of the above\" approach, tapping into alternative sources of energy and conserving fuel, conserving our petroleum products and our hydrocarbons so that we can clean up this planet and deal with climate change.", " Well, I think it is manmade.", "I think it's clearly manmade.", "And, look, this probably explains the biggest fundamental difference between John McCain and Barack Obama and Sarah Palin and Joe Biden -- Governor Palin and Joe Biden.If you don't understand what the cause is, it's virtually impossible to come up with a solution.", "We know what the cause is.", "The cause is manmade.", "That's the cause.", "That's why the polar icecap is melting.", "Now, let's look at the facts.", "We have 3 percent of the world's oil reserves.", "We consume 25 percent of the oil in the world.", "John McCain has voted 20 times in the last decade-and-a-half against funding alternative energy sources, clean energy sources, wind, solar, biofuels.", "The way in which we can stop the greenhouse gases from emitting.", "We believe -- Barack Obama believes by investing in clean coal and safe nuclear, we can not only create jobs in wind and solar here in the United States, we can export it.", "China is building one to three new coal-fired plants burning dirty coal per week.", "It's polluting not only the atmosphere but the West Coast of the United States.", "We should export the technology by investing in clean coal technology.", "We should be creating jobs.", "John McCain has voted 20 times against funding alternative energy sources and thinks, I guess, the only answer is drill, drill, drill.", "Drill we must, but it will take 10 years for one drop of oil to come out of any of the wells that are going to begun to be drilled.", "In the meantime, we're all going to be in real trouble.", " I have always supported it.", "That's a fact.", " Yes, Senator McCain does support this.", "The chant is \"drill, baby, drill.\"", "And that's what we hear all across this country in our rallies because people are so hungry for those domestic sources of energy to be tapped into.", "They know that even in my own energy-producing state we have billions of barrels of oil and hundreds of trillions of cubic feet of clean, green natural gas.", "And we're building a nearly $40 billion natural gas pipeline which is North America's largest and most you expensive infrastructure project ever to flow those sources of energy into hungry markets.Barack Obama and Senator Biden, you've said no to everything in trying to find a domestic solution to the energy crisis that we're in.", "You even called drilling -- safe, environmentally-friendly drilling offshore as raping the outer continental shelf.", "There -- with new technology, with tiny footprints even on land, it is safe to drill and we need to do more of that.", "But also in that \"all of the above\" approach that Senator McCain supports, the alternative fuels will be tapped into: the nuclear, the clean coal.", "I was surprised to hear you mention that because you had said that there isn't anything -- such a thing as clean coal.", "And I think you said it in a rope line, too, at one of your rallies.", " I do.", "I do.", " Absolutely.", "Absolutely we do.", "We call for setting hard targets, number one...", " Oh, I'm sorry.", " Oh, on clean coal.", "My record, just take a look at the record.", "My record for 25 years has supported clean coal technology.", "A comment made in a rope line was taken out of context.", "I was talking about exporting that technology to China so when they burn their dirty coal, it won't be as dirty, it will be clean.But here's the bottom line, Gwen: How do we deal with global warming with continued addition to carbon emissions?", "And if the only answer you have is oil, and John -- and the governor says John is for everything.", "Well, why did John vote 20 times?", "Maybe he's for everything as long as it's not helped forward by the government.", "Maybe he's for everything if the free market takes care of it.", "I don't know.", "But he voted 20 times against funding alternative energy sources.", " Absolutely.", "Do I support granting same-sex benefits?", "Absolutely positively.", "Look, in an Obama-Biden administration, there will be absolutely no distinction from a constitutional standpoint or a legal standpoint between a same-sex and a heterosexual couple.The fact of the matter is that under the Constitution we should be granted -- same-sex couples should be able to have visitation rights in the hospitals, joint ownership of property, life insurance policies, et cetera.", "That's only fair.", "It's what the Constitution calls for.", "And so we do support it.", "We do support making sure that committed couples in a same-sex marriage are guaranteed the same constitutional benefits as it relates to their property rights, their rights of visitation, their rights to insurance, their rights of ownership as heterosexual couples do.", " Well, not if it goes closer and closer towards redefining the traditional definition of marriage between one man and one woman.", "And unfortunately that's sometimes where those steps lead.But I also want to clarify, if there's any kind of suggestion at all from my answer that I would be anything but tolerant of adults in America choosing their partners, choosing relationships that they deem best for themselves, you know, I am tolerant and I have a very diverse family and group of friends and even within that group you would see some who may not agree with me on this issue, some very dear friends who don't agree with me on this issue.", "But in that tolerance also, no one would ever propose, not in a McCain-Palin administration, to do anything to prohibit, say, visitations in a hospital or contracts being signed, negotiated between parties.", "But I will tell Americans straight up that I don't support defining marriage as anything but between one man and one woman, and I think through nuances we can go round and round about what that actually means.", "But I'm being as straight up with Americans as I can in my non- support for anything but a traditional definition of marriage.", " No.", "Barack Obama nor I support redefining from a civil side what constitutes marriage.", "We do not support that.", "That is basically the decision to be able to be able to be left to faiths and people who practice their faiths the determination what you call it.The bottom line though is, and I'm glad to hear the governor, I take her at her word, obviously, that she think there should be no civil rights distinction, none whatsoever, between a committed gay couple and a committed heterosexual couple.", "If that's the case, we really don't have a difference.", " Your question to him was whether he supported gay marriage and my answer is the same as his and it is that I do not.", " I am very thankful that we do have a good plan and the surge and the counterinsurgency strategy in Iraq that has proven to work, I am thankful that that is part of the plan implemented under a great American hero, General Petraeus, and pushed hard by another great American, Senator John McCain.I know that the other ticket opposed this surge, in fact, even opposed funding for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.", "Barack Obama voted against funding troops there after promising that he would not do so.", " And Senator Biden, I respected you when you called him out on that.", "You said that his vote was political and you said it would cost lives.", "And Barack Obama at first said he would not do that.", "He turned around under political pressure and he voted against funding the troops.", "We do have a plan for withdrawal.", "We don't need early withdrawal out of Iraq.", "We cannot afford to lose there or we're going to be no better off in the war in Afghanistan either.", "We have got to win in Iraq.And with the surge that has worked we're now down to presurge numbers in Iraq.", "That's where we can be.", "We can start putting more troops in Afghanistan as we also work with our NATO allies who are there strengthening us and we need to grow our military.", "We cannot afford to lose against al Qaeda and the Shia extremists who are still there, still fighting us, but we're getting closer and closer to victory.", "And it would be a travesty if we quit now in Iraq.", " Gwen, with all due respect, I didn't hear a plan.", "Barack Obama has offered a clear plan.", "Shift responsibility to the Iraqis over the next 16 months.", "Draw down our combat troops.", "Ironically the same plan that Maliki, the prime minister of Iraq and George Bush are now negotiating.", "The only odd man out here, only one left out is John McCain, number one.", "Number two, with regard to Barack Obama not -- quote -- \"funding the troops,\" John McCain voted the exact same way.", "John McCain voted against funding the troops because of an amendment he voted against had a timeline in it to draw down American troops.", "And John said I'm not going to fund the troops if in fact there's a timeline.", "Barack Obama and I agree fully and completely on one thing: You've got to have a time line to draw down the troops and shift responsibility to the Iraqis.We're spending $10 billion a month while the Iraqis have an $80 billion surplus.", "Barack says it's time for them to spend their own money and have the 400,000 military we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve trained for them begin to take their own responsibility and gradually over six months -- 16 months, withdrawal.", "John McCain -- this is a fundamental difference between us, we will end this war.", "For John McCain, there's no end in sight to end this war, fundamental difference.", "We will end this war.", " Your plan is a white flag of surrender in Iraq and that is not what our troops need to hear today, that's for sure.", "And it's not what our nation needs to be able to count on.", "You guys opposed the surge.", "The surge worked.", "Barack Obama still can't admit the surge works.We'll know when we're finished in Iraq when the Iraqi government can govern its people and when the Iraqi security forces can secure its people.", "And our commanders on the ground will tell us when those conditions have been met.", "And Maliki and Talabani also in working with us are knowing again that we are getting closer and closer to that point, that victory that's within sight.", "Now, you said regarding Senator McCain's military policies there, Senator Biden, that you supported a lot of these things.", "In fact, you said in fact that you wanted to run, you'd be honored to run with him on the ticket, and that's an indication I think of some of the support that you had at least until you became the VP pick here.", "You also said that Barack Obama was not ready to be commander in chief.", "And I know again that you opposed the move that he made to try to cut off funding for the troops and I respect you for that.", "I don't know how you can defend that position now, but I know that you know especially with your son in the National Guard and I have great respect for your family also and the honor that you show our military.", "Barack Obama though, another story there.", "Anyone I think who can cut off funding for the troops after promising not to is another story.", " John McCain voted to cut off funding for the troops.", "Let me say that again: John McCain voted against an amendment containing $1 billion, $600 million that I had gotten to get MRAPS, those things that are protecting the governor's son and pray god my son and a lot of other sons and daughters.He voted against it.", "He voted against funding because he said the amendment had a time line in it to end this war, and he didn't like that.", "But let's get straight who has been right and wrong.", "John McCain and Dick Cheney said when I was saying we would not be greeted as liberators, we would not - this war would take a decade, not a day, not a week, not six months, we would not be out of there quickly.", "John McCain was saying the Sunnis and Shias got along with each other without reading the history of the last 700 years.", "John McCain said there would be enough oil to pay for this.", "John McCain has been dead wrong.", "I love him.", "As my mother would say, god love him, but he's been dead wrong on the fundamental issues relating to the conduct of the war.", "Barack Obama has been right.", "There are the facts.", " Well, they're both extremely dangerous.", "I always am focused, as you know Gwen, I have been focusing on for a long time, along with Barack on Pakistan.", "Pakistan already has nuclear weapons.", "Pakistan already has deployed nuclear weapons.", "Pakistan's weapons can already hit Israel and the Mediterranean.", "Iran getting a nuclear weapon would be very, very destabilizing.", "They are more than - they are not close to getting a nuclear weapon that's able to be deployed.", "So they're both very dangerous.", "They both would be game changers.", "But look, here's what the fundamental problem I have with John's policy about terror instability.", "John continues to tell us that the central war in the front on terror is in Iraq.", "I promise you, if an attack comes in the homeland, it's going to come as our security services have said, it is going to come from al Qaeda planning in the hills of Afghanistan and Pakistan.", "That's where they live.", "That's where they are.", "That's where it will come from.", "And right now that resides in Pakistan.", "A stable government needs to be established.", "We need to support that democracy by helping them not only with their military but with their governance as well as their economic well-being.There have been 7,000 madrasses built along that border.", "We should be helping them build schools to compete for those hearts and minds of the people in the region so that we're actually able to take on terrorism.", "And by the way, that's where bin Laden lives and we will go at him if we have actionable intelligence.", " Both are extremely dangerous, of course.", "And as for who termed that central war on terror being in Iraq, it was General Petraeus and al Qaeda, both leaders there and it's probably the only thing that they're ever going to agree on, but that it was a central war on terror is in Iraq.", "You don't have to believe me or John McCain on that.", "I would believe Petraeus and that leader of al Qaeda.An armed, nuclear armed especially, Iran is so extremely dangerous to consider.", "They cannot be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons period.", "Israel is in jeopardy of course when we're dealing with Ahmadinejad as a leader of Iran.", "Iran claiming that Israel is, he termed it, a stinking corpse, a country that should be wiped off the face of the earth.", "Now a leader like Ahmadinejad who is not sane or stable when he says things like that is not one whom we can allow to acquire nuclear energy, nuclear weapons.", "Ahmadinejad, Kim Jong Il, the Castro brothers, others who are dangerous dictators are ones that Barack Obama has said he would be willing to meet with without preconditions being met first.", "An issue like that taken up by a presidential candidate goes beyond naivete and goes beyond poor judgment.", "A statement that he made like that is downright dangerous, because leaders like Ahmadinejad who would seek to acquire nuclear weapons and wipe off the face of the earth an ally like we have in Israel should not be met with without preconditions and diplomatic efforts being undertaken first.", " No, and Dr. Henry Kissinger especially.", "I had a good conversation with him recently.", "And he shared with me also his passion for diplomacy.", "And that's what John McCain and I would engage in also.", "But again, with some of these dictators who hate America and hate what we stand for, with our freedoms, our democracy, our tolerance, our respect for women's rights, those who would try to destroy what we stand for cannot be met with just sitting down on a presidential level as Barack Obama had said he would be willing to do.", "That is beyond bad judgment.", "That is dangerous.No, diplomacy is very important.", "First and foremost, that is what we would engage in.", "But diplomacy is hard work by serious people.", "It's lining out clear objectives and having your friends and your allies ready to back you up there and have sanctions lined up also before any kind of presidential summit would take place.", " Can I clarify this?", "That's just simply not true about Barack Obama.", "He did not say sit down with Ahmadinejad.", " The fact of the matter is, it surprises me that Senator McCain doesn't realize that Ahmadinejad does not control the security apparatus in Iran.", "The theocracy controls the security apparatus, number one.Number two, five secretaries of state did say we should talk with and sit down.", "Now, John and Governor Palin now say they're all for -- they have a passion, I think the phrase was, a passion for diplomacy and that we have to bring our friends and allies along.", "Our friends and allies have been saying, Gwen, \"Sit down.", "Talk.", "Talk.", "Talk.\"", "Our friends and allies have been saying that, five secretaries of state, three of them Republicans.", "And John McCain has said he would go along with an agreement, but he wouldn't sit down.", "Now, how do you do that when you don't have your administration sit down and talk with the adversary?", "And look what President Bush did.", "After five years, he finally sent a high-ranking diplomat to meet with the highest-ranking diplomats in Iran, in Europe, to try to work out an arrangement.", "Our allies are on that same page.", "And if we don't go the extra mile on diplomacy, what makes you think the allies are going to sit with us?", "The last point I'll make, John McCain said as recently as a couple of weeks ago he wouldn't even sit down with the government of Spain, a NATO ally that has troops in Afghanistan with us now.", "I find that incredible.", " Yes.", " A two-state solution is the solution.", "And Secretary Rice, having recently met with leaders on one side or the other there, also, still in these waning days of the Bush administration, trying to forge that peace, and that needs to be done, and that will be top of an agenda item, also, under a McCain-Palin administration.Israel is our strongest and best ally in the Middle East.", "We have got to assure them that we will never allow a second Holocaust, despite, again, warnings from Iran and any other country that would seek to destroy Israel, that that is what they would like to see.", "We will support Israel.", "A two-state solution, building our embassy, also, in Jerusalem, those things that we look forward to being able to accomplish, with this peace-seeking nation, and they have a track record of being able to forge these peace agreements.", "They succeeded with Jordan.", "They succeeded with Egypt.", "I'm sure that we're going to see more success there, also.", "It's got to be a commitment of the United States of America, though.", "And I can promise you, in a McCain-Palin administration, that commitment is there to work with our friends in Israel.", " Gwen, no one in the United States Senate has been a better friend to Israel than Joe Biden.", "I would have never, ever joined this ticket were I not absolutely sure Barack Obama shared my passion.But you asked a question about whether or not this administration's policy had made sense or something to that effect.", "It has been an abject failure, this administration's policy.", "In fairness to Secretary Rice, she's trying to turn it around now in the seventh or eighth year.", "Here's what the president said when we said no.", "He insisted on elections on the West Bank, when I said, and others said, and Barack Obama said, \"Big mistake.", "Hamas will win.", "You'll legitimize them.\"", "What happened?", "Hamas won.", "When we kicked -- along with France, we kicked Hezbollah out of Lebanon, I said and Barack said, \"Move NATO forces in there.", "Fill the vacuum, because if you don't know -- if you don't, Hezbollah will control it.\"", "Now what's happened?", "Hezbollah is a legitimate part of the government in the country immediately to the north of Israel.", "The fact of the matter is, the policy of this administration has been an abject failure.", "And speaking of freedom being on the march, the only thing on the march is Iran.", "It's closer to a bomb.", "Its proxies now have a major stake in Lebanon, as well as in the Gaza Strip with Hamas.", "We will change this policy with thoughtful, real, live diplomacy that understands that you must back Israel in letting them negotiate, support their negotiation, and stand with them, not insist on policies like this administration has.", " Has this administration's policy been an abject failure, as the senator says, Governor?", " No, I do not believe that it has been.", "But I'm so encouraged to know that we both love Israel, and I think that is a good thing to get to agree on, Senator Biden.", "I respect your position on that.No, in fact, when we talk about the Bush administration, there's a time, too, when Americans are going to say, \"Enough is enough with your ticket,\" on constantly looking backwards, and pointing fingers, and doing the blame game.", "There have been huge blunders in the war.", "There have been huge blunders throughout this administration, as there are with every administration.", "But for a ticket that wants to talk about change and looking into the future, there's just too much finger-pointing backwards to ever make us believe that that's where you're going.", "Positive change is coming, though.", "Reform of government is coming.", "We'll learn from the past mistakes in this administration and other administrations.", "And we're going to forge ahead with putting government back on the side of the people and making sure that our country comes first, putting obsessive partisanship aside.", "That's what John McCain has been known for in all these years.", "He has been the maverick.", "He has ruffled feathers.", "But I know, Senator Biden, you have respected him for that, and I respect you for acknowledging that.", "But change is coming.", " Look, past is prologue, Gwen.", "The issue is, how different is John McCain's policy going to be than George Bush's?", "I haven't heard anything yet.I haven't heard how his policy is going to be different on Iran than George Bush's.", "I haven't heard how his policy is going to be different with Israel than George Bush's.", "I haven't heard how his policy in Afghanistan is going to be different than George Bush's.", "I haven't heard how his policy in Pakistan is going to be different than George Bush's.", "It may be.", "But so far, it is the same as George Bush's.", "And you know where that policy has taken us.", "We will make significant change so, once again, we're the most respected nation in the world.", "That's what we're going to do.", " Nuclear weaponry, of course, would be the be all, end all of just too many people in too many parts of our planet, so those dangerous regimes, again, cannot be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons, period.Our nuclear weaponry here in the U.S. is used as a deterrent.", "And that's a safe, stable way to use nuclear weaponry.", "But for those countries -- North Korea, also, under Kim Jong-il -- we have got to make sure that we're putting the economic sanctions on these countries and that we have friends and allies supporting us in this to make sure that leaders like Kim Jong-il and Ahmadinejad are not allowed to acquire, to proliferate, or to use those nuclear weapons.", "It is that important.", "Can we talk about Afghanistan real quick, also, though?", " OK, I'd like to just really quickly mention there, too, that when you look back and you say that the Bush administration's policy on Afghanistan perhaps would be the same as McCain, and that's not accurate.The surge principles, not the exact strategy, but the surge principles that have worked in Iraq need to be implemented in Afghanistan, also.", "And that, perhaps, would be a difference with the Bush administration.", "Now, Barack Obama had said that all we're doing in Afghanistan is air-raiding villages and killing civilians.", "And such a reckless, reckless comment and untrue comment, again, hurts our cause.", "That's not what we're doing there.", "We're fighting terrorists, and we're securing democracy, and we're building schools for children there so that there is opportunity in that country, also.", "There will be a big difference there, and we will win in -- in Afghanistan, also.", " I'll talk about both.", "With Afghanistan, facts matter, Gwen.The fact is that our commanding general in Afghanistan said today that a surge -- the surge principles used in Iraq will not -- well, let me say this again now -- our commanding general in Afghanistan said the surge principle in Iraq will not work in Afghanistan, not Joe Biden, our commanding general in Afghanistan.", "He said we need more troops.", "We need government-building.", "We need to spend more money on the infrastructure in Afghanistan.", "Look, we have spent more money -- we spend more money in three weeks on combat in Iraq than we spent on the entirety of the last seven years that we have been in Afghanistan building that country.", "Let me say that again.", "Three weeks in Iraq; seven years, seven years or six-and-a-half years in Afghanistan.", "Now, that's number one.", "Number two, with regard to arms control and weapons, nuclear weapons require a nuclear arms control regime.", "John McCain voted against a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty that every Republican has supported.", "John McCain has opposed amending the Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty with an amendment to allow for inspections.", "John McCain has not been -- has not been the kind of supporter for dealing with -- and let me put it another way.", "My time is almost up.", "Barack Obama, first thing he did when he came to the United States Senate, new senator, reached across the aisle to my colleague, Dick Lugar, a Republican, and said, \"We've got to do something about keeping nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists.\"", "They put together a piece of legislation that, in fact, was serious and real.", "Every major -- I shouldn't say every -- on the two at least that I named, I know that John McCain has been opposed to extending the arms control regime in the world.", " Well, first, McClellan did not say definitively the surge principles would not work in Afghanistan.", "Certainly, accounting for different conditions in that different country and conditions are certainly different.", "We have NATO allies helping us for one and even the geographic differences are huge but the counterinsurgency principles could work in Afghanistan.", "McClellan didn't say anything opposite of that.", "The counterinsurgency strategy going into Afghanistan, clearing, holding, rebuilding, the civil society and the infrastructure can work in Afghanistan.", "And those leaders who are over there, who have also been advising George Bush on this have not said anything different but that.", " Well, our commanding general did say that.", "The fact of the matter is that again, I'll just put in perspective, while Barack and I and Chuck Hagel and Dick Lugar have been calling for more money to help in Afghanistan, more troops in Afghanistan, John McCain was saying two years ago quote, \"The reason we don't read about Afghanistan anymore in the paper, it's succeeded.Barack Obama was saying we need more troops there.", "Again, we spend in three weeks on combat missions in Iraq, more than we spent in the entire time we have been in Afghanistan.", "That will change in a Barack Obama administration.", " I think the American public has the stomach for success.", "My recommendations on Bosnia.", "I admit I was the first one to recommend it.", "They saved tens of thousands of lives.", "And initially John McCain opposed it along with a lot of other people.", "But the end result was it worked.", "Look what we did in Bosnia.", "We took Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks, being told by everyone, I was told by everyone that this would mean that they had been fighting and killing each other for a thousand years, it would never work.There's a relatively stable government there now as there is in Kosovo.", "With regard to Iraq, I indicated that it would be a mistake to -- I gave the president the power.", "I voted for the power because he said he needed it not to go to war but to keep the United States, the UN in line, to keep sanctions on Iraq and not let them be lifted.", "I, along with Dick Lugar, before we went to war, said if we were to go to war without our allies, without the kind of support we need, we'd be there for a decade and it'd cost us tens of billions of dollars.", "John McCain said, no, it was going to be OK.", "I don't have the stomach for genocide when it comes to Darfur.", "We can now impose a no-fly zone.", "It's within our capacity.", "We can lead NATO if we're willing to take a hard stand.", "We can, I've been in those camps in Chad.", "I've seen the suffering, thousands and tens of thousands have died and are dying.", "We should rally the world to act and we should demonstrate it by our own movement to provide the helicopters to get the 21,000 forces of the African Union in there now to stop this genocide.", " Oh, yeah, it's so obvious I'm a Washington outsider.", "And someone just not used to the way you guys operate.", "Because here you voted for the war and now you oppose the war.", "You're one who says, as so many politicians do, I was for it before I was against it or vice- versa.", "Americans are craving that straight talk and just want to know, hey, if you voted for it, tell us why you voted for it and it was a war resolution.And you had supported John McCain's military strategies pretty adamantly until this race and you had opposed very adamantly Barack Obama's military strategy, including cutting off funding for the troops that attempt all through the primary.", "And I watched those debates, so I remember what those were all about.", "But as for as Darfur, we can agree on that also, the supported of the no-fly zone, making sure that all options are on the table there also.", "America is in a position to help.", "What I've done in my position to help, as the governor of a state that's pretty rich in natural resources, we have a $40 billion investment fund, a savings fund called the Alaska Permanent Fund.", "When I and others in the legislature found out we had some millions of dollars in Sudan, we called for divestment through legislation of those dollars to make sure we weren't doing anything that would be seen as condoning the activities there in Darfur.", "That legislation hasn't passed yet but it needs to because all of us, as individuals, and as humanitarians and as elected officials should do all we can to end those atrocities in that region of the world.", " Absolutely.", "There is a line that should be drawn.", " The line that should be drawn is whether we A, first of all have the capacity to do anything about it number one.", "And number two, there are certain new lines that have to be drawn internationally.", "When a country engages in genocide, when a country engaging in harboring terrorists and will do nothing about it, at that point that country in my view and Barack's view forfeits their right to say you have no right to intervene at all.The truth of the matter is, though, let's go back to John McCain's strategy.", "I never supported John McCain's strategy on the war.", "John McCain said exactly what Dick Cheney said, go back and look at Barack Obama's statements and mine.", "Go look at joebiden.com, contemporaneously, held hearings in the summer before we went to war, saying if we went to war, we would not be greeted as liberator, we would have a fight between Sunnis and Shias, we would be tied down for a decade and cost us hundreds of billions of dollars.", "John McCain was saying the exact opposite.", "John McCain was lock- step with Dick Cheney at that point how this was going to be easy.", "So John McCain's strategy in this war, not just whether or not to go, the actual conduct of the war has been absolutely wrong from the outset.", " I beg to disagree with you, again, here on whether you supported Barack Obama or John McCain's strategies.", "Here again, you can say what you want to say a month out before people are asked to vote on this, but we listened to the debates.I think tomorrow morning, the pundits are going to start do the who said what at what time and we'll have proof of some of this, but, again, John McCain who knows how to win a war.", "Who's been there and he's faced challenges and he knows what evil is and knows what it takes to overcome the challenges here with our military.", "He knows to learn from the mistakes and blunders we have seen in the war in Iraq, especially.", "He will know how to implement the strategies, working with our commanders and listening to what they have to say, taking the politics out of these war issues.", "He'll know how to win a war.", " God forbid that would ever happen, it would be a national tragedy of historic proportions if it were to happen.But if it did, I would carry out Barack Obama's policies, his policies of reinstating the middle class, making sure they get a fair break, making sure they have access to affordable health insurance, making sure they get serious tax breaks, making sure we can help their children get to college, making sure there is an energy policy that leads us in the direction of not only toward independence and clean environment but an energy policy that creates 5 million new jobs, a foreign policy that ends this war in Iraq, a foreign policy that goes after the one mission the American public gave the president after 9/11, to get and capture or kill bin Laden and to eliminate al Qaeda.", "A policy that would in fact engage our allies in making sure that we knew we were acting on the same page and not dictating.", "And a policy that would reject the Bush Doctrine of preemption and regime change and replace it with a doctrine of prevention and cooperation and, ladies and gentlemen, this is the biggest ticket item that we have in this election.", "This is the most important election you will ever, ever have voted in, any of you, since 1932.", "And there's such stark differences, I would follow through on Barack's policies because in essence, I agree with every major initiative he is suggesting.", " And heaven forbid, yes, that would ever happen, no matter how this ends up, that that would ever happen with either party.As for disagreeing with John McCain and how our administration would work, what do you expect?", "A team of mavericks, of course we're not going to agree on 100 percent of everything.", "As we discuss ANWR there, at least we can agree to disagree on that one.", "I will keep pushing him on ANWR.", "I have so appreciated he has never asked me to check my opinions at the door and he wants a deliberative debate and healthy debate so we can make good policy.", "What I would do also, if that were to ever happen, though, is to continue the good work he is so committed to of putting government back on the side of the people and get rid of the greed and corruption on Wall Street and in Washington.", "I think we need a little bit of reality from Wasilla Main Street there, brought to Washington, DC.", " So that people there can understand how the average working class family is viewing bureaucracy in the federal government and Congress, and the inaction of Congress.Just everyday, working-class Americans saying, you know, government, just get out of my way.", "If you're going to do any harm and mandate more things on me and take more of my money and income tax and business taxes, you're going to have a choice in just a few weeks here on either supporting a ticket that wants to create jobs and bolster our economy and win the war or you're going to be supporting a ticket that wants to increase taxes, which ultimately kills jobs, and is going to hurt our economy.", " Can I respond?", "Look, all you've got to do is go down Union Street with me in Wilmington or go to Katie's Restaurant or walk into Home Depot with me where I spend a lot of time and you ask anybody in there whether or not the economic and foreign policy of this administration has made them better off in the last eight years.", "And then ask them whether there's a single major initiative that John McCain differs with the president on.", "On taxes, on Iraq, on Afghanistan, on the whole question of how to help education, on the dealing with health care.Look, the people in my neighborhood, they get it.", "They get it.", "They know they've been getting the short end of the stick.", "So walk with me in my neighborhood, go back to my old neighborhood in Claymont, an old steel town or go up to Scranton with me.", "These people know the middle class has gotten the short end.", "The wealthy have done very well.", "Corporate America has been rewarded.", "It's time we change it.", "Barack Obama will change it.", " Say it ain't so, Joe, there you go again pointing backwards again.", "You prefaced your whole comment with the Bush administration.", "Now doggone it, let's look ahead and tell Americans what we have to plan to do for them in the future.", "You mentioned education and I'm glad that you did.", "I know education you are passionate about with your wife being a teacher for 30 years, and god bless her.", "Her reward is in heaven, right?", "I say, too, with education, America needs to be putting a lot more focus on that and our schools have got to be really ramped up in terms of the funding that they are deserving.", "Teachers needed to be paid more.", "I come from a house full of school teachers.", "My grandma was, my dad who is in the audience today, he's a schoolteacher, had been for many years.", "My brother, who I think is the best schoolteacher in the year, and here's a shout-out to all those third graders at Gladys Wood Elementary School, you get extra credit for watching this debate.Education in America has been in some sense in some of our states just accepted to be a little bit lax, and we have got to increase the standards.", "No Child Left Behind was implemented.", "It's not doing the job though.", "We need flexibility in No Child Left Behind.", "We need to put more of an emphasis on the profession of teaching.", "We need to make sure that education in either one of our agendas, I think, absolute top of the line.", "My kids as public school participants right now, it's near and dear to my heart.", "I'm very, very concerned about where we're going with education and we have got to ramp it up and put more attention in that arena.", " In my comment there, it was a lame attempt at a joke and yours was a lame attempt at a joke, too, I guess, because nobody got it.", "Of course we know what a vice president does.", " They didn't get yours or mine?", "Which one didn't they get?", " No, no.", "Of course, we know what a vice president does.", "And that's not only to preside over the Senate and will take that position very seriously also.", "I'm thankful that the Constitution would allow a bit more authority given to the vice president also if that vice president so chose to exert it in working with the Senate and making sure that we are supportive of the president's policies and making sure too that our president understands what our strengths are.", "John McCain and I have had good conversations about where I would lead with his agenda, and that is energy independence in America and reform of government over all, and then working with families of children with special needs.", "That's near and dear to my heart also.", "And in those arenas, John McCain has already tapped me and said, that's where I want you, I want you to lead.", "And I said, I can't wait to get there and go to work with you.", " Gwen, I hope we'll get back to education because I don't know any government program that John is supporting, not early education, more money for it.", "The reason No Child Left Behind was left behind was the money was left behind, we didn't fund it.", "But we can get back to that I assume.With regard to the role of vice president, I had a long talk, as I'm sure the governor did with her principal, in my case with Barack.", "And let me tell you what Barack asked me to do.", "I have a history of getting things done in the United States Senate.", "John McCain would acknowledge that.", "My record shows that on controversial issues.", "I would be the point person for the legislative initiatives in the United States Congress for our administration.", "I would also, when asked if I wanted a portfolio, my response was, no.", "But Barack Obama indicated to me he wanted me with him to help him govern.", "So every major decision he'll be making, I'll be sitting in the room to give him my best advice.", "He's president, not me, I'll give my best advice.", "And one of the things he said early on when he was choosing, he said he picked someone who had an independent judgment and wouldn't be afraid to tell him if he disagreed.", "That is sort of my reputation, as you know.", "So I look forward to working with Barack and playing a very constructive role in his presidency, bringing about the kind of change this country needs.", " Well, our founding fathers were very wise there in allowing through the Constitution much flexibility there in the Office of the Vice President.", "And we will do what is best for the American people in tapping into that position and ushering in an agenda that is supportive and cooperative with the president's agenda in that position.", "Yeah, so I do agree with him that we have a lot of flexibility in there, and we'll do what we have to do to administer very appropriately the plans that are needed for this nation.And it is my executive experience that is partly to be attributed to my pick as V.P.", "with McCain, not only as a governor, but earlier on as a mayor, as an oil and gas regulator, as a business owner.", "It is those years of experience on an executive level that will be put to good use in the White House also.", " Vice President Cheney has been the most dangerous vice president we've had probably in American history.", "The idea he doesn't realize that Article I of the Constitution defines the role of the vice president of the United States, that's the Executive Branch.", "He works in the Executive Branch.", "He should understand that.", "Everyone should understand that.And the primary role of the vice president of the United States of America is to support the president of the United States of America, give that president his or her best judgment when sought, and as vice president, to preside over the Senate, only in a time when in fact there's a tie vote.", "The Constitution is explicit.", "The only authority the vice president has from the legislative standpoint is the vote, only when there is a tie vote.", "He has no authority relative to the Congress.", "The idea he's part of the Legislative Branch is a bizarre notion invented by Cheney to aggrandize the power of a unitary executive and look where it has gotten us.", "It has been very dangerous.", " My experience as an executive will be put to good use as a mayor and business owner and oil and gas regulator and then as governor of a huge state, a huge energy-producing state that is accounting for much progress towards getting our nation energy independence and that's extremely important.But it wasn't just that experience tapped into, it was my connection to the heartland of America.", "Being a mom, being one who is very concerned about a son in the war, about a special needs child, about kids heading off to college, how are we going to pay those tuition bills?", "About times and Todd and our marriage in our past where we didn't have health insurance and we know what other Americans are going through as they sit around the kitchen table and try to figure out, how are they going to pay out-of-pocket for health care?", "We've been there also so that connection was important.", "But even more important is that worldview that I share with John McCain.", "That worldview that says that America is a nation of exceptionalism.", "And we are to be that shining city on a hill, as President Reagan so beautifully said, that we are a beacon of hope and that we are unapologetic here.", "We are not perfect as a nation.", "But together, we represent a perfect ideal, and that is democracy and tolerance and freedom and equal rights.", "Those things that we stand for that can be put to good use as a force for good in this world.", "John McCain and I share that, and you combine all that with being a team with the only track record of making a really, a difference in where we've been and reforming, and that's a good team, it's a good ticket.", " You're very kind suggesting my only Achilles heel is my lack of discipline.", " Others talk about my excessive passion.", "I'm not going to change.", "I have 35 years in public office.", "People can judge who I am.", "I haven't changed in that time.And, by the way, a record of change -- I will place my record and Barack's record against John McCain's or anyone else in terms of fundamental accomplishments.", "Wrote the crime bill, put 100,000 cops on the street, wrote the Violence Against Women Act, which John McCain voted against both of them, was the catalyst to change the circumstance in Bosnia, led by President Clinton, obviously.", "Look, I understand what it's like to be a single parent.", "When my wife and daughter died and my two sons were gravely injured, I understand what it's like as a parent to wonder what it's like if your kid's going to make it.", "I understand what it's like to sit around the kitchen table with a father who says, \"I've got to leave, champ, because there's no jobs here.", "I got to head down to Wilmington.", "And when we get enough money, honey, we'll bring you down.\"", "I understand what it's like.", "I'm much better off than almost all Americans now.", "I get a good salary with the United States Senate.", "I live in a beautiful house that's my total investment that I have.", "So I -- I am much better off now.", "But the notion that somehow, because I'm a man, I don't know what it's like to raise two kids alone, I don't know what it's like to have a child you're not sure is going to -- is going to make it -- I understand.", "I understand, as well as, with all due respect, the governor or anybody else, what it's like for those people sitting around that kitchen table.", "And guess what?", "They're looking for help.", "They're looking for help.", "They're not looking for more of the same.", " People aren't looking for more of the same.", "They are looking for change.", "And John McCain has been the consummate maverick in the Senate over all these years.He's taken shots left and right from the other party and from within his own party, because he's had to take on his own party when the time was right, when he recognized it was time to put partisanship aside and just do what was right for the American people.", "That's what I've done as governor, also, take on my own party, when I had to, and work with both sides of the aisle, in my cabinet, appointing those who would serve regardless of party, Democrats, independents, Republicans, whatever it took to get the job done.", "Also, John McCain's maverick position that he's in, that's really prompt up to and indicated by the supporters that he has.", "Look at Lieberman, and Giuliani, and Romney, and Lingle, and all of us who come from such a diverse background of -- of policy and of partisanship, all coming together at this time, recognizing he is the man that we need to leave -- lead in these next four years, because these are tumultuous times.", "We have got to win the wars.", "We have got to get our economy back on track.", "We have got to not allow the greed and corruption on Wall Street anymore.", "And we have not got to allow the partisanship that has really been entrenched in Washington, D.C., no matter who's been in charge.", "When the Republicans were in charge, I didn't see a lot of progress there, either.", "When the Democrats, either, though, this last go- around for the last two years.", "Change is coming.", "And John McCain is the leader of that reform.", " I'll be very brief.", "Can I respond to that?Look, the maverick -- let's talk about the maverick John McCain is.", "And, again, I love him.", "He's been a maverick on some issues, but he has been no maverick on the things that matter to people's lives.", "He voted four out of five times for George Bush's budget, which put us a half a trillion dollars in debt this year and over $3 trillion in debt since he's got there.", "He has not been a maverick in providing health care for people.", "He has voted against -- he voted including another 3.6 million children in coverage of the existing health care plan, when he voted in the United States Senate.", "He's not been a maverick when it comes to education.", "He has not supported tax cuts and significant changes for people being able to send their kids to college.", "He's not been a maverick on the war.", "He's not been a maverick on virtually anything that genuinely affects the things that people really talk about around their kitchen table.", "Can we send -- can we get Mom's MRI?", "Can we send Mary back to school next semester?", "We can't -- we can't make it.", "How are we going to heat the -- heat the house this winter?", "He voted against even providing for what they call LIHEAP, for assistance to people, with oil prices going through the roof in the winter.", "So maverick he is not on the important, critical issues that affect people at that kitchen table.", " Yes, I can.", "When I got to the United States Senate and went on the Judiciary Committee as a young lawyer, I was of the view and had been trained in the view that the only thing that mattered was whether or not a nominee appointed, suggested by the president had a judicial temperament, had not committed a crime of moral turpitude, and was -- had been a good student.And it didn't take me long -- it was hard to change, but it didn't take me long, but it took about five years for me to realize that the ideology of that judge makes a big difference.", "That's why I led the fight against Judge Bork.", "Had he been on the court, I suspect there would be a lot of changes that I don't like and the American people wouldn't like, including everything from Roe v. Wade to issues relating to civil rights and civil liberties.", "And so that -- that -- that was one of the intellectual changes that took place in my career as I got a close look at it.", "And that's why I was the first chairman of the Judiciary Committee to forthrightly state that it matters what your judicial philosophy is.", "The American people have a right to understand it and to know it.", "But I did change on that, and -- and I'm glad I did.", " There have been times where, as mayor and governor, we have passed budgets that I did not veto and that I think could be considered as something that I quasi-caved in, if you will, but knowing that it was the right thing to do in order to progress the agenda for that year and to work with the legislative body, that body that actually holds the purse strings.So there were times when I wanted to zero-base budget, and to cut taxes even more, and I didn't have enough support in order to accomplish that.", "But on the major principle things, no, there hasn't been something that I've had to compromise on, because we've always seemed to find a way to work together.", "Up there in Alaska, what we have done is, with bipartisan efforts, is work together and, again, not caring who gets the credit for what, as we accomplish things up there.", "And that's been just a part of the operation that I wanted to participate in.", "And that's what we're going to do in Washington, D.C., also, bring in both sides together.", "John McCain is known for doing that, also, in order to get the work done for the American people.", " Well, again, I believe John McCain, were he here -- and this is a dangerous thing to say in the middle of an election -- but he would acknowledge what I'm about to say.I have been able to work across the aisle on some of the most controversial issues and change my party's mind, as well as Republicans', because I learned a lesson from Mike Mansfield.", "Mike Mansfield, a former leader of the Senate, said to me one day -- he -- I made a criticism of Jesse Helms.", "He said, \"What would you do if I told you Jesse Helms and Dot Helms had adopted a child who had braces and was in real need?\"", "I said, \"I'd feel like a jerk.\"", "He said, \"Joe, understand one thing.", "Everyone's sent here for a reason, because there's something in them that their folks like.", "Don't question their motive.\"", "I have never since that moment in my first year questioned the motive of another member of the Congress or Senate with whom I've disagreed.", "I've questioned their judgment.", "I think that's why I have the respect I have and have been able to work as well as I've been able to have worked in the United States Senate.", "That's the fundamental change Barack Obama and I will be bring to this party, not questioning other people's motives.", " You do what I did as governor, and you appoint people regardless of party affiliation, Democrats, independents, Republicans.", "You -- you walk the walk; you don't just talk the talk.And even in my own family, it's a very diverse family.", "And we have folks of all political persuasion in there, also, so I've grown up just knowing that, you know, at the end of the day, as long as we're all working together for the greater good, it's going to be OK.", "But the policies and the proposals have got to speak for themselves, also.", "And, again, voters on November 4th are going to have that choice to either support a ticket that supports policies that create jobs.", "You do that by lowering taxes on American workers and on our businesses.", "And you build up infrastructure, and you rein in government spending, and you make our -- our nation energy independent.", "Or you support a ticket that supports policies that will kill jobs by increasing taxes.", "And that's what the track record shows, is a desire to increase taxes, increase spending, a trillion-dollar spending proposal that's on the table.", "That's going to hurt our country, and saying no to energy independence.", "Clear choices on November 4th.", " Well, again, Gwen, I do want to thank you and the commission.", "This is such an honor for me.And I appreciate, too, Senator Biden, getting to meet you, finally, also, and getting to debate with you.", "And I would like more opportunity for this.", "I like being able to answer these tough questions without the filter, even, of the mainstream media kind of telling viewers what they've just heard.", "I'd rather be able to just speak to the American people like we just did.", "And it's so important that the American people know of the choices that they have on November 4th.", "I want to assure you that John McCain and I, we're going to fight for America.", "We're going to fight for the middle-class, average, everyday American family like mine.", "I've been there.", "I know what the hurts are.", "I know what the challenges are.", "And, thank God, I know what the joys are, too, of living in America.", "We are so blessed.", "And I've always been proud to be an American.", "And so has John McCain.", "We have to fight for our freedoms, also, economic and our national security freedoms.", "It was Ronald Reagan who said that freedom is always just one generation away from extinction.", "We don't pass it to our children in the bloodstream; we have to fight for it and protect it, and then hand it to them so that they shall do the same, or we're going to find ourselves spending our sunset years telling our children and our children's children about a time in America, back in the day, when men and women were free.", "We will fight for it, and there is only one man in this race who has really ever fought for you, and that's Senator John McCain.", " Gwen, thank you for doing this, and the commission, and Governor, it really was a pleasure getting to meet you.Look, folks, this is the most important election you've ever voted in your entire life.", "No one can deny that the last eight years, we've been dug into a very deep hole here at home with regard to our economy, and abroad in terms of our credibility.", "And there's a need for fundamental change in our economic philosophy, as well as our foreign policy.", "And Barack Obama and I don't measure progress toward that change based on whether or not we cut more regulations and how well CEOs are doing, or giving another $4 billion in tax breaks to the Exxon Mobils of the world.", "We measure progress in America based on whether or not someone can pay their mortgage, whether or not they can send their kid to college, whether or not they're able to, when they send their child, like we have abroad -- or I'm about to, abroad -- and John has as well, I might add -- to fight, that they are the best equipped and they have everything they need.", "And when they come home, they're guaranteed that they have the best health care and the best education possible.", "You know, in the neighborhood I grew up in, it was all about dignity and respect.", "A neighborhood like most of you grew up in.", "And in that neighborhood, it was filled with women and men, mothers and fathers who taught their children if they believed in themselves, if they were honest, if they worked hard, if they loved their country, they could accomplish anything.", "We believed it, and we did.", "That's why Barack Obama and I are running, to re-establish that certitude in our neighborhoods.", "Ladies and gentlemen, my dad used to have an expression.", "He'd say, \"champ, when you get knocked down, get up.\"", "Well, it's time for America to get up together.", "America's ready, you're ready, I'm ready, and Barack Obama is ready to be the next president of the United States of America.", "May God bless all of you, and most of all, for both of us, selfishly, may God protect our troops.", " Well first of all, I don't agree with Senator Kennedy that Cuba is lost and certainly China was lost when this Administration came into power in 1953.", "As I look at Cuba today, I believe that we are following the right course, a course which is difficult but a course which under the circumstance is the only proper one which will see that the Cuban people get a chance to realize their aspirations of progress through freedom and that they get that with our cooperation with the other organi- of the states in the Organization of American States.", "Now Senator Kennedy has made some very strong criticisms of my part - or alleged part - in what has happened in Cuba.", "He points to the fact that I visited Cuba while Mr. Batista was in power there.", "I can only point out that if we are going to judge the Administrations in terms of our attitude toward dictators, we're glad to have a comparison with the previous administration.", "There were eleven dictators in South America and in Central America when we came in, in 1953.", "Today there are only three left including the one in Cuba.", "We think that's pretty good progress.", "Senator Kennedy also indicated with regard to Cuba that he thought that I had made a mistake when I was in Cuba in not calling for free elections in that country.", "Now I'm very surprised that Senator Kennedy, who is on the Foreign Relations Committee, would have made such a statement as this kind.", "As a matter of fact in his book, The Strategy for Peace, he took the right position.", "And that position is that the United States has a treaty - a treaty with all of the Organization of American States - which prohibits us from interfering in the internal affairs of any other state and prohibits them as well.", "For me to have made such a statement would been in direct uh - opposition to that treaty.", "Now with regard to Cuba, let me make one thing clear.", "There isn't any question but that we will defend our rights there.", "There isn't any question but that we will defend Guantanamo if it's attacked.", "There also isn't any question but that the free people of Cuba - the people who want to be free - are going to be supported and that they will attain their freedom.", "No, Cuba is not lost, and I don't think this kind of defeatist talk by Senator Kennedy helps the situation one bit.", " In the first place I've never suggested that Cuba was lost except for the present.", "In my speech last night I indicated that I thought that Cuba one day again would be free.", "Where I've been critical of the Administration's policy, and where I criticized Mr. Nixon, was because in his press conference in Havana in 1955, he praised the competence and stability of the bicta- bict- Batista dictatorship - that dictatorship had killed over twenty thousand Cubans in seven years.", "Secondly, I did not criticize him for not calling for free elections.", "What I criticized was the failure of the Administration to use its great influence to persuade the Cuban government to hold free elections, particularly in 1957 and 1958.", "Thirdly, Arthur Gardner, a Republican Ambassador, Earl Smith, a Republican Ambassador, in succession - both have indicated in the past six weeks that they reported to Washington that Castro was a Marxist, that Raul Castro was a Communist, and that they got no effective results.", "Instead our aid continued to Batista, which was ineffective; we never were on the side of freedom; we never used our influence when we could have used it most effectively - and today Cuba is lost for freedom.", "I hope some day it will rise; but I don't think it will rise if we continue the same policies toward Cuba that we did in recent years, and in fact towards all of Latin America - when we've almost ignored the needs of Latin America; we've beamed not a single Voice of America program in Spanish to all of Latin America in the last eight years, except for the three months of the Hungarian uh - revolution.", " Mr. Morgan, I suggested that if the United States felt that it could save the summit conference that it would have been proper for us to have expressed regrets.", "In my judgment that statement has been distorted uh - by Mr. Nixon and others in their debates around the country and in their discussions.", "Mr. Lodge, on \"Meet the Press\" a month ago, said if there was ever a case when we did not have law an our side it was in the U-2 incident.", "The U-2 flights were proper from the point of view of protecting our security.", "But they were not in accordance with international law.", "And I said that I felt that rather than tell the lie which we told, rather than indicate that the flights would continue - in fact, I believe Mr. Nixon himself said on May fifteenth that the flights would continue even though Mr. Herter testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that they had been canceled as of May twelfth - that it would have been far better that if we had expressed regrets, if that would have saved the summit, and if the summit is useful - and I believe it is.", "The point that is always left out is the fact that we expressed regrets to Castro this winter; that we expressed regrets - the Eisenhower Administration expressed regrets - for a flight over Southern Russia in 1958.", "We expressed regrets for a flight over Eastern Germany under this Administration.", "The Soviet Union in 1955 expressed regrets to us over the Bering Sea incident.", "The Chinese Communists expressed regrets to us over a plane incident in 1956.", "That is the accepted procedure between nations; and my judgment is that we should follow the advice of Theodore Roosevelt: Be strong; maintain a strong position; but also speak softly.", "I believe that in those cases where international custom calls for the expression of a regret, if that would have kept the summit going, in my judgment it was a proper action.", "It's not appeasement.", "It's not soft.", "I believe we should be stronger than we now are.", "I believe we should have a stronger military force.", "I believe we should increase our strength all over the world.", "But I don't confuse words with strength; and in my judgment if the summit was useful, if it would have brought us closer to peace, that rather than the lie that we told - which has been criticized by all responsible people afterwards - it would have been far better for us to follow the common diplomatic procedure of expressing regrets and then try to move on.", " I think Kenne- Senator Kennedy is wrong on three counts.", "First of all, he's wrong in thinking th- er- even suggesting that Mr. Khrushchev might have continued the conference if we had expressed regrets.", "He knew these flights were going on long before and that wasn't the reason that he broke up the conference.", "Second, he's wrong in the analogies that he makes.", "The United States is a strong country.", "Whenever we do anything that's wrong, we can express regrets.", "But when the president of the United States is doing something that's right, something that is for the purpose of defending the security of this country against surprise attack, he can never express regrets or apologize to anybody, including Mr. Khrushchev.", "Now in that connection Senator Kennedy has criticized the President on the ground not only of not expressing regrets, but because he allowed this flight to take place while the summit conference - or immediately before the summit conference occurred.", "This seems to me is criticism that again is wrong on his part.", "We all remember Pearl Harbor.", "We lost three thousand American lives.", "We cannot afford an intelligence gap.", "And I just want to make my position absolutely clear with regard to getting intelligence information.", "I don't intend to see to it that the United States is ever in a position where, while we're negotiating with the Soviet Union, that we discontinue our intelligence effort.", "And I don't intend ever to express regrets to Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else if I'm doing something that has the support of the Congress and that is right for the purpose of protecting the security of the United States.", " My intentions in the field of civil rights have been spelled out in the Republican platform.", "I think we have to make progress first in the field of employment.", "And there we would give statutory authority to the Committee on Government Contracts, which is an effective way of getting real progress made in this area, since about one out of every four jobs is held by and is allotted by people who have government contracts.", "Certainly I think all of us agree that when anybody has a government contract, certainly the money that is spent under that contract ought to be disbursed equally without regard to the race or creed or color of the individual who is to be employed.", "Second, in the field of schools, we believe that there should be provisions whereby the federal government would give assistance to those districts who do want to integrate their schools.", "That of course was rejected as was the government contracts provision by the special session of the Congress to - in which Mr. Kennedy was quite active.", "And then as far as other areas are concerned, I think that we have to look to presidential leadership.", "And when I speak of presidential leadership, I refer for example to our attitude on the sit-in strikes.", "Here we have a situation which causes all of us concern - causes us concern because of the denial of the rights of people to the equality which we think belongs to everybody.", "I have talked to Negro mothers.", "I've heard them explain - try to explain - how they tell their children how they can go into a store and buy a loaf of bread but then can't go into that store and sit at the counter and get a Coca Cola.", "This is wrong, and we have to do something about it.", "So, under the circumstances, what do we do?", "Well what we do is what the Attorney-General of the United States did under the direction of the President: call in the owners of chain stores and get them to take action.", "Now there are other places where the executive can lead, but let me just sum up by saying this: why do I talk every time I'm in the South on civil rights?", "Not because I am preaching to the people of the South because this isn't just a Southern problem; it's a Northern problem and a Western problem; it's a problem for all of us.", "I do it because it's the responsibility of leadership, I do it because we have to solve this problem together.", "I do it right at this time particularly because when we have Khrushchev in this country - a man who has enslaved millions, a man who has slaughtered thousands - we cannot continue to have a situation where he can point the finger at the United States of America and say that we are denying rights to our citizens.", "And so I say both the candidates and both the vice presidential candidates, I would hope as well - including Senator Johnson - should talk on this issue at every opportunity.", " Well, Mr. Nixon hasn't discussed the two basic questions: what is going to be done and what will be his policy on implementing the Supreme Court decision of 1954?", "Giving aid to schools technically that are trying to carry out the decision is not the great question.", "Secondly, what's he going to do to provide fair employment?", "He's been the head of the Committee on Government Contracts that's carried out two cases, both in the District of Columbia.", "He has not indicated his support of an attempt to provide fair employment practices around the country, so that everyone can get a job regardless of their race or color.", "Nor has he indicated that he will support Title Three, which would give the Attorney General additional powers to protect Constitutional rights.", "These are the great questions: equality of education in school.", "About two percent of our population of white people are - is illiterate, ten per cent of our colored population.", "Sixty to seventy percent of our colored children do not finish high school.", "These are the questions in these areas that the North and South, East and West are entitled to know.", "What will be the leadership of the president in these areas to provide equality of opportunity for employment?", "Equality of opportunity in the field of housing, which could be done on all federal supported housing by a stroke of the president's pen.", "What will be done to provide equality of education in all sections of the United States?", "Those are the questions to which the president must establish a moral tone and moral leadership.", "And I can assure you that if I'm elected president we will do so.", " Well let me say that I think that the president operates in a number of different areas.", "First, as a legislative leader.", "And as I just said that I believe that the passage of the so-called Title Three, which gives the Attorney General the power to protect Constitutional rights in those cases where it's not possible for the person involved to bring the suit.", "Secondly, as an executive leader.", "There have been only six cases brought by this Attorney General under the voting bill passed in 1957 and the voting bill passed in 1960.", "The right to vote is basic.", "I do not believe that this Administration has implemented those bills which represent the will of the majority of the Congress on two occasions with vigor.", "Thirdly, I don't believe that the government contracts division is operated with vigor.", "Everyone who does business with the government should have the opportunity to make sure that they do not practice discrimination in their hiring.", "And that's in all sections of the United States.", "And then fourthly, as a moral leader.", "There is a very strong moral basis for this concept of equality of opportunity.", "We are in a very difficult time.", "We need all the talent we can get.", "We sit on a conspicuous stage.", "We are a goldfish bowl before the world.", "We have to practice what we preach.", "We set a very high standard for ourselves.", "The Communists do not.", "They set a low standard of materialism.", "We preach in the Declaration of Independence and in the Constitution, in the statement of our greatest leaders, we preach very high standards; and if we're not going to be s- charged before the world with hypocrisy we have to meet those standards.", "I believe the president of the United States should indicate it.", "Now lastly, I believe in the case of Little Rock.", "I would have hoped that the president of the United States would have been possible for him to indicate it clearly that uh - the Supreme Court decision was going to be carried out.", "I would have hoped that it would have been possible to use marshals to do so.", "But it wou- uh - evidently uh - under the handling of the case it was not.", "I would hope an incident like that would not happen.", "I think if the president is responsible, if he consults with those involved, if he makes it clear that the Supreme Court decision is going to be carried out in a way that the Supreme Court planned - with deliberate speed - then in my judgment, providing he's behind action, I believe we can make uh - progress.", "Now the present Administration - the President - has said - never indicated what he thought of the 1954 decision.", "Unless the president speaks, then of course uh - the country doesn't speak, and Franklin Roosevelt said: \"The pre - uh - the presidency of the United States is above all a place of moral leadership.\"", "And I believe on this great moral issue he should speak out and give his views clearly.", " Senator Kennedy has expressed some hopes in this field, hopes which I think all Americans would share who want some problem - some progress in this area.", "But let's look at the performance.", "When he selected his vice presidential running mate, he selected a man who had voted against most of these proposals and who opposes them at the present time.", "Let me s- look also at what I did.", "I selected a man who stands with me in this field and who will talk with me and work with me on it.", "Now the Senator referred to the Committee on Government Contracts.", "And yet that very committee of which I am chairman has been handicapped by the fact that we have not had adequate funds; we have not had adequate powers; we haven't had an adequate staff.", "Now in the special session of Congress and also in the session that preceded it, the Democratic Congress - in which there's a two-to-one Democratic majority - was asked by the President to give us the funds and give us the power to do a job and they did nothing at all, And in the special session in which Senator Kennedy was calling the signals, along with Senator Johnson, they turned it down and he himself voted against giving us the powers despite the fact that the bill had already been considered before, that it already had hearings on, and the Congress already knew what it had before it.", "All that I can say is this: what we need here are not just high hopes.", "What we need is action.", "And in the field of executive leadership, I can say that I believe it's essential that the president of the United States not only set the tone but he also must lead; he must act as he talks.", " Mr. Morgan, no matter how well we're doing in the cold war, we're not doing as well as we should.", "And that will always be the case as long as the Communists are on the international scene, in the aggressive tac- uh - tendencies that they presently are following.", "Now as far as the present situation is concerned, I think it's time that we nail a few of these distortions about the United States that have been put out.", "First of all, we hear that our prestige is at an all-time low.", "Senator Kennedy has been hitting that point over and over again.", "I would suggest that after Premier Kush- Khrushchev's uh - performance in the United Nations, compared with President Eisenhower's eloquent speech, that at the present time Communist prestige in the world is at an all-time low and American prestige is at an all-time high.", "Now that, of course, is just one factor, but it's a significant one.", "When we look, for example, at the vote on the Congo.", "We were on one side; they were on the other side.", "What happened?", "There were seventy votes for our position and none for theirs.", "Look at the votes in the United Nations over the past seven and a half years.", "That's a test of prestige.", "Every time the United States has been an one side and they've been on the other side, our position has been sustained.", "Now looking to what we ought to do in the future.", "In this cold war we have to recognize where it is being fought and then we have to develop programs to deal with it.", "It's being fought primarily in Asia, in Africa, and in Latin America.", "What do we need?", "What tools do we need to fight us?", "Well we need, for example, economic assistance; we need technical assistance; we need exchange; we need programs of diplomatic and other character which will be effective in that area.", "Now Senator Kennedy a moment ago referred to the fact that there was not an adequate Voice of America program for Latin America.", "I'd like to point out that in the last six years, the Democratic Congresses, of which he'd been a member, have cut twenty million dollars off of the Voice of America programs.", "They also have cut four billion dollars off of mutual security in these last six years.", "They also have cut two billion dollars off of defense.", "Now when they talk about our record here, it is well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well.", "So let me summarize by saying this: I'm not satisfied with what we're doing in the cold war because I believe we have to step up our activities and launch an offensive for the minds and hearts and souls of men.", "It must be economic; it must be technological; above all it must be ideological.", "But we've got to get help from the Congress in order to do this.", " Of course Mr. Nixon is wholly inaccurate when he says that the Congress has not provided more funds in fact than the President recommended for national defense.", "Nineteen fifty-three we tried to put an appropriation of five billion dollars for our defenses.", "I was responsible for the amendment with Senator Monroney in 1954 to strengthen our ground forces.", "The Congress of the United States appropriated six hundred and seventy-seven million dollars mare than the President was willing to use up till a week ago.", "Secondly, on the question of our position in the United Nations.", "We all know about the vote held this week - of the five neutralists - and it was generally regarded as a defeat for the United States.", "Thirdly, in 1952, there were only seven votes in favor of the admission of Red China into the United Nations.", "Last year there were twenty-nine and tomorrow when the preliminary vote is held you will see a strengthening of that position or very closely to it.", "We have not maintained our position and our prestige.", "A Gallup Poll taken in February of this year asking the - in eight out of nine countries - they asked the people, who do they think would be ahead by 1970 militarily and scientifically, and a majority in eight of the nine countries said the Soviet Union would be by 1970.", "Governor Rockefeller has been far more critical in June of our position in the world than I have been.", "The Rockefeller Brothers report, General Ridgway, General Gavin, the Gaither Report, various reports of Congressional committees all indicate that the relative strength of the p- United States both militarily, politically, psychologically, and scientifically and industrially - the relative strength of the so- of United States compared to that of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists together - has deteriorated in the last eight years and we should know it, and the American people should be told the facts.", " Yes.", "We have been wholly indifferent to Latin America until the last few months.", "The program that was put forward this summer, after we broke off the sugar quota with Cuba, really was done because we wanted to get through the O.A.S.", "meeting a condemnation of Russian infiltration of Cuba.", "And therefore we passed an authorization - not an aid bill - which was the first time, really, since the Inter-American Bank which was founded a year ago was developed, that we really have looked at the needs of Latin America; that we have associated ourselves with those people.", "Secondly, I believe that in the ca- that it's far better for the United States, instead of concentrating our aid, particularly in the underdeveloped world, on surplus military equipment - we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into Laos.", "We paid more military aid, more aid into Laos po- per - per person than in any country in the world and we ought to know now that Laos is moving from neutralism in the direction of the Communists.", "I believe instead of doing that, we should concentrate our aid in long-term loans which these people can pay back either in hard money or in local currency.", "This permits them to maintain their self-respect.", "It permits us to make sure that the projects which are invested in are going to produce greater wealth.", "And I believe that in cases of India and Africa and Latin America that this is where our emphasis should be.", "I would strengthen the Development Loan Fund.", "And Senator Fulbright, Senator Humphrey and I tried to do that.", "We tried to provide an appropriation of a billion and a half for five years, on a long-term loan basis, which this Administration opposed.", "And unless we're ready to carry out programs like that in the sixties, this battle for economic survival which these people are waging are going to be lost.", "And if India should lose her battle, with thirty-five per cent of the people of the underdeveloped world within her borders, then I believe that the balance of power could move against us.", "I think the United States can afford to do these things.", "I think that we could not afford not to do these things.", "This goes to our survival.", "And here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if it's developing its economy to the fullest - which we are not now - in my judgment, we'll have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas.", "I believe it's essential that we do it because in the next ten years the balance of power is going to begin to move in the world from one direction or another - towards us or towards the Communists - and unless we begin to identify ourselves not only with the anti-Communist fight, but also with the fight against poverty and hunger, these people are going to begin to turn to the Communists as an example.", "I believe we can do it.", "If we build our economy the way we should, we can afford to do these things and we must do it.", " Senator Kennedy has put a great deal of stress on the necessity for economic assistance.", "This is important.", "But it's also tremendously important to bear in mind that when you pour in money without pouring in technical assistance at w- as well, that you have a disastrous situation.", "We need to step up exchange; we need to step up technical assistance so that trained people in these newly developing countries can operate the economies.", "We also have to have in mind something else with regard to this whole situation in the world, and that is: that as America moves forward, we not only must think in terms of fighting Communism, but we must also think primarily in terms of the interests of these countries.", "We must associate ourselves with their aspirations.", "We must let them know that the great American ideals - of independence, of the right of people to be free, and of the right to progress - that these are ideals that belong not to ourselves alone, but they belong to everybody.", "This we must get across to the world.", "And we can't do it unless we do have adequate funds for, for example, information which has been cut by the Congress, adequate funds for technical assistance.", "The other point that I would make with regard to economic assistance and technical assistance is that the United States must not rest its case here alone.", "This is primarily an ideological battle - a battle for the minds and the hearts and the souls of men.", "We must not meet the Communists purely in the field of gross atheistic materialism.", "We must stand for our ideals.", " To combat unemployment we first must concentrate on the very areas to which you refer - the so-called depressed areas.", "Now in the last Congress - the special session of the Congress - there was a bill: one by the President, one by Senator Kennedy and members of his party.", "Now the bill that the President had submitted would have provided more aid for those areas that really need it - areas like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and the areas of West Virginia - than the ones that Senator Kennedy was supporting.", "On the other hand we found that the bill got into the legislative difficulties and consequently no action was taken.", "So point one, at the highest priority we must get a bill for depressed areas through the next Congress.", "I have made recommendations on that and I have discussed them previously and I will spell them out further in the campaign.", "Second, as we consider this problem of unemployment, we have to realize where it is.", "In analyzing the figures we will find that our unemployment exists among the older citizens; it exists also among those who are inadequately trained; that is, those who do not have an adequate opportunity for education.", "It also exists among minority groups.", "If we're going to combat unemployment, then, we have to do a better job in these areas.", "That's why I have a program for education, a program in the case of equal job opportunities, and one that would also deal with our older citizens.", "Now finally, with regard to the whole problem of combating recession, as you call it, we must use the full resources of the government in these respects: one, we must see to it that credit is expanded as we go into any recessionary period - and understand, I do not believe we're going into a recession.", "I believe this economy is sound and that we're going to move up.", "But second, in addition to that, if we do get into a recessionary period we should move on that part of the economy which is represented by the private sector, and I mean stimulate that part of the economy that can create jobs - the private sector of the economy.", "This means through tax reform and if necessary tax cuts that will stimulate more jobs.", "I favor that rather than massive federal spending programs which will come into effect usually long after you've passed through the recessionary period.", "So we must use all of these weapons for the purpose of combating recession if it should come.", "But I do not expect it to come.", " Well Mr. Nixon has stated the record inaccurately in regard to the depressed area bill.", "I'm very familiar with it.", "It came out of the committee of which I was the chairman - the labor subcommittee - in fifty-five.", "I was the floor manager.", "We passed an area redevelopment bill far more effective than the bill the Administration suggested, on two occasions, and the President vetoed it both times.", "We passed a bill again this year in the cong- in the Senate and it died in the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives.", "Let me make it very clear that the bill that Mr. Nixon talked about did not mention Wilkes-Barre or Scranton; it did not mention West Virginia.", "Our bill was far more effective.", "The bill introduced and erd- sponsored by Senator Douglas was far more effective in trying to stimulate the economy of those areas.", "Secondly, he has mentioned the problem of our older citizens.", "I cannot still understand why this Administration and Mr. Nixon oppose putting medical care for the aged under Social Security to give them some security.", "Third, I believe we should step up the use of our surplus foods in these areas until we're able to get the people back to work.", "Five cents a day - that's what the food package averages per person.", "Fourthly, I believe we should not carry out a hard money, high interest rate policy which helped intensify certainly the recession of 1958, and I think helped bring the slow-down of 1960.", "If we move into a recession in sixty-one, then I would agree that we have to put more money into the economy, and it can be done by either one of the two methods discussed.", "One is by ex- the programs such as aid to education.", "The other would be to make a judgment on what's the most effective tax program to stimulate our economy.", " Well I understood that this was the Eisenhower-Nixon Administration according to all the Republican uh - propaganda that I've read.", "The question is what we're going to do in the future.", "I've been critical of this Administration and I've been critical of the President.", "In fact uh - Mr. Nixon uh - discussed that a week ago in a speech.", "I believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined.", "Now what is the issue is what we're going to do in the future.", "Now that's an issue between Mr. Nixon and myself.", "He feels that we're moving ahead uh - in a - we're not going into a recession in this country, economically; he feels that our power and prestige is stronger than it ever was relative to that of the Communists, that we're moving ahead.", "I disagree.", "And I believe the American people have to make the choice on November eighth between the view of whether we have to move ahead faster, whether what we're doing now is not satisfactory, whether we have to build greater strength at home and abroad and Mr. Nixon's view.", "That's the great issue.", "President Eisenhower moves from the scene on January twentieth and the next four years are the critical years.", "And that's the debate.", "That's the argument between Mr. Nixon and myself and on that issue the American people have to make their judgment and I think it's a important judgment.", "I think in many ways this election is more important than any since 1932, or certainly almost any in this century.", "Because we disagree very fundamentally on the position of the United States, and if his view prevails then I think that's going to bring an important result to this country in the sixties.", "If our view prevails that we have to do more, that we have to make a greater national and international effort, that we have lost prestige in Latin America - the President of Brazil - the new incumbent running for office called on Castro during his campaign because he thought it was important to get the vote of those who were supporting Castro in Latin America.", "In Africa, the United States has ignored Latin uh - Africa.", "We gave more scholarships to the Congo - this summer we offered them - than we've given to all of Africa the year before.", "Less than two hundred for all the countries of Africa and they need trained leadership more than anything.", "We've been uh - having a very clear decision in the last eight years.", "Mr. Nixon has been part of that Administration.", "He's had experience in it.", "And I believe this Administration has not met its responsibilities in the last eight years, that our power relative to that of the Communists is declining, that we're facing a very hazardous time in the sixties, and unless the United States begin to move here - unless we start to go ahead - I don't believe that we're going to meet our responsibility to our own people or to the cause of freedom.", "I think the choice is clear and it involves the future.", " Well first of all, I think Senator Kennedy should make up his mind with regard to my responsibility.", "In our first debate he indicated that I had not had experience or at least uh - had not participated significantly in the making of the decisions.", "I'm glad to hear tonight that he does suggest that I have had some experience.", "Let me make my position cl ear.", "I have participated in the discussions leading to the decisions in this Administration.", "I'm proud of the record of this Administration.", "I don't stand on it because it isn't something to stand on but something to build on.", "Now looking at Senator Kennedy's credentials: he is suggesting that he will move America faster and further than I will.", "But what does he offer?", "He offers retreads of programs that failed.", "I submit to you that as you look at his programs, his program for example with regard to the Federal Reserve and uh - free money or loose money uh - high - low interest rates, his program in the economic field generally are the programs that were adopted and tried during the Truman Administration.", "And when we compare the economic progress of this country in the Truman Administration with that of the Eisenhower Administration, we find that in every index there has been a tr- great deal more performance and more progress in this Administration than in that one.", "I say the programs and the leadership that failed then is not the program and the leadership that America needs now.", "I say that the American people don't want to go back to those policies.", "And incidentally if Senator Kennedy disagrees, he should indicate where he believes those policies are different from those he's advocating today.", " No, of course I haven't talked to Prime Minister Macmillan.", "It would not be appropriate for me to do so.", "The President is still going to be president for the next four months and he, of course, is the only one who could commit this country in this period.", "As far as a summit conference is concerned, I want to make my position absolutely clear.", "I would be willing as president to meet with Mr. Khrushchev or any other world leader if it would serve the cause of peace.", "I would not be able wou- would be willing to meet with him however, unless there were preparations for that conference which would give us some reasonable certainty - some reasonable certainty - that you were going to have some success.", "We must not build up the hopes of the world and then dash them as was the case in Paris.", "There, Mr. Khrushchev came to that conference determined to break it up.", "He was going to break it up because he would - knew that he wasn't going to get his way on Berlin and on the other key matters with which he was concerned at the Paris Conference.", "Now, if we're going to have another summit conference, there must be negotiations at the diplomatic level - the ambassadors, the Secretaries of State, and others at that level - prior to that time, which will delineate the issues and which will prepare the way for the heads of state to meet and make some progress.", "Otherwise, if we find the heads of state meeting and not making progress, we will find that the cause of peace will have been hurt rather than helped.", "So under these circumstances, I, therefore, strongly urge and I will strongly hold, if I have the opportunity to urge or to hold - this position: that any summit conference would be gone into only after the most careful preparation and only after Mr. Khrushchev - after his disgraceful conduct at Paris, after his disgraceful conduct at the United Nations - gave some assurance that he really wanted to sit down and talk and to accomplish something and not just to make propaganda.", " I have no disagreement with the Vice President's position on that.", "It - my view is the same as his.", "Let me say there is only one uh - point I would add.", "That before we go into the summit, before we ever meet again, I think it's important that the United States build its strength; that it build its military strength as well as its own economic strength.", "If we negotiate from a position where the power balance or wave is moving away from us, it's extremely difficult to reach a successful decision on Berlin as well as the other questions.", "Now the next president of the United States in his first year is going to be confronted with a very serious question on our defense of Berlin, our commitment to Berlin.", "It's going to be a test of our nerve and will.", "It's going to be a test of our strength.", "And because we're going to move in sixty-one and two, partly because we have not maintained our strength with sufficient vigor in the last years, I believe that before we meet that crisis, that the next president of the United States should send a message to Congress asking for a revitalization of our military strength, because come spring or late in the winter we're going to be face to face with the most serious Berlin crisis since l949 or fifty.", "On the question of the summit, I agree with the position of Mr. Nixon.", "I would not meet Mr. Khrushchev unless there were some agreements at the secondary level - foreign ministers or ambassadors - which would indicate that the meeting would have some hope of success, or a useful exchange of ideas.", " That's right.", " Well I don't think that in the winter of sixty-one under present economic conditions, it uh - a - uh - tax uh - increase would be desirable.", "In fact, it would be deflationary; it would cause great unemployment; it would cause a real slowdown in our economy.", "If it ever becomes necessary, and is wise economically and essential to our security, I would have no hesitancy in suggesting a tax increase or any other policy which would defend the United States.", "I have talked in every speech about the fact that these are going to be very difficult times in the nineteen-sixties and that we're going to have to meet our responsibilities as citizens.", "I'm talking about a national mood.", "I'm talking about our willingness to bear any burdens in order to maintain our own freedom and in order to meet our freedom around the globe.", "We don't know what the future's going to bring.", "But I would not want anyone to elect me uh - president of the United States - or vote for me - under the expectation that life would be easier if I were elected.", "Now, many of the programs that I'm talking about - economic growth, care for the aged, development of our natural resources - build the strength of the United States.", "That's how the United States began to prepare for its great actions in World War II and in the post-war period.", "If we're moving ahead, if we're providing a viable economy, if our people have sufficient resources so that they can consume what we produce; then this country's on the move, then we're stronger, then we set a better example to the world.", "So we have the problem of not only building our own uh - military strength and extending uh - our policies abroad, we have to do a job here at home.", "So I believe that the policies that I recommend came under the general heading of strengthening the United States.", "We're using our steel capacity fifty-five per cent today.", "We're not able to consume what we're able to produce at a time when the Soviet Union is making great economic gains.", "And all I say is, I don't know what the sixties will bring - except I think they will bring hard times in the uh - international sphere; I hope we can move ahead here at home in the United States; I'm confident we can do a far better job of mobilizing our economy and resources in the United States.", "And I merely say that they - if they elect me president, I will do my best to carry the United States through a difficult period; but I would not want people to elect me because I promised them the easy, soft life.", "I think it's going to be difficult; but I'm confident that this country can meet its responsibilities.", " Well I think we should be no - under no illusions whatever about what the responsibilities of the American people will be in the sixties.", "Our expenditures for defense, our expenditures for mutual security, our expenditures for economic assistance and technical assistance are not going to get less.", "In my opinion they're going to be de- be greater.", "I think it may be necessary that we have more taxes.", "I hope not.", "I hope we can economize elsewhere so that we don't have to.", "But I would have no hesitation to ask the American people to pay the taxes even in l961 - if necessary - to maintain a sound economy and also to maintain a sound dollar.", "Because when you do not tax, and tax enough to pay for your outgo, you pay it many times over in higher prices and inflation; and I simply will not do that.", "I think I should also add that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, if he intends to carry out his platform - the one adopted in Los Angeles - it is just impossible for him to make good on those promises without raising taxes or without having a rise in t- prices or both.", "The platform suggests that it can be done through economic growth; that it can be done, in effect, with mirrors.", "But it isn't going to be working that way.", "You can't add billions of dollars to our expenditures and not pay for it.", "After all, it isn't paid for by my money, it isn't paid for by his, but by the people's money.", " I did.", "And as I pointed out in 1952, I made it very clear that as far as the Korean War was concerned, that I felt that the decision to go into the war in Korea was right and necessary.", "What I criticized were the policies that made it necessary to go to Korea.", "Now incidentally, I should point out here that Senator Kennedy has attacked our foreign policy.", "He's said that it's been a policy that has led to defeat and retreat.", "And I'd like to know where have we been defeated and where have we retreated?", "In the Truman Administration, six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain including the satellite countries of Eastern Europe and Communist China.", "In this Administration we've stopped them at Quemoy and Matsu; we've stopped them in Indochina; we've stopped them in Lebanon; we've stopped them in other parts of the world.", "I would also like to point out that as far as Senator Kennedy's comments are concerned, I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks we're wrong.", "But he has a responsibility to be accurate, and not to misstate the case.", "I don't think he should say that our prestige is at an all-time low.", "I think this is very harmful at a time Mr. Khrushchev is here - harmful because it's wrong.", "I don't think it was helpful when he suggested - and I'm glad he's corrected this to an extent - that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night in the United States.", "Now this just wasn't true.", "Now, there are people who go to bed hungry in the United States - far less, incidentally, than used to go to bed hungry when we came into power at the end of the Truman Administration.", "But the thing that is right about the United States, it should be emphasized, is that less people go to bed hungry in the United States than in any major country in the world.", "We're the best fed; we're the best clothed, with a better distribution of this world's goods to all of our people than any people in history.", "Now, in pointing out the things that are wrong, I think we ought to emphasize America's strengths.", "It isn't necessary to - to run America down in order to build her up.", "Now so that we get it absolutely clear: Senator Kennedy must as a candidate - as I as a candidate in fifty-two - criticize us when we're wrong.", "And he's doing a very effective job of that, in his way.", "But on the other hand, he has a responsibility to be accurate.", "And I have a responsibility to correct him every time he misstates the case; and I intend to continue to do so.", " Well, Mr. Nixon uh- I'll just give you the testimony of Mr. George Aiken - Senator George Aiken, the ranking minority member - Republican member - and former chairman of the Senate Agricultural Committee testifying in 1959 - said there were twenty-six million Americans who did not have the income to afford a decent diet.", "Mr. Benson, testifying on the food stamp plan in 1957, said there were twenty-five million Americans who could not afford a elementary low-cost diet.", "And he defined that as someone who uses beans in place of meat.", "Now I've seen a good many hundreds of thousands of people who are uh - not adequately fed.", "You can't tell me that a surplus food distribution of five cents po- per person - and that n- nearly six million Americans receiving that - is adequate.", "You can't tell me that any one who uses beans instead of meat in the United States - and there are twenty-five million of them according to Mr. Benson - is well fed or adequately fed.", "I believe that we should not compare what our figures may be to India or some other country that has serious problems but to remember that we are the most prosperous country in the world and that these people are not getting adequate food.", "And they're not getting in many cases adequate shelter.", "And we ought to try to meet the problem.", "Secondly, Mr. Nixon has continued to state - and he stated it last week - these fantastic figures of what the Democratic budget would c- uh - platform would cost.", "They're wholly inaccurate.", "I said last week I believed in a balanced budget.", "Unless there was a severe recession - and after all the worst unbalanced budget in history was in 1958, twelve billion dollars - larger than in any Administration in the history of the United States.", "So that I believe that on this subject we can balance the budget unless we have a national emergency or unless we have a severe recession.", " Well, the United States uh - has on occasion attempted uh - mostly in the middle fifties, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to pull his troops back to Formosa.", "I believe strongly in the defense of Formosa.", "These islands are a few miles - five or six miles - off the coast of Red China, within a general harbor area and more than a hundred miles from Formosa.", "We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it's attacked.", "We say we will defend it if it's part of a general attack on Formosa.", "But it's extremely difficult to make that judgment.", "Now, Mr. Herter in 1958, when he was Under Secretary of State, said they were strategically undefensible.", "Admirals Spruance and Callins in 1955 said that we should not attempt to defend these islands, in their conference in the Far East.", "General Ridgway has said the same thing.", "I believe that when you get into a w- if you're going to get into war for the defense of Formosa, it ought to be on a clearly defined line.", "One of the problems, I think, at the time of South Korea was the question of whether the United States would defend it if it were attacked.", "I believe that we should defend Formosa.", "We should come to its defense.", "To leave this rather in the air, that we will defend it under some conditions but not under other, I think is a mistake.", "Secondly, I would not suggest the withdrawal at the point of the Communist gun.", "It is a decision finally that the Nationalists should make and I believe that we should consult with them and attempt to work out a plan by which the line is drawn at the island of Formosa.", "It leaves a hundred miles between the sea.", "But with General Ridgway, Mr. Herter, General Collins, Admiral Spruance and many others, I think it's unwise to take the chance of being dragged into a war which may lead to a world war over two islands which are not strategically defensible, which are not, according to their testimony, essential to the defense of Formosa.", "I think that uh - we should protect our commitments.", "I believe strongly we should do so in Berlin.", "I believe strongly we should d- do so in Formosa and I believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security we've guaranteed.", "But I do not believe that that line in case of war should be drawn on those islands but instead on the island of Formosa.", "And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa, it's been my judgment ever since 1954, at the time of the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Far East, that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself.", " I disagree completely with Senator Kennedy on this point.", "I remember in the period immediately before the Korean War, South Korea was supposed to be indefensible as well.", "Generals testified to that.", "And Secretary Acheson made a very famous speech at the Press Club, early in the year that k- Korean War started, indicating in effect that South Korea was beyond the defense zone of the United States.", "I suppose it was hoped when he made that speech that we wouldn't get into a war.", "But it didn't mean that.", "We had to go in when they came in.", "Now I think as far as Quemoy and Matsu are concerned, that the question is not these two little pieces of real estate - they are unimportant.", "It isn't the few people who live on them - they are not too important.", "It's the principle involved.", "These two islands are in the area of freedom.", "The Nationalists have these two islands.", "We should not uh - force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists.", "If we do that we start a chain reaction; because the Communists aren't after Quemoy and Matsu, they're a- they're after Formosa.", "In my opinion this is the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for America in Korea.", "I am against it.", "I would never tolerate it as president of the United States, and I will hope that Senator Kennedy will change his mind if he should be elected.", " Because that's the way we elect a president in this country, and it's the way we should.", "I'm a student of history as is Senator Kennedy, incidentally; and I have found that in the history of this country we've had many great presidents.", "Some of them have been Democrats and some of them have been Republicans.", "The people, some way, have always understood that at a particular time a certain man was the one the country needed.", "Now, I believe that in an election when we are trying to determine who should lead the free world - not just America - perhaps, as Senator Kennedy has already indicated, the most important election in our history - it isn't the label that he wears or that I wear that counts.", "It's what we are.", "It's our whole lives.", "It's what we stand for.", "It's what we believe.", "And consequently, I don't think it's enough to go before Republican audiences - and I never do - and say, \"Look, vote for me because I'm a Republican.\"", "I don't think it's enough for Senator Kennedy to go before the audiences on the Democratic side and say, \"Vote for me because I'm a Democrat.\"", "That isn't enough.", "What's involved here is the question of leadership for the whole free world.", "Now that means the best leadership.", "It may be Republican, it may be Democratic.", "But the people are the ones that determine it.", "The people have to make up their minds.", "And I believe the people, therefore, should be asked to make up their minds not simply on the basis of, \"Vote the way your grandfather did; vote the way your mother did.\"", "I think the people should put America first, rather than party first.", "Now, as far as running away from my party is concerned, Senator Kennedy has said that we have no compassion for the poor, that we are against progress - the enemies of progress, is the term that he's used, and the like.", "All that I can say is this: we do have programs in all of these fields - education, housing, defense - that will move America forward.", "They will move her forward faster, and they will move her more surely than in his program.", "This is what I deeply believe.", "I'm sure he believes just as deeply that his will move that way.", "I suggest, however, that in the interest of fairness that he could give me the benefit of also believing as he believes.", " Well, let me say I do think that parties are important in that they tell something about the program and something about the man.", "Abraham Lincoln was a great president of all the people; but he was selected by his party at a key time in history because his party stood for something.", "The Democratic party in this century has stood for something.", "It has stood for progress; it has stood for concern for the people's welfare.", "It has stood for a strong foreign policy and a strong national defense, and as a result, produced Wilson, President Roosevelt, and President Truman.", "The Republican party has produced McKinley and Harding, Coolidge, Dewey, and Landon.", "They do stand for something.", "They stand for a whole different approach to the problems facing this country at home and abroad.", "That's the importance of party; only if it tells something about the record.", "And the Republicans in recent years - not only in the last twenty-five years, but in the last eight years - have opposed housing, opposed care for the aged, opposed federal aid to education, opposed minimum wage and I think that record tells something.", " Miss Loomis, I think it's very appropriate that the first question in this first debate of Campaign '80 should relate to the economy of the country, because it seems to me that the people who are watching us tonight - 221 million Americans - are truly concerned about the poor rate of performance of the American economy over the last four years.", "Governor Reagan is not responsible for what has happened over the last four years, nor am I.", "The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend.", "But I want to answer as specifically as I can the question that you have just put to me.", "Let me tell you that I, first of all, oppose an election year tax cut, whether it is the 10% across-the-board tax cut promised to the taxpayers by my opponent in this debate tonight, or whether it is the $27.5 billion tax cut promised on the 20th of August by President Carter.", "I simply think that when we are confronting a budget deficit this year - and this fiscal year will end in about 10 days, and we are confronted with the possibility of a deficit of $60 billion, perhaps as much as $63 billion - that that simply would be irresponsible.", "That, once again, the printing presses will start to roll; once again we will see the monetization of that debt result in a higher rate of inflation.", "Even though we've seen some hopeful signs, perhaps, in the flash report on the third quarter, that perhaps the economy is coming out of the recession, we've also seen the rise in the rate of the prime; we have seen mortgage rates back up again, a sure sign of inflation in the housing industry.", "What I would propose, and I proposed it way back in March when I was a candidate in my own state of Illinois, I proposed $11.3 billion, specifically, in cuts in the Federal budget.", "I think we've got to have fiscal restraint.", "And I said at that time that one of the things that we could do, that perhaps would save as much as $5 billion to $7 billion, according, to one of the leading members of the House Budget Committee, was to recalculate the index that is used to determine the cost of living benefits that are paid to civil service retirees, to military retirees.", "That we ought to ... in addition to that, we ought to pay those retirement benefits on the basis of once a year, rather than twice a year, and save $750 billion.", "In other words....", " fiscal restraint, I think is necessary.", " I believe that the only unpopular measures, actually, that could be, or would be applied, would be unpopular with the government, and with those.", "perhaps, some special interest groups who are tied closely to government.", "I believe that inflation today is caused by government simply spending more than government takes in, at the same time that government has imposed upon business and industry, from the shopkeeper on the corner to the biggest industrial plant in America, countless harassing regulations and punitive taxes that have reduced productivity at the same time they have increased the cost of production.", "And when you are reducing productivity at the same time that you are turning out printing-press money in excessive amounts, you're causing inflation.", "And it isn't really higher prices, it's just, you are reducing the value of the money.", "You are robbing the American people of their savings.", "And so, the plan that I have proposed - and contrary to what John says, my plan is for a phased-in tax cut over a three-year period, tax increase and depreciation allowances for business and industry to give them the capital to refurbish plant and equipment, research and development, improved technology - all of which we see our foreign competitors having, and we have the greatest percentage of outmoded industrial plant and equipment of any of the industrial nations - produce more, have stable money supply, and give the people of this country a greater share of their own savings.", "Now, I know that this has been called inflationary by my opponent and by the man who isn't here tonight.", "But I don't see where it is inflationary to have people keep more of their earnings and spend it, and it isn't inflationary for government to take that money away from them and spend it on the things it wants to spend it on.", "I believe we need incentive for the individual, and for business and industry, and I believe the plan that I have submitted, with detailed backing, and which has been approved by a number of our leading economists in the country, is based on projections.", "conservative projections out for the next five years, that indicates that this plan would, by 1983, result in a balanced budget.", "We have to remember, when we talk a tax cut, we're only talking about reducing a tax increase, because this Administration has left us with a built-in tax increase that will amount to $86 billion next year.", " ...and $500 billion over the next five.", " Mr. Movers, in addition to saying that this is no time for a tax cut, in view of the incipient signs of renewed inflation, in addition to calling for restraint in Federal spending, 15 months ago, I also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline.", "I say that because I think, this year, we will send $90 billion out of this country to pay for imported oil, even though that.", "those imports have been reduced.", "And since I first made that proposal 15 months ago, the price of gasoline, which was then $.80, has gone up to about $1.30.", "In other words, we've had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country - or much of it - into the pockets of OPEC oil producers.", "Whereas I have proposed we ought to take.", "put that tax on here at home, reduce our consumption of that imported oil.", "Recycle those proceeds, then, back into the pockets of the American workers by reducing their tax payments.", "their Social Security tax payments by 50%.", "That, I think, in addition, would be an anti-inflationary measure that would strengthen the economy of this country.", " Well, I cannot see where a $.50 a gallon tax applied to gasoline would have changed the price of gasoline.", "It would still have gone up as much as it has, and the $.50 would be added on top of that.", "And it would be a tax paid by the consumers, and then we're asked to believe that some way, they would get this back to the consumers.", "But why?", "Why take it in the first place if you're going to give it back?", "Why not leave it with them?", "And John spoke about 15 years ago, on the position that he.", "or 15 months ago, on what he believed in.", "Fifteen months ago, he was a cosigner and advocating the very tax cut that I am proposing, and said that that would be a forward step in fighting inflation, and that it would be beneficial to the working people of this country.", " Well, I believe that conservation, at course, is worthy in and of itself.", "Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and I'm for it.", "But I do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the present energy problem, because all you're doing then is staving off, by a short time, the day when you would come to the end of the energy supply.", "To say that we are limited, and at a dangerous point in this country with regard to energy, I think, is to ignore the fact.", "The fact is, that in today's oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used.", "But it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground.", "And this is known oil reserves, known supplies.", "There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago.", "We have a coal supply that is equal to 50% of the world's coal supply, good for centuries, in this country.", "I grant you that prices may go up, because as you go further and have to go deeper, you are adding to the cost of production.", "We have nuclear power, which, I believe, with the safest.", "the most stringent of safety requirements, could meet our energy needs for the next couple of decades while we go forward exploring the areas of solar power and other forms of energy that might be renewable and that would not be exhaustible.", "All of these things can be done.", "When you stop and think that we are only drilling on 2%.", "have leased only 2% of the possible.", "possibility for oil of the continental shelf around the United States; when you stop to think that the government has taken over 100 million acres of land out of circulation in Alaska, alone, that is believed by geologists to contain much in the line of minerals and energy sources, then I think it is the Government, and the Government with its own restrictions and regulations, that is creating the energy crisis.", "That we are, indeed, an energy-rich nation.", " Well, Mr. Greenberg, I simply cannot allow to go unpassed the statements that have just been made by Mr. Reagan, who once again, has demonstrated, I think, a total misunderstanding of the energy crisis that confronts, not only this country, but the world, when he suggests that we have 27 years' supply of natural gas, 47 years' supply of oil, and all the rest, and that we really.", "all we have to do is to get the Government off the back of the oil industry, and that's going to be enough.", "I agree with what I think is the major premise of your question, sir, that we are going to have to create a new conservation ethic in the minds of the American people.", "and that's simply why I proposed, 15 months ago, the emergency excise tax on gasoline that I did.", "I did it as a security measure to be sure, because I would rather see us reduce the consumption of imported oil than have to send American boys to fight in the Persian Gulf.", "But at the same time, I think it's going to take a dramatic measure of that kind to convince the American people that we will have to reduce the use of the private automobile.", "We simply cannot have people sitting one behind the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams going in and out of our great cities.", "We are going to have to resort to van pooling, to car pooling.", "We're going to have to develop better community transportation systems, so that with buses and light rail, we can replace the private automobile in those places where it clearly is not energy-efficient.", "I think that, with respect to housing, when we are consuming, even though our per capita income today is about the same as that of the Federal Republic of Germany, we are consuming about, by a factor of two, the amount of energy that they consume in that country.", "Surely, there are things that we can do in the retrofitting, ;n the redesign of our homes, not only of our houses, but of our commercial structures, as well, that will make it possible for us to achieve.", "According to one study that was published a short time ago - the Harvard Business School study - indicated that just in the commercial sector alone of the economy, we could save between 30% and 40% of the energy that we consume in this country today.", "So I think, yes, we will have to change in a very appreciable way, some of the lifestyles that we now enjoy.", " Well, as I've said, I am not an enemy of conservation.", "I wouldn't be called a conservative if I were.", "But, when my figures are challenged, as the President himself challenged them after I made them, I think it should be called to the attention of John and the others here that my figures are the figures of the Department of Energy, which has not been overly optimistic in recent years as to how much supply we have left.", "That is the same Government that, in 1920, told us we only had enough oil left for 13 years, and 19 years later, told us we only had enough left for another 15 years.", "As for saving energy and conserving, the American people haven't been doing badly at that.", "Because in industry today, we're producing more, over the last several years, and at 12% less use of energy than we were back in about 1973.", "And motorists are using 8% less than they were back at that time of the oil embargo.", "So, I think we are proving that we can go forward with conservation and benefit from that.", "But also, I think it is safe to say that we do have sources of energy that have not yet been used or found.", " Mr. Greenberg, I think my opponent in this debate tonight is overlooking one other very important fact.", "And that is, that we cannot look at this as simply a national problem.", "Even though it's true that, perhaps, between now and the end of the decade, our total consumption of oil may not increase by more than, perhaps, a million or 2 million barrels of oil a day.", "The rest of the Western world, we are told, may see its consumption increase from 51 million barrels to about 66 million.", "And that additional 15 million barrels is going to cause scarcity.", "It is going to cause scarcity in world markets because there are at least five reputable studies, one even by the American Petroleum Institute itself, that, I think, clearly indicate that somewhere along around the end of the present decade, total world demand for oil is simply going to exceed total available supplies.", "I think that conservation - I think that a change in lifestyles - is necessary, and we had better begin to plan for that now rather than later.", " Mr. Corddry, I am well aware of the present deficiencies in the Armed Forces of this country.", "When you have a report, as we did recently, that six out of 10 CONUS Divisions in this country - Continental United States Army Divisions - simply could not pass a readiness test: that two out of three divisions that were to be allocated to the so-called Rapid Deployment Force could not meet a readiness test.", "And in most cases, that failure to meet the test was because of a lack of manning requirements, an inability to fill many of the slots in those divisions.", "Yes, I have seen figures that indicate that perhaps as of September, 1980 - this very month - that there is a shortage of about 104,000 in the ranks between E-4 and E-9.", "And there were reports.", "public reports not long ago about ships that could not leave American ports because of a lack of crews.", "I talked to one of the leading former chiefs of Naval operations in my office a few weeks ago, who told me about 25,000 Chief Petty Officers being short.", "But, I think that that is clearly related to the fact that, going back to the time when the all-volunteer Army was created in 1973 - and I worked hard for it and supported it - we simply have failed to keep pace with the cost of living.", "And today, on the average, the average serviceman is at least 15% - and I happen to think that's a very modest estimate - 15% below what has happened to the cost of living over that period of time.", "And as a result, the families of some of our young servicemen are on food stamps today.", "And I think that's shocking; it's shameful.", "So, yes, I told the American Legion National!", "Convention, the VFW National Convention - when I spoke to each of those bodies - I outlined a very specific program of increasing pay and allowances, reenlistment bonuses.", "That only makes sense.", "But I would leave you with this thought, sir, to be quite specific in my answer to your question: that, of course, to protect the vital interests of this country, if that became impossible; if I could not, despite the very best efforts that I asked the Congress to put forward, to raise those pay and incentives and allowances, of course, I would not leave this country go undefended.", " Mr. Corddry, it's a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement on this particular issue, and the only one who would be disagreeing with us is the President, if he were present.", "I. too, believe in the voluntary military.", "As a matter of fact, today the shortages of non-commissioned officers that John mentioned are such that if we tried to have a draft today, we wouldn't have the non-commissioned officers to train the draftees.", "I believe the answer lies in just recognizing human nature and how we make everything else work in this country, when we want it to work.", "Recognize that we have a voluntary military.", "We are asking for men and women to join the military as a career, and we're asking them to deal with the most sophisticated of equipment.", "And a young man is out there on a $1 billion carrier in charge of the maintenance of a $20 million aircraft, working 100 hours a week at times, and he's earning less for himself and his family, while he's away from his family, than he could earn if he were in one of the most menial jobs, working 40 hours a week here at home.", "As an aid to enlistment.", "we had an aid - 46% of the people who enlisted in the voluntary military up until 1977 said they did so for one particular reason, the G.I.", "Bill of Rights - the fact that, by serving in the military, they could provide for a future college education.", "In 1977, we took that away from the military.", "That meant immediately 46% of your people that were signing up had no reason for signing up.", "So I think it is a case of pay scale, of recognizing that if we're going to have young men and women responsible for our security, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heaven's sakes, let's go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that we're asking of them.", "Along with this, I think we need something else that has been allowed to deteriorate.", "We need a million-man active reserve that could be called up on an instant's notice, and that would be also trained, ready to use that type of equipment.", "Both of these, I think, would respond to the proper kind of incentives that we could offer these people.", "The other day, I just - I'll hasten - I just saw one example.", "Down in Texas.", "I saw a high school that is military.", " Fine.", " I'll catch up with it later.", " Mr. Moyers.", "I must say that I think I have better opportunity, however, of finding the necessary funds to pay what, admittedly, will be very, very substantial sums of money.", "We signed one bill.", "or we passed one bill, just a couple of weeks ago in the House of Representatives for $500 million - a half a billion dollars.", "That is just a downpayment, in my opinion.", "But, unlike Governor Reagan, I do not support a boondoggle like the MX missile.", "I've just gotten a report from the Air Force that indicates that the 30-year lifecycle cost of that system is going to be $100 billion.", "The initial cost is about $54 billion, and then when you add in the additional costs - not only the construction of the system, the missiles and the personnel, and so on - when you add in the additional costs over the lifecycle of that system, over $100 billion.", "I would propose to save the taxpayers of this country from that kind of costly boondoggle.", " Well, let me just say that, with regard to that same missile system, I happen to support and believe in the missile, itself.", "But that's not the $54 billion cost that John is talking about.", "He's talking about that fantastic plan of the Administration to take thousands and thousands of square miles out in the Western states.", "And first, he was going to dig a racetrack and have it going around in the racetrack so it would meet the requirements of SALT II treaty, and now he's decided it'll have a straight up and down thing, so it can he both verifiable and yet hideable from the Soviet Union.", "We need the missile, I think, because we are so out of balance strategically that we lack a deterrent to a possible first assault.", "But I am not in favor of the plan that is so costly.", "And therefore, if I only had another second left, I'd say that that high school class in a military training - 40 of its 80 graduates last year entered the United States service academies; West Point, Annapolis and the Air Force Academy, and to see those young men made me very proud to realize that there are young people in this country that are prepared to go into that kind of a career in service of their country.", " I don't think I'd have to go against that pledge.", "I think one of the problems today with the cities is Federal aid.", "The mayors that I've talked to in some of our leading cities tell!", "me that the Federal grants that come with.", "for a specific cause or a specific objective, come with such red tape, such priorities established by a bureaucracy in Washington, that the local government's hands are tied with regard to using that money as they feel could best be used, and for what they think might be the top priority.", "If they had that money without those government restrictions, every one of them has told me they could make great savings and make far greater use of the money.", "What I have been advocating is, why don't we start with the Federal Government turning back tax sources to states and local governments, as well as the responsibilities for those programs?", "Seventy-five percent of the people live in the cities.", "I don't know of a city in America that doesn't have the kind of problems you're talking about.", "But, where are we getting the money that the Federal Government is putting out to help them?", "New York is being taxed for money that will then go to Detroit.", "But Detroit is being taxed for money that, let's say, will go to Chicago, while Chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in Philadelphia.", "Wouldn't it make a lot more sense if the government let them keep their own money there in the first place?", "But there are other things that we can do with the inner cities, and I've believed.", "I have talked of having zones in those cities that are run down, where there is a high percentage of people on welfare, and offer tax incentives.", "The government isn't getting a tax now from businesses there because they aren't there, or from individuals who are on welfare rather than working.", "And why don't we offer incentives for business and industry to start up in those zones?", "Give them a tax moratorium for a period if they build and develop there.", "The individuals that would then get jobs - give them a break that encourages them to leave the social welfare programs and go to work.", "We could have an urban homestead act.", "We've got thousands and thousands of homes owned by government boarded up, being vandalized, that have been taken in mortgage foreclosures.", "What if we had a homestead act, and said to the people, for $1 we sell you this house.", "All have to do is agree to refurbish it, make it habitable, and live in it - just as 100 or more years ago, we did with the open land in this country - urban .", "or country homesteading.", " Mr. May, I recently saw a Princeton University study that indicated that the cities of America - the large cities of this country - are in worse shape today than they were in 1960.", "It seems to totally belie the claim that I heard President Carter make a few days ago, that he was the first President that had come forth with a real urban strategy to meet the problems of urban America.", "Incidentally, just this past week, the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen, I guess, because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits.", "I'm happy to say that, in contrast to that, the Anderson-Lucey platform for America, program for the 80s, has devoted considerable time, and in very specific detail, we have talked about two things that ought to be done to aid urban America.", "We call, first of all, for the creation of a $4 billion urban reinvestment trust fund to do exactly what you spoke about in your question - to rebuild the streets, to rebuild the cities, the leaking water mains.", "I was in North Pittsburgh - I think it was a few weeks ago, on my campaign - the water mains in that city had begun to leak, and literally, there wasn't money available to fix them.", "And until we can begin to recreate the basic infrastructure of the great cities of America, particularly in the upper Midwest and in the Northeast, they simply are not going to provide the kind of economic climate that will enable them to retain industry, enable them to retain the kind of solid industrial base that they need, so that they can provide jobs.", "We have also provided in our program for a $4 billion Community Trust Fund, and we've told you where the money is coming from.", "It's going to come from the dedication, by 1984, of the excise revenues that today are being collected by the Federal Government on alcohol and tobacco.", "That money, I think, ought to be put into rebuilding the base of our cities.", "In addition to that, jobs programs to re-employ the youth in our cities would be very high on my priority list, both the Youth Opportunities Act of 1980 and a billion-dollar program that I would recommend to put youth to work in energy projects, in conservation projects, in projects that would carry out some of the great national goals of our country.", " Yes.", "Government claims.", "John claims that he is making plain where the money will come from.", "It will come from the pockets of the people.", "It will come from the pockets of the people who are living in those very areas.", "And the problem is, with Governments - Federal, State and Local - taking $.44 out of every dollar earned, that the Federal Government has pre-empted too many of the tax sources, and that the cities.", "if Pittsburgh does not have the money to fix the leaking water mains, it's because the Federal Government has pre-empted.", "Now, the Federal Government is going to turn around and say, well you have this problem; we will now hand you the money to do it.", "But the Federal Government doesn't make money.", "It just takes - from the people.", "And in my view, this is not the answer to the problem.", "Stand in the South Bronx as I did, in the spot where Jimmy Carter made his promise that he was going to, with multi-billion dollar programs, refurbish that area that looks like bombed-out London in World War II.", "I stood there, and I met the people.", "And I heard them ask just for something that would give them hope.", "And I believe that, while all of the promises have been broken, they've never been carried out.", "But I believe that my plan might offer an opportunity for that, if we would move into those areas and let, encourage - with the tax incentive - the private sector, to develop and to create the jobs for the people.", " Well, of course, where has the private sector been, Governor Reagan, during the years that our cities have been deteriorating?", "It seems to me that to deny the responsibility of the Federal Government to do something about our crumbling cities is to deny the opportunity for one thing: To 55% of the black population of our country that is locked within the inner cities of the metropolitan areas of our country.", "We simply cannot ignore the fact that, in those cities today, we have 55% youth unemployment among black and Hispanic youth.", "And why is that?", "It's because they have lost their industry.", "And why have they lost their industry?", "It's because they no longer present the kind of viable economic climate that makes it possible for industry to remain there, or to locate there.", "I think Government has a responsibility to find jobs for the youth of this country, and that the place to start is to assist in the very important and necessary task of helping cities rebuild.", " Miss Quinn, I would be very happy to accept the challenge of your question tonight, to tell the voters of this country exactly what I think it's going to cost, because I believe that all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver.", "When these Presidential Debates were held just four years ago, I remember the incumbent President, who was willing to debate, President Ford, telling the American people that they simply ought not to vote for somebody who promised more than they could deliver.", "Well, we've seen what has happened.", "We haven't gotten either the economies in Government that were promised; we haven't gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carter's first term.", "Instead we had, I think, in the second quarter, a Consumer Price Index registering around 12%.", "And nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the Wholesale Price Index - that's about 18% on an annualized basis - what it's going to be.", "Let me say this.", "I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan.", "His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information.", "He went so far as to call it \"brutal economics.\"", "I've been very careful - I have been very careful in saying that what I'm going to do is to bring Federal spending under control first.", "I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done.", "But, you know, it's gotten to be about $122 difference.", "Somebody worked it out.", "And they figured out that between the tax cut that Governor Reagan is promising the American people, and the tax cut that Jimmy Carter is promising in 198I, his is worth about $122 more.", "So you, dear voters, are out there on the auction block, and these two candidates are bidding for your votes.", "And one is going to give you $122 more if you happen to be in that range of about a $20,000-a-year income.", "I'm going to wait until I see that that inflation rate is going down, before I even begin to phase in the business tax cuts that I've talked about.", "But I think, by improving productivity, they would be far less inflationary than the consumption-oriented tax cut that Governor Reagan is recommending.", " Miss Quinn, I don't have to.", "I've done it.", "We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures.", "And we used - yes, we used - the Senate Budget Committee's projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5% - which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated.", "And eliminated probably more quickly than our plan, but we wanted to be so conservative with it, that people would see how.", "how well it could be done.", "Now, John's been in the Congress for 20 years.", "And John tells us that first, we've got to reduce spending before we can reduce taxes.", "Well, if you've got a kid that's extravagant, you can lecture him all you want to about his extravagance.", "Or you can cut his allowance and achieve the same end much quicker.", "But Government has never reduced Government does not tax to get the money it needs.", "Government always needs the money it gets.", "And when John talks about his non-inflationary plan, as far as I have been able to learn, there are 88 proposals in it that call for additional Government spending programs.", "Now, I speak with some confidence of our plan, because I took over a state - California - 10% of the population of this nation - a state that, if it were a nation, would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world.", "And that state we controlled spending.", "We cut the rate of increase in spending in half.", "But at the same time, we gave back to the people of California - in tax rebates, tax credits, tax cuts - $5.7 billion.", "I vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned.", "And among those vetoes, I stopped $16 billion in additional spending.", "And the funny thing was that California, which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment, for those six years for the first time, was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment.", "We have considered inflation in our figures.", "We deliberately took figures that we, ourselves, believed were too conservative.", "I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983, and it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and that's what he's counting on for his plan.", "But he's going to get a half-a-trillion dollars more over the next five years that he can use for additional programs, or hopefully, someplace down the line, balancing the budget.", "We believe that that's too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people.", " Mr. Moyers, I'm not here to debate Governor Reagan's record as Governor.", "This is 1980 and not 1966.", "But I do know that, despite his pledge to reduce state Government spending, that it rose from $4.6 billion when he took office in 1967, to $10.2 billion during his eight years in office.", "Spending, in other words.", "more than doubled, and it rose at a faster rate than spending was rising in the Federal Government.", "But on his very optimistic figures about his tax cut producing a balanced budget by 1983, and the fact that he is using, he says, the figures of the Senate Budget Committee, that Senate Budget Committee Report does not accommodate all of the Reagan defense plans.", "It doesn't accommodate the expenditures that he calls for, for accelerated development and deployment of a new manned strategic bomber, for a permanent fleet in the Indian Ocean, for the restoration of the fleet to 600 ships, to the development and deployment of a dedicated modern aircraft interceptor.", "In other words, I have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million a year, just for the military.", "And I think the figures that he has given are simply not going to stand up.", " Well, some people look up figures, and some people make up figures.", "And John has just made up some very interesting figures.", "We took the Senate report, of course.", "But we did factor in our own ideas with regard to increases in the projected military spending that we believe would, over a period of time, do what is necessary.", "Now also, with regard to the figures about California.", "The truth of the matter is, we did cut the increase in spending in half.", "It at the John doesn't quite realize - he's never held an executive position of that kind.", "And I think being Governor of California is probably the closest thing to the Presidency, if that's possible, of any executive job in America today - because it is the most populous state.", "And I can only tell him that we reduced, in proportion of other states, the per capita spending, the per capita size of Government - we only increased the size of Government one-twelfth what it had increased in the preceding eight years.", "And one journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, a respected newspaper, said there was no question about the fact that Governor Reagan had prevented the State of California from going bankrupt.", " Oh, I'm it's my question.", "But whether I agree or disagree with some individual, or what he may say, or how he may say it, I don't think there's any way that we can suggest that because people believe in God and go to church, that they should not want reflected in those people and those causes they support, their own belief in morality, and in the high traditions and principles which we've abandoned so much in this country.", "Going around this country, I think that I have found a great hunger in America for a spiritual revival.", "For a belief that law must be based on a higher law.", "For a return to traditions and values that we once had.", "Our Government, in its most sacred documents - the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and all - speak of man being created, of a Creator.", "That we're a nation under God.", "Now, I have thought for a long time that too many of our churches have been too reluctant to speak up in behalf of what they believe is proper in Government, and they have been too too lax in interfering, in recent years, with Government's invasion of the family itself, putting itself between parent and child.", "I vetoed a number of bills of that kind myself, when I was in California.", "Now, whether it is rightful, on a single issue, for anyone to advocate that someone should not be elected or not, I won't take a position on that.", "But I do believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to express themselves, or to even try to persuade others to follow their leader.", "That's what elections are all about.", " Ms. Golden, certainly the church has the right to take a position on moral issues.", "But to try, as occurred in the case that you mentioned - that specific case - to try to tell the parishioners of any church, of any denomination, how they should vote, or for whom they should vote, I think violates the principle of separation of church and state.", "Now, Governor Reagan is running on a platform that calls for a Constitutional amendment banning abortion.", "I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual.", "And for the state to interfere with a Constitutional amendment, and tell a woman that she must carry that pregnancy to term, regardless of her personal belief, that, I think, violates freedom of conscience as much as anything that I can think of.", "And he is also running on a platform that suggests a litmus test for the selection of judges - that only judges that hold a certain, quote, \"view,\" on the sanctity of family life, ought to be appointed to the Federal Judiciary, one of the three great independent branches of our Government.", "No.", "I believe in freedom of choice.", "I don't believe in Constitutional Amendments that would interfere with that.", "I don't believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the Federal Judiciary.", "On the Amendment that you mentioned, I abandoned it 15 years ago.", "And I have said freely, all over this country, that it was a mistake for me or anyone to ever try to put the Judeo-Christian heritage of this country, important as it is, and important as my religious faith is to me - it's a very deeply personal matter.", "But for me to try, in this very pluralistic society of ours, to try to frame any definition, whatever, of what that belief should be, is wrong.", "And so, not once, but twice - in 1971 - I voted on the floor of the House of Representatives against a Constitutional amendment that tried to bring prayer back into the public schools.", "I think mother ought to whisper to Johnny and to Susie, as they button their coats in the morning and leave for the classroom, \"Be sure to say a prayer before you start your day's work.\"", "But I don't think that the state, the Board of Regents, a Board of Education, or any state official, should try to compose that prayer for a child to recite.", " The litmus test that John says is in the Republican platform, says no more than the judges to be appointed should have a respect for innocent life.", "Now, I don't think that's a bad idea.", "I think all of us should have a respect for innocent life.", "With regard to the freedom of the individual for choice with regard to abortion, there's one individual who's not being considered at all.", "That's the one who is being aborted.", "And I've noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born.", "I I think that, technically, I know this is a difficult and an emotional problem, and many people sincerely feel on both sides of this, but I do believe that maybe we could find the answer through medical evidence, if we would determine once and for all, is an unborn child a human being?", "I happen to believe it is.", " I also think that that unborn child has a right to be wanted.", "And I also believe, sir, that the most personal intimate decision that any woman is ever called upon to make is the decision as to whether or not she shall carry a pregnancy to term.", "And for the state to interfere in that decision, under whatever guise, and with whatever rationale, for the state to try to take over in that situation, and by edict, command what the individual shall do, and substitute itself for that individual's conscience, for her right to consult her rabbi, her minister, her priest, her doctor - any other counselor of her choice - I think goes beyond what we want to ever see accomplished in this country, if we really believe in the First Amendment: if we really believe in freedom of choice and the right of the individual.", " Before beginning my closing remarks, here, I would just like to remark a concern that I have that we have criticized the failures of the Carter policy here rather considerably, both of us this evening.", "And there might be some feeling of unfairness about this because he was not here to respond.", "But I believe it would have been much more unfair to have had John Anderson denied the right to participate in this debate.", "And I want to express my appreciation to the League of Women Voters for adopting a course with which I believe the great majority of Americans are in agreement.", "Now, as to my closing remarks: I've always believed that this land was placed here between the two great oceans by some divine plan.", "That it was placed here to be found by a special kind of people - people who had a special love for freedom and who had the courage to uproot themselves and leave hearth and homeland, and came to what, in the beginning, was the most undeveloped wilderness possible.", "We came from 100 different corners of the earth.", "We spoke a multitude of tongues.", "We landed on this Eastern shore and then went out over the mountains and the prairies and the deserts and the far western mountains to the Pacific, building cities and towns and farms, and schools and churches.", "If wind, water or fire destroyed them, we built them again.", "And in so doing, at the same time, we built a new breed of human called an American - a proud, an independent., and a most compassionate individual, for the most part.", "Two hundred years ago, Tom Paine, when

our natural resources, and the issue of nationalism - that I intend to be talking about in the remaining six weeks of this campaign, and I dare hope that the American people will be listening and that

time.", "(Laughter and applause)", " I'll let you all figure out the rules, I've got some points that I want to make here, and I still haven't gotten an answer to my question on when you guys are

trickle-down to the very last drop.", "And, you know, talking about this point of concentrating on every other country in the world as opposed to the people of our country right here at home, when George Bush took former Secretary of State Baker out of the State Dept and put him in charge of the campaign and made him chief of staff in the White, Mr. Baker, who's quite a capable man, said that for these last 4 years George Bush was working on the problems of the rest of the world and in the next 4 years he would target America.", "Well, I want you to know we really appreciate that.", "But Bill Clinton and I will target America from day one.", "We won't wait 4 years before we concentrate on the problems in this country.", "He went on to say that it's really amazing what George Bush can do when he concentrates.", "Well, it's time that we had a president like Bill Clinton who can concentrate and will concentrate and work on the problems of real people in this country.", "You know, our country is in trouble.", "We simply cannot continue with this philosophy of giving huge tax cuts to the very wealthy, raising taxes on middle income families the way Bush and Quayle have done and then

which you're for.", "But the question --", " Well, I'd like to hear the answer.", " But the question is -- the question is -- and which you have failed to address, and that is, why is Bill Clinton qualified to be president of the US.", "You've talked about --", " Oh, I'll be happy to answer that question --", " You've talked about Jim Baker.", "You've talked about trickle down economics.",

to go back and make a point --", " Well, you've asked me the question.", "If you won't answer my question I will answer yours.", " I have not asked you a question.", "I've made a statement.", "I have not asked you a question, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made a statement that you have not told us why Bill Clinton is qualified to be president of the US.", "I pointed out what he said about the Persian Gulf War.", "But let me repeat it for you.", "Here's what he said, Senator.", "You know full well what he said.", " You want me to answer your question?", " I'm making a statement.", "Then you can answer it.", " (Inaudible) here's what he said.", "I mean, this is the Persian Gulf War -- the most important event in his political lifetime and here's what Bill Clinton says.", "If it's a close vote, I'd vote with the majority.", " But he was the minority.", "That qualifies you for being president of the US.", "I hope America is listening very closely to this debate tonight.", " And I think America is seeing right now the reason this nation is in gridlock.", "(Laughter, applause)  The trickle downs and the tax and spends, or whatever you want to call them are at swords points.", "We can't get this economy going.", "Over here we've got Dan whose president is going to take 8 years to balance the budget and on my left, the senator, whose boss is going to get it half way balanced in 4 years.", "Ross Perot has got a plan to balance the budget 5 years in length from start to finish.", "And we're -- people of the non-professional category who are just sick of this terrible thing that's happened to the country.", "And we've got a man who knows how to fix it, and I'm working for him.", "(APPLAUSE)", " The lifeblood of our economy is investment.", "And right now when we pay $350 -- we borrow $350 billion a year it saps the money markets and the private investors are not getting their share.", "What we do is work on that budget by an aggressive program, not a painful program, so that we can start borrowing less money and getting more investment money on the street through entrepreneurs who can build factories, who will hire people, and maybe we'll start manufacturing goods here in this country again.", "That's -- that's my answer.", " Bill Clinton's top priority is putting America back to work.", "Bill Clinton and I will create good, high-wage jobs for our people, the same way he has done in his state.", "Bill Clinton has created high-wage manufacturing jobs at 10 times the national average and in fact according to the statistics coming from the Bush-Quayle Labor Dept, for the last 2 years in a role Bill Clinton's state has been number one among all 50 in the creation of jobs in the private sector.", "By contrast, in the nation as a whole, during the last 4 years, it is the first time since the presidency of Herbert Hoover, that we have gone for a 4-year period with fewer jobs at the end of that 4-year period than we had at the beginning.", "And look at manufacturing.", "We have lost 1.4 million jobs in manufacturing under George Bush and Dan Quayle.", "They have even -- we learned 2 weeks ago -- taken our tax dollars and subsidized the moving of US factories to foreign countries.", "Now don't deny it because 60 Minutes and Nightline and the nation's newspapers have investigated this very carefully.", "(Laughter.)", "When are you going to stop using our tax dollars to shut down American factories and move 'em to foreign countries and throw Americans out of work?", " Senator, don't always believe what you see on television.", "(APPLAUSE.)", " the media have been wrong before.", "We have never subsidized any country -- or any company to move from the US to Latin America.", "You know full well the Caribbean Basin Initiative, you've supported that.", " No.", " That is a program there --", " I voted against it.", " You voted for it and your record --", " No.", " Okay.", "Well, we'll -- we'll have a lot of interesting debate after this debate.", "Our people will be glad to furnish the press, if they're interested, in Senator Gore's voting record on the Caribbean Basin Initiative.", "But let's talk -- you know, you keep talking about trickle-down economics and all this stuff, about the worst economy since Hoover.", "It is a bad economy.", "It's a tough economy.", "The question isn't -- it's not who you're going to blame; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what are you going to do about it?", "Your proposal it to raise $150 billion in taxes.", "To raise $220 billion in new spending.", " No.", " How is raising taxes going to help small business?", "How is raising taxes going to help the farmer?", "How is raising taxes going to help the consumer in America?", "I submit to you that raising taxes will make matters much, much worse.", "(APPLAUSE.)", " Well, we've got to re -- we've got to clean out the barn, if I may quote my boss, and start getting this investment money on the street so we can get, and encourage entrepreneurs to build factories.", "We -- the program is out there.", "It's a put-together thing that requires some sacrifice, but not excessive, and we are willing to move forward in -- on a 5-year clip to put us back where we can start over and get -- get this nation straightened out.", " Well, the difference between the Perot- Stockdale plan and the Clinton-Gore plan is that Ross Perot's plan concentrates almost exclusively on balancing the budget and reducing the budget deficit, and the danger is that if that is the only goal it could throw our nation back into an even worse recession.", "Bill Clinton and I have a detailed 5-year budget plan to create good jobs, cut the budget deficit in half, and eliminate the investment deficit in order to get our economy moving forward again.", "We have a $20-billion infrastructure fund to create a nationwide network of high-speed rail, for example, and what are called information superhighways to open up a whole universe of knowledge for our young people and to help our universities and companies that rely on new advances in the information revolution.", "We also have tax incentives for investment in job-creating activities, not the kind of encouragement for short-term rip-offs like the proposal that we have had from George Bush.", "But I want to return and say one more time: you have used our tax dollars to subsidize the recruitment of US companies to move overseas and throw Americans out of work.", "In Decaturville, Tennessee, not very far from my home, a factory was shut down right there when they were solicited by officials paid with US taxpayers' money, and then the replacement workers in a foreign country were trained with our tax dollars and then their imports were subsidized coming back into the US.", "When are you going to stop that program?", " We do not have any program that encourages companies to close down here and to go and invest on foreign soil.", "That is absolutely outrageous.", "Of course American businesses do have business abroad; we've got global competition.", "We want businesses to expand.", "Do you realize this, Senator, that every job that's overseas there's 3 jobs back here to support that.", "But never have we ever, nor would we, support the idea of someone closing down a factory here and moving overseas.", "That's just totally ridiculous.", " It's going on right now; it happened in Tennessee, in Decaturville, Tennessee.", "When George Bush went to Nashville, the employees who lost their jobs asked to meet with --", " I want to get back --", " I talked with them.", "Let me tell you what they're feeling.", "Some of them are in their 50s and 60s.", "They want to know where they're going to get new jobs when their jobs have been destroyed.", "And there are 1.4 million manufacturing jobs that have been lost because of the policies of you and George Bush.", "Do you seriously believe that we ought to continue the same policies that have created the worst economy since the Great Depression?", " I hope that when you talked to those people you said: and the first thing that Bill Clinton and I are going to do is to raise $150 billion in new taxes.", " You got that wrong, too.", " And the first -- that is part of your plan.", " No, it's not.", " A hundred and fifty billion dollars in new taxes.", "Well, you're going to disavow your plan.", " Listen, what we're proposing --", " You know what you're doing, you know what you're doing?", "You're pulling a Clinton.", "(Laughter)  And you know what a Clinton is?", "And you know what Clinton is?", "A Clinton is, is what he says -- he says one thing one day and another thing the next day -- you try to have both sides of the issues.", "The fact of the matter is that you are proposing $150 billion in new taxes.", " No.", " And I hope that you talk to the people in Tennessee --", " No, we're not.", " -- and told them that --", " You can say it all you want but it doesn't make it true.", " -- going to have new taxes.", "I hope you talked to them about the fact that you were going to increase spending to $220 billion.", "I'm sure what you didn't talk to them about was about how we're going to reform the health care system, like the president wants to do.", "He wants to go out and to reform the health care system so that every American will have available to them affordable health insurance.", "I'm sure one other thing that you didn't talk to them about, Senator, and that is legal reform, because your position on legal reform is the status quo.", "And yet you talk about foreign competition.", "Why should an American company have to spend 15 to 20 times on product liability and insurance costs compared to a company in Japan or a company in Germany or somewhere else?", "That's not right.", "We have product liability reform legislation on Capitol Hill.", "It will create jobs.", "And a Democratic Congress won't pass it.", "(APPLAUSE)", " Bill Clinton and I support a strong national defense.", "He and I have both fought for change within the Democratic Party as well as within the country.", "In the aftermath of the Cold War, the definition of strong national defense has obviously changed somewhat.", "For example, George Bush wants to maintain at least 150,000 American soldiers in Europe, even though World War II ended 50 years ago.", "Bill Clinton and I agree with so many military experts who believe that it is time for the Europeans, who are so much wealthier now and more powerful than they were at the end of World War II to start picking up a little more of that tab themselves and not rely so exclusively on the US taxpayers for the defense of Europe.", "We believe that we can make savings in our defense budget and at the same time, improve our national security.", "Now, for those who are affected by the cutbacks, whether they come from George Bush or Bill Clinton and me -- the difference is, Bill Clinton and I have a defense conversion program so that those who won the Cold War will not be left out in the cold.", "We want to put them to work, building an infrastructure and an economy here in this country for the '90's and the next century.", " We won the Cold War because we invested in national security.", "We won the Cold War because we invested in our military.", "We didn't win the Cold -- we won the Cold War because we invested in national security.", "We won the Cold War because America had the political will and made the right decisions.", "Yes, we can make the cuts in defense and we have.", "Bill Clinton wants to cut defense another $60 billion.", "I'd say to the defense workers in California and elsewhere, a $60 billion defense cut is going to cut a lot of jobs out.", "Yes, we are making a conversion and we can go to a civil space rather than having defense -- or the defense industry.", "Well, let me say this: we would not have won the Cold War if we had listened to Senator Gore and his crowd, and had supported a nuclear freeze.", "If you would have supported that attitude -- if you would have supported that attitude, we would not have won the Cold War.", "We won the Cold War because we invested and we went forward.", "(APPLAUSE.)", " Yes, thanks.", "The numbers, in terms of the dollar cuts, as they stand on our plans now, show us almost the same as the vice president's.", "But we'd note that Mr. -- Governor Clinton's plan is almost twice as much a cut as either one of us.", "I've been through the end of World War II, and the surprise beginning of Korea, to see how we -- it cost us more money because we overcut the defense budget in the first place.", "I don't say that -- (APPLAUSE.)", "So I think that should be eyed with great suspicion, people that are really kicking the props out from under our grand military establishment prematurely.", "Now there's other differences between the Perot approach and what we see up here on either side of me, and that has to do with we want to focus our interests, economic and military, more to the Pacific.", "We figure that we are generally going along with any sort of a troop removal from Europe.", "So that's still another face of this puzzle.", " Yeah, I'd like to respond first to you, Admiral Stockdale.", "Under the details of our 5-year budget plan, we do propose more in defense cuts than George Bush and Dan Quayle, but only 5 % more.", "Admiral Crowe, who I think was one of your classmates in Annapolis --", " Oh, yes, I've known him --", " -- has endorsed --", " -- 50 years.", " -- the military portions of our plan, even though he was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs under George Bush, and John White has endorsed the economic aspects of our plan, even though I believe he was the architect of Ross Perot's economic plan.", "Now when I heard George Bush say at the convention in Houston, that when he heard the phrase \"we won the Cold War,\" it made him wonder who the \"we\" was.", "Well, I want to tell you, President Bush, the \"we\" is the people of the US of America.", "This wasn't a partisan victory that came suddenly, a few months after you took the oath of office.", "This started with Harry Truman and it was a bipartisan effort from the very beginning.", "George Bush taking credit for the Berlin Wall coming down is like the rooster taking credit for the sunrise.", "(APPLAUSE.)", "And I want to, I want to add -- I want to add one other thing, because in the debate a few nights ago, I think President Bush made a very serious misstatement of fact in response to Ross Perot.", "It was kind of a little lecture he gave to Ross Perot when he said those SS-18s are gone, Ross, that's done.", "He -- he reached a deal with Boris Yeltsin to completely remove them so we can all sleep safely without any fear tonight.", "But you know what?", "They thought they were going to get that deal, but when he took the person in charge of the negotiations out of the State Dept and put him in charge of the reelection campaign, the deal unraveled and now there is no START II deal at all.", "In fact there are serious problems.", "Isn't it a fact, Dan, that every single one of those SS-18s is still there, in the silos, and under the START I treaty, only half of the silos are supposed to be dismantled, and there is no deal to get rid of the other half?", "Didn't the president make a mistake there?", " The president does have a commitment from Boris Yeltsin to eliminate the SS-18s.", "That is a commitment to --", " Is it an agreement?", " It is a commitment.", " Oh.", "(Laughter)", " Let's talk about, let's talk about --", " Well, he said he'd --", " Lighten up here, Al.", "(Laughter and applause)", " Let's talk about getting agreements.", "You know, the president of the US doesn't just negotiate with your friends in Congress; the president of the US deals on the international scene.", "He's got to deal with the president of Russia, he's got to deal with the chancellor of Germany, the prime minister of Britain, the president of France, the prime minister of Japan -- he's got to deal with a whole host of leaders around the world.", "And the leaders sit down and they will negotiate, and they will come to agreements with people that they trust.", "And this is a fundamental problem with Bill Clinton, is trust and character.", "It is not the issue of how he avoided military service 20-some years ago; it's the fact -- it's the fact that he does not tell the truth about it.", "He first said he didn't get an induction notice, then we find out that he did; he said he didn't have an ROTC slot, then we find out he did; he said he didn't use Senator Fulbright's office for special influence, then we find out that he did.", "These are inconsistencies.", "Bill Clinton has trouble telling the truth.", "And he will have a very difficult time dealing with somebody like President Yeltsin or Chancellor Kohl or Prime Minister Major or President Mitterrand, because truth and integrity are prerequisites to being president of the US.", "(APPLAUSE)", " I want to respond to that, I want to respond to that.", "George Bush, in case you've forgotten, Dan, said

wanted to be the environmental president; then he went on to say he wanted to be the education president.", "Then he said that he wouldn't raise taxes again -- no, never, ever, ever.", "Then the next day his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, came out and said that's not a pledge.", "Then 2 weeks ago he said that after the election, if you win, then James Baker's going to go back to be secretary of state; then a week later, in the debate a few nights ago, he said, no, after the election, if we win, James Baker is going to be in charge of domestic policy.", "Which is it, Dan?", "Is he going to -- what's your role in this going to be?", "(Laughter and applause)", " Let me --", " I don't have time to respond to that?", " Okay, you're the moderator.", "I was under the assumption that when the thing is like that that you get a chance to respond.", " Okay.", "Well, you got the last word on that, but we'll come back to it.", " I'm enjoying it.", "(Laughter)", " Look over there.",

people in the Northwest where they say that, well, we can only save the owl, forget about jobs.", "You ought to talk to the coal miners.", "They're talking about putting a coal tax on.", "They're talking about a tax on utilities, a tax on gasoline and home heating oil -- all sorts of taxes.", "No, Hal, the choice isn't the environment and jobs.", "With the right policies -- prudent policies -- we can have both.", "(APPLAUSE)", " I read Senator Gore's book about the environment and I don't see how he could possibly pay for his proposals in today's economic climate.", "(APPLAUSE)  You know,

our feet and bringing up the rear.", "You know, Japan and Germany are both opening proclaiming to the world now that the biggest new market in the history of world business is the market for the new products and technologies that foster economic progress without environmental destruction.", "Why is the Japanese business organization -- the largest one they have, the Ki Den Ren (phonetic), arguing for tougher environmental standards than those embodied in US law?", "Why is MITI -- their trade organization -- calling on all Japanese corporations everywhere in the world to exceed by as much as possible the environmental standards of every country in which they're operating?", "Well, maybe they're just dumb about business competition.", "But maybe they know something that George Bush and Dan Quayle don't know -- that the future will call for greater efficiency and greater environmental efficiency.", "This is a value an issue that touches my basic values.", "I'm taught in my religious tradition that we are given dominion over the Earth, but we're required to be good stewards of the Earth, and that means to take care of it.", "We're not doing that now under the Bush-Quayle

to Admiral Stockdale on this.", "But I -- you know, the fact of the matter is that one of the proposals that Senator Gore has suggested is to have the taxpayers of America spend $100 billion a year on environmental projects in foreign countries --", " That's not true --", " Foreign aid -- well, Senator, it's in your book.", "On page 304 --", " No, it's not.", " It is there.", "(APPLAUSE)  It is in your book.", "You know, Hal, I wanted to bring the Gore book tonight, because I figured he was going to pull a Bill Clinton on me and he has.", "Because he's going to disavow what's in his book.", "It's in your book --", " No.", " It comes out to $100 billion of foreign aid for environmental projects.", " Now, how are we going to pay for it?", "How are we going to pay for an extra $100 billion

" There is no such proposal.", "What I have called upon is a cooperative effort by the US and Europe and Asia to work together in opening up new markets throughout the world for the new technologies

right now, not because of their economy, but because they're choking to death on the air pollution.", "They're banning automobiles some days of the week.", "Now what they want is not new laser-guided

believe that we have a mandate --", " -- to try to solve this problem, particularly when we can do it while we create jobs in the process.", " I know it.", "We've got to have a little equal time here

taxes is the way to solve our environmental problems.", "And you talk about the bad situation in the auto industry.", "You seem to say that the answer is, well, I'll just make it that much worse by increasing the CAFE standards.", "Yes, the auto industry is hurting, it's been hurting for a long time, and increasing the CAFE standards to 45 miles per gallon, like you and Bill Clinton are suggesting, will put, as I said, 300,000 people out of work.", " I think it's Admiral Stockdale's.", " Well, we have excellent technical health care, but we don't administer it very well, and the escalating costs top any other budget danger in the -- on the horizon, I think.", "And what Mr Perot has suggested is that we try to re- -to look at the incentives, the incentives that are in our current way of doing business, are what are killing us.", "There's -- there's no incentive for a hypochondriac not to go to the -- to Medicare every day.", "There is no incentive for a doctor to curtail the expensive tests because he's under threat of malpractice lawyers.", "And so we -- we just have a web of wrong-way incentives that has to be changed by some people who are in the medical profession and some other crafty people who know how to write contracts to change incentives or get -- get the -- the incentives situation under control.", " Bill Clinton and I believe that if a criminal has the right to a lawyer, every American family ought to have the right to see a doctor of their own choosing when they need to see a doctor.", "There are almost 40 million Americans who work full time today and yet have no health insurance whatsoever.", "We are proposing to change that, not with a government-run plan, not with new taxes, but with a new approach called managed competition.", "We are going to provide a standard health insurance package provided by private insurance companies and eliminate the duplication and red tape, and overlap, and we're going to have cost controls to eliminate the unnecessary procedures that are costing so much money today.", "There was a bipartisan commission evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats who looked at our plan and the Bush-Quayle proposal.", "They said ours will save tens of billions of dollars and cover every American.", "The Bush proposal, by contrast, will cost us tens of billions and still leave Americans uninsured.", "But what I want to know is, why has George Bush waited for 3 and a half years during this health insurance crisis before finally coming out with a proposal, just before the election, and he still hasn't introduced it in Congress.", "Why the long wait, Dan?", " Hal, President Bush has had his health care reform agenda on Capitol Hill for 8 months.", "He's had parts of it up there for years.", "You talk about increasing costs that the president has had on Capitol Hill- - medical malpractice reform legislation -- for several years.", "Defensive medicine and health care today cost $20.7 billion.", "Defense medicine defined as testing and treatment that is only necessary in case of a law suit.", "Wouldn't that be nice to take $20.7 billion that we're putting into our legal system and put it to preventive health care or women's health care or something else besides trial lawyers?", "But no -- you don't want to reform the health care system to drive down costs through medical malpractice.", "What you're doing -- you are talking about a government program.", "Your program is to ration health care.", "You said in your statement to see a doctor when you want to see a doctor.", "When you start rationing health care there's going to be a waiting line to see a doctor unless it's an emergency.", "Remember when we rationed energy in this country?", "Waiting lines at the gasoline stations.", "The same thing would happen when you ration health care.", "The president's proposal deals with tax credits, deductions and purchasing health care in the private sector and making health care affordable and available to every single American.", " Well, I'm out of ammunition on this --", " Well, let me talk then because I've got a couple of things that I want to say.", " We still didn't get an answer to the question of why George Bush waited for 3 and a half years --", " He didn't wait 3 and a half years.", " -- during the national --", " I did answer the question.", " -- health insurance crisis before he even made a proposal.", "And it still hasn't been submitted to Congress in the form of legislation.", "I also want to respond to the question about malpractice.", "Do you know which state has the lowest malpractice premiums in the entire country?", "Bill Clinton's Arkansas does -- partly because he has passed reform measures limiting the time during which malpractice suits can be filed.", "In fact, tort claims generally have fallen 10 % under Bill Clinton there.", "But you know, that's not the reason for this health insurance crisis.", "The reason is, we've had absolutely no leadership.", "Let me tell you about a friend of mine named Mitch Philpot from Marietta, Georgia -- not far from here -- who Tipper and I met with his family in Johns Hopkins Hospital.", "Their son, Brett, was in the bed next to our son and they couldn't pay their medical bills.", "They used to live in Atlanta, but they lost their house.", "And while they were there, both Mitch and his wife lost their jobs because they could not get unpaid leave.", "We pass legislation to give family leave under circumstances like that, exempting small business.", "How can you talk about family values, Dan, and twice veto the Family Medical Leave Act?", "(APPLAUSE)", " Pass our Family Leave Act, because it goes to small businesses where the major problem is.", "Your proposal excluded small business.", "That's the problem.", "Now, let me talk about health care and --", " Did you require it?", "Did you require it?", " My turn -- (holding hand up at Gore)", " Did you require (inaudible) -- (Simultaneous conversation)", " Lighten\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 up Al.", "My turn.", " It's a free discussion.", " Take a breath, Al.", "Inhale.", " It's a free discussion.", "(APPLAUSE)  Did you require family leave in that legislation?", "Yes or no?", " We offered incentives to small businesses.", "Yes or no --", " That's a no, isn't it?", " Was small business exempted under your proposal?", " Yes.", " Yes.", "And that's where the biggest problem is --", " Did you require it of anyone?", " I'm going to get back to the topic again --", " Did you require it of anyone?", " -- because he obviously doesn't want to talk about health insurance or health care, which you address.", "I was absolutely -- I shouldn't say that -- another Clinton.", "You pulled another Clinton on me because here you go again.", "Medical malpractice legislation has been before the Congress of the US and you tried to convince the American people that Bill Clinton is for tort reform?", "The biggest campaign contributors to your campaign are the trial lawyers of America.", "We have a letter -- and we're going to release it again to the media, if the media is interested -- where the head of the trial lawyers of Arkansas said that Bill Clinton was basically in their back pocket, that Bill Clinton has always opposed tort reform of any kind.", "It's in the letter, we have it, we'll make it available -- because Bill Clinton is not for tort reform.", "I'd like to know where Bill Clinton stands on health insurance.", "When he was campaigning in New Hampshire, he said I am for the pay-or-play health insurance.", "Pay or play, that's a 7 to 9 % payroll tax on every worker in America that participates in this program.", " Can I respond?", " And then, all of a sudden, this summer he says, oh, I'm not for a pay or play.", "Here we go again.", "Bill Clinton, one day he's for pay or play, the next day he's against pay or play.", "He does it in education.", "He writes Polly Williams, a Democrat state legislator in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, saying I'm for choice in education; then he goes to the NEA teachers union and says, sorry, I'm not for choice in education because you won't let me be for choice in education.", "One time Bill Clinton says term limits -- we ought to limit terms, it's ridiculous that a member of Congress can serve for 30, 40, 50 years, and you limit the terms of the president -- but that's another subject.", " We're fixing to limit one.", "(Laughter)", " It's not going to be mine; it's going to be people like you and Kennedy and Metzenbaum and George Mitchell and the rest of that Democratic Congress on Capitol Hill -- that's who we're talking about.", "(APPLAUSE)  And that's who the American people -- as you well know, you've got term limits for a president, you don't have term limits for Congress, and I think it's absolutely ridiculous that we don't.", " I want to respond to some of this.", " Here goes Bill Clinton again: he says, well, term limits, that's an interesting idea, I think I might be in favor of that.", "Then his Democratic friends in Congress say, no, Bill, you can't be for that.", "Bill Clinton has trouble telling the truth.", "You have to tell the truth.", " I want to respond, if I might.", " You know, in response to my question before that long laundry list, he said that they had their own family leave proposal.", "It was just like the proposal of your party back when Social Security was first proposed.", " we're for it as long as it's voluntary.", "Same with Medicare.", " we're for it so long as it's voluntary.", "Civil rights -- we're for it so long as it's voluntary.", " Family leave is important enough to be required.", "(APPLAUSE)", " Bill Clinton and I support the right of a woman to choose.", "(APPLAUSE)  That doesn't mean we're pro-abortion; in fact, we believe there are way too many abortions in this country.", "And the way to reduce them is by reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies, not vetoing family planning legislation the way George Bush has consistently done.", "The reason we are pro-choice and in favor of a woman's right to privacy is because we believe that during the early stages of a pregnancy the government has no business coming in and ordering a woman to do what the government thinks is best.", "What Dan Quayle and George Bush and Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson think is the right decision in a given set of circumstances is their privilege -- but don't have the government order a woman to do what they think is the right thing to do.", "We ought to be able to build more common ground among those who describe themselves as pro-choice and pro-life in efforts to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies.", "But, Dan, you can clear this up very simply by repeating after me: I support the right of a woman to choose.", "Can you say that?", " This issue is an issue that divides Americans deeply.", "I happen to be pro-life.", "I have been pro-life for my 16 years -- (APPLAUSE.)", "-- in public life.", "My objective and the president's objective is to try to reduce abortions in this country.", "We have 1.6 million abortions.", "We have more abortions in Washington, DC, than we do live births.", "Why shouldn't we have more reflection upon the issue before abor -- the decision of abortion is made.", "I would hope that we would agree upon that.", "Something like a 24-hour waiting period, parental notification.", "I was in Los Angeles recently and I talked to a woman who told me that she had an abortion when she was 17 years of age.", "And looking back on that she said it was a mistake.", "She said -- she said I wished at that time, that I was going through this difficult time, that I had counseling to talk about the post-abortion trauma, and talk about adoption rather than abortion.", "Because if I had had that discussion, I would have had the child.", "Let's not forget that every abortion stops a beating heart.", "I think we have far too many abortions in this country, in this country of ours.", " I believe that a woman owns her body and what she does with it is her own business, period.", "(APPLAUSE.)", "Period.", " I don't -- I, too, abhor abortions, but I don't think they should be made illegal, and I don't -- and I don't think it's a political issue.", "I think it's a privacy issue.", "(APPLAUSE.)", " Well, you notice in his response, that Dan did not say I support the right of a woman to choose.", "That is because he and George Bush have turned over their party to Pat Buchanan and Phyllis Schlafly, who have ordered them to endorse a platform which makes all abortions illegal under any circumstances, regardless of what has led to that decision by a woman.", "Even in cases of rape and incest, their platform requires that a woman be penalized, that she not be allowed to make a choice, if she believes, in consultation with her family, her doctor, and others, whoever she chooses, that she wants to have an abortion after rape, or incest.", "They make it completely --", " Senator, do you support a 24-hour waiting period?", " -- illegal under any of those circumstances.", "Now they want to waffle around --", " Do you support a 24-hour waiting period?", " Let me finish this, briefly.", "Now -- now you want to waffle around on it and give the impression that maybe you don't really mean what you say.", "But again, you can clear it up by simply repeating I support the right of a woman to choose.", "Say it.", " Thank you.", "Talk about waffling around.", "This issue is a very important issue.", "It has been debated throughout your public life and throughout my public life, and one thing that I don't think that it is wise to do, and that is to change your position.", "At one time, and most of the time in the House of Representatives, you had a pro-life position.", " That's simply not true.", " In 1987, you wrote a letter, and we'll pass this out to the media --", " That is simply not true.", " You wrote a letter saying that you oppose taxpayer funding of abortion.", "Bill Clinton has the same type of a record.", " In some circumstances.", " You're going to qualify it now.", " And I still do.", " And Bill Clinton, when he was governor of Arkansas, also worked with the Right to Life people and supported Right to Life positions and now he has changed.", "Talk about waffling around.", "This is the typical type of Clinton response.", "Even on the issue like abortion.", "He's on both sides of the issue.", "Take the NAFTA agreement --", " Well, wait --", " How long did he have --", " I know you want to change the subject, Dan, but let's stay on this one for a while.", " How long did he have to wait -- or how quickly did he change his position on education?", "He changes his position all the time.", " Let's stay with this issue for a while.", " Bill Clinton -- Bill Clinton has trouble telling the truth.", "3 words he fears most in the English language.", " Tell the truth.", " Yeah, I want to talk about this, because the question was not about free trade or education.", "The question --", " Talk about waffling.", "You're the one who brought up the --", " Now, I let you talk.", " -- issue of waffling.", "He's waffled on the abortion issue.", " I let you talk.", "Let me talk now.", "It's going to be a long evening if you're like this, now.", " Oh, no, it's not --", " Don't change the subject --", " Don't change the subject --", " Well, answer my questions, then.", " What you have done --", " Answer my questions.", "On the 24 hour waiting period -- do you support that?", " I have had the same position --", " Do you support that?", " I have had the same position on abortion in favor of a woman's right to choose.", "Do you support a woman's right to choose --", " Do you support a 24 hour waiting period to have --", " You're still avoiding --", " How about avoiding the question?", " -- the question.", "Now, wait a minute.", "Let me tell you why this is so important.", "There are millions of women in this country who passionately believe in the right of a woman to privacy.", "And they want to stack the Supreme Court with justices who will take away the right to privacy.", "Make no mistake about it.", "That is their agenda -- (APPLAUSE)  And if you support them, don't be surprised that that is exactly what they want to do and that is why Dan Quayle refuses to say this evening that he supports the right of a woman to choose.", "I agree with Admiral Stockdale and the vast majority of Democrats and Republicans in this country.", "You know, one of the reasons so many Republicans are supporting the Clinton- Gore ticket is because they've turned over the party to this right wing extremist group which takes positions on issues like abortion that don't even allow exceptions for rape and incest.", " Again, can't you just say you support the right of a woman to choose?", " I would like to get in -- I feel like I'm an observer at a pingpong game, where they're talking about well, you know, they're expert professional politicians that massage these intricate plots and know every nuance to 'em.", "And meantime, we're facing a desperate situation in our economy.", "I've seen the cost of living double in my lifetime.", "A new granddaughter was born in my family -- my granddaughter- -3 weeks ago.", "And according to the statistics that we have -- that is, the Perot group -- the chances of her seeing a doubling of the standard of living are nil.", "In fact, her children will be dead before another -- this standard of living is doubled.", "So what the heck!", "Let's get on with talking about something substantive.", "(APPLAUSE)", " We need to get on --", " Just 15 seconds to respond.", " Well, can I have 15 seconds also?", " I'll tell you what.", "If --", " Well, Hal, enterprise zones are important and it's an idea that the president has been pushing, and there's been very strong reluctance on, with the Democratic Congress.", "We'll continue to push it.", "We also want, Hal, to have home ownership.", "I was at a housing sub -- a housing project in San Francisco several months ago and met with people that were trying to reclaim their neighborhood.", "They wanted home ownership.", "They didn't want handouts.", "And I was with the Democrat mayor of San Francisco who was there supporting our idea.", "But when you look at the cities and you see the problems we have with crime, drugs, lack of jobs, I also want to point out one of the fundamental problems that we have in American cities and throughout America today, and that is the breakdown of the American family.", "I know some people laugh about it when I talk about the breakdown of the family, but it's true.", "60 % of the kids that are born in our major cities today are born out of wedlock.", "We have too many divorces.", "We have too many fathers that aren't assuming their responsibility.", "The breakdown of the family is a contributing factor to the problems that we have in urban America.", " I think enterprise zones are good, but I think the problem is deeper than that.", "I think we are -- you know, when I was -- I ran a civilization for several years, a civilization of 3 to 4 hundred wonderful men.", "We had our own laws.", "We had our own, practically our own constitution.", "And I put up -- I was the -- I was the sovereign for a good bit of that.", "And I tried to analyze human predicaments in that microcosm of life in the -- in the world.", "And I found out that when I really got down to putting out do's and don'ts, and lots of these included take torture for this and that, and this and that, and never take any amnesty, for reasons they all understood and went along with.", "But one of the -- we had an acronym, BACKUS, and each one of those B-a-c-k was something for which you -- you had to make them hurt you before you did it.", "Bowing in public, making, making -- getting on the radio and so forth.", "But at the end it was US, BACKUS.", "You got the double meaning there.", "But the US could be called the US, but it was Unity Over Self, Loners Make Out.", "Somehow we're going to have to get some love in this country between races, and between rich and poor.", "You have got to have leaders -- and they're out there -- who can do this with their bare hands, with -- working with, with people on the scene.", " George Bush's urban policy has been a tale of 2 cities: the best of times for the very wealthy; the worst of times for everyone else.", "We have seen a decline in urban America under the Bush-Quayle administration.", "Bill Clinton and I want to change that, by creating good jobs, investing in infrastructure, new programs in job training and apprenticeship, welfare reform -- to say to a mother with young children that if she gets a good job, her children are not going to lose their Medicaid benefits; incentives for investment in the inner city area, and, yes, enterprise zones.", "Vice President Quayle said they're important, but George Bush eliminated them from his urban plan, and then --", " Well, that's not true.", " And then, when they were included in a plan that the Congress passed, --", " We have been for enterprise zones --", " -- George Bush vetoed the enterprise zone law, the law that included them, for one reason: because that same bill raised taxes on those making more than $200,000 a year.", "Let's face up to it, Dan: your top priority really, isn't it, to make sure that the very wealthy don't have to pay any more taxes.", "We want to cut taxes on middle-income families and raise them on those making more than $200,000 a year.", " What plan is that?", " And if we can take our approach, the cities will be much better off.", " What plan is that that's just going to raise taxes on those making over $200,000 a year?", "You may call that your plan, but everyone knows that you simply can't get $150 billion in new taxes by raising the marginal tax rate to a top rate of 36 % and only tax those making $200,000 a year.", "It's absolutely ridiculous.", "The top 2 % which you refer to, that gets you down to $64,000; then you have about a $40-billion shortfall -- that gets you down to $36,000 a year.", "Everybody making more than $36,000 a year will have their taxes increased if Bill Clinton is president of the US.", "And I don't know how you're going to go to urban America and say that raising taxes is good for you.", "I don't know how you're going to go to urban America and say, well, the best thing that we can offer is simply to raise taxes again.", "This is nothing more than a tax-and-spend platform.", "We've seen it before.", "It doesn't work.", "Let me tell you about a story.", " Can I respond to some of that?", " I've got a very good example --", " Can I respond to some of that?", " -- when we talk about families here, because I was meeting with some former gang members in Phoenix and Los Angeles and Albuquerque, New Mexico.", "And when I talked to those former gang members, here's what they told me why they joined the gang.", "They said, well, joining a gang is like joining a family.", "I said, joining a family?", "Yes, because the gang offered support, it offered leadership, it offered comfort, it was a way to get ahead.", "Where have we come if joining a gang is like being a member of the family?", " And that's why I think that families have to be strengthened, and you don't strengthen the American family by raising taxes.", " I do want to respond to that.", " George Bush and Dan Quayle want to protect the very wealthy.", "That is the group that has gotten all of the tax cuts under the Bush-Quayle administration.", "Nobody here who is middle income has gotten a tax cut because middle-income families have had tax increases under Bush and Quayle in order to finance the cuts for the very wealthy.", "That's what trickle-down economics is all about.", "And they want to continue it.", "We're proposing to also require foreign corporations to pay the same taxes that American corporations do when they do business here in the US of America.", "George Bush has not been willing to enforce the laws and collect those taxes.", "We want to close that loophole and raise more money in that way.", " Excuse me?", " All right.", "Well, he, he talked about ways to raise money to help the cities.", "What we're proposing is to invest in the infrastructure in cities and have targeted tax incentives for investment right in inner city areas.", "The enterprise zones represent a part of our proposal also, and strengthening the family through welfare reform.", "And you know the Bush administration has cut out -- has vetoed family leave, they have cut childhood immunization and college aid.", "If you don't support parents and you don't support children, how -- how can you say you support families?", " How about supporting parents and the right to choose where their kids go to school, Al?", "(APPLAUSE.)", "Do you support that?", " We --", " Let the parents -- let the parents --", " Do you want me to answer?", " -- public or private schools?", " Want me to answer?", " We support the public school choice to go to any public school of your choice.", "What we don't support -- and listen to what they're proposing -- to take US taxpayer dollars and subsidize private schools.", "Now I'm all for private schools, but to use taxpayer dollars, when the people who get these little vouchers often won't be able to afford the private school anyway, and the private school is not --", " Al, I think, I think it's important --", " -- under any obligation to admit them, that is a ripoff of the US taxpayer.", " That's important.", "This is a very- -this is a very important issue.", "Choice in education is a very important issue.", " And he said that he was not for choosing -- giving the parents the right to choose to send their children to public schools.", "But it's okay for the wealthy to choose to send their kids to private schools, but it's not okay for the middle class and the working poor to choose where they want to send their kids to school.", "I think that it's time that all parents in America have a right to choose where they send their kids to school to get an education.", "(APPLAUSE.)", " I -- I come down on the side of freedom of school choice.", "The -- and there's a lot of misunderstandings that I've heard here tonight, that I may have the answer to.", "The -- starting at, you know, for the last, almost a decade, we've worried about our schools officially through Washington, and the president had a meeting of all the governors, and then they tried the conventional fixes for schools, that is, to increase the certification of -- requirements for the teachers, to lengthen the school day, to lengthen the school year and nothing -- this is a very brief overview of the thing -- but nothing happened.", "And it's time to change the school's structure.", "In schools, bureaucracy is bad and autonomy is good.", "The only good schools -- (APPLAUSE.)", "-- we have are those run by talented principals and devoted teachers, and they're running their own show.", "How many times have I thrived?", "You know, the best thing I had when I ran that civilization, it succeeded, and it's a landmark.", "The best thing I had going for me was I had no contact with Washington for all those years.", "(APPLAUSE.)", " Could I respond?", " You know, I didn't have my hearing aid turned on.", "Tell me again.", "(Laughter)", " Nasty attacks -- well, I think there is a case to be made for putting emphasis on character over these issues that we've been batting back and forth and have a life of their own.", "Sure, you have to know where you're going with your government, but character is the big variable in the success.", "Character of the leaders is the big variable in the success -- long term success -- of an administration.", "I went to a friend of mine in New York some years ago and he was a president of a major TV network and he said, you know, I think we have messed up this whole -- this election process -- it was an election year -- by stressing that -- putting out the dogma that issues are the thing to talk about, not character.", "He said, I felt so strongly about this, I went back and read the Lincoln-Douglas debates.", "Read those debates.", "How do they come down?", "Douglas is all character.", "He knows all of the little stinky numbers these guys do.", "Abraham Lincoln had character.", "Thank God we got the right president in the Civil War.", "But that is a question that is a valid one, and you know, I would like to brag about the character of my boss.", " This election is about the future of our country, not about personal attacks against one candidate or another.", "Our nation is in trouble and it is appalling to me that with 10 million Americans out work, with the rest working harder for less money than they did 4 years ago, with the loss of 1.4 million manufacturing jobs in our nation, with the health care crisis, a crisis of crime and drugs and AIDS, substandard education, that George Bush would constantly try to level personal attacks at his opponent.", "Now, this, of course, just reached a new low last week when he resorted to a classic McCarthyite technique of trying to smear Bill Clinton over a trip that he took as a student along with lots of other Rhodes Scholars who were invited to go to Russia.", "It's a classic McCarthyite smear technique.", "I think the president of the US ought to apologize.", "I think that he insulted the intelligence of the American people and I'm awful proud that the American people rejected that tactic so overwhelmingly that he decided he had made a mistake.", "Do you think it was a mistake, too, Dan?", " Let me answer the question.", " Hal, you said -- and I wrote it down here -- \"personal negative attacks.\"", "(Laughs) Has anyone been reading my press clippings for the last 4 years?", "(APPLAUSE)  But I happen to -- I agree with one thing on -- with Senator Gore, and that is that we ought to look to the future, and the future is, who's going to be the next president of the US.", "And is it a negative attack and a personal attack to point out that Bill Clinton simply has trouble telling the truth?", "He said that he didn't even demonstrate -- he told the people in Arkansas in 1978.", "Then we find out he organized demonstrations.", "You know, I don't care whether he demonstrated or didn't demonstrate.", "The fact -- the question is, tell the truth.", "Just tell us the truth.", "Today, Bill Clinton -- excuse me -- yesterday in Philadelphia on a radio show, just yesterday on a radio show, he attacked -- Admiral, he attacks Ross Perot saying the media is giving Ross Perot a free ride.", "The press asked him when the klieg lights are on, said what do you mean by Ross Perot getting a free ride?", "He says I didn't say that at all.", "I mean, you can't have it both ways.", "No, I don't think that is a personal attack.", "What I find troubling with Bill Clinton is he can't tell the truth.", "You cannot lead this great country of ours by misleading the people.", "(APPLAUSE)", " I think the best justification for getting Ross Perot in the race again to stay is that we're seeing this kind of chit-chat back and forth about issues that don't concentrate on where our grandchildren -- the living standards of our children and grandchildren.", "He is, as I have read in more than one article, a revolutionary; he's got plans out there that are going to double the speed at which this budget problem is being cared for.", "It was asked how, if we would squeeze down so fast that we would strangle the economy in the process.", "That is an art, to follow all those variables and know when to let up and to nurse this economy back together with pulls and pushes.", "And there's no better man in the world to do that than that old artist, Ross Perot.", "And so I think that my closing statement is that I think I'm in a room with people that aren't the life of reality.", "The US is in deep trouble.", "We've got to have somebody that can get up there and bring out the firehoses and get it stopped, and that's what we're about in the Perot campaign.", " Three weeks from today, our nation will make a fateful decision.", "We can continue traveling the road we have been on, which has led to higher unemployment and worse economic times, or we can reach out for change.", "If we choose change, it will require us to reach down inside ourselves to find the courage to take a new direction.", "Sometimes it seems deceptively easy to continue with the old habits even when they're no longer good for us.", "Trickle-down economics simply does not work.", "We have had an increase in all of the things that should be decreasing.", "Everything that should have been increasing has been going down.", "We have got to change direction.", "Bill Clinton offers a new approach.", "He has been named by the other 49 governors, Republicans and Democrats alike, as the best and most effective governor in the entire US of America.", "He's moved 17,000 people off the welfare rolls and on to payrolls.", "He has introduced innovations in health care and education, and again, he has led the nation for the last 2 years in a row in the creation of jobs in the private sector.", "Isn't it time for a new approach, a new generation of ideas and leadership, to put our nation's people first and to get our economy moving again?", "We simply cannot stand to continue with this failed approach that is no good for us.", "Ultimately, it is a choice between hope and fear, a choice between the future and the past.", "It is time to reach out for a better nation.", "We are bigger than George Bush has told us we are, as a nation, and we have a much brighter future.", "Give us a chance.", "With your help, we'll change this country and we can't wait to get started.", "(APPLAUSE.)", " Thank you, Hal.", "I'd like to use this closing statement to talk to you about a few people that I have met in these last 4 years.", "I think of a woman in Chicago when I was talking to parents about education where she stood up and said I'm sick and tired of these schools in this city being nothing but a factory for failure.", "And that's why we support choice in education.", "I was in Beaumont, Texas, and met with small business people, and they wanted to reform the civil justice system because they think our legal system costs too much and there's too much of a delay in getting an answer.", "I was in Middletown, Ohio, talking to a welfare woman, where she said I want to go back to work and I had a job offered to me but I'm not going to take it because I have 2 children at home and the job that is offered to me doesn't have health insurance.", "Under President Bush's health care reform package that woman won't have to make a choice about going back to work or health care for her children, because she'll have both.", "I was in Vilnius, Lithuania, Independence Square, speaking to 10,000 people in the middle of winter.", "Hundreds of people came up to me and said: God bless America.", "Yes, in the next 4 years, as I said, somewhere, some time, there's going to be a crisis, and you need to have a president that is qualified, has the experience, and has been tested.", "Not one time during this evening, during 90 minutes, did Al Gore tell us why Bill Clinton is qualified to be president.", "He never answered my charges that Bill Clinton has trouble telling the truth.", "The choice is yours.", "The American people should demand that their president tell the truth.", "Do you really believe -- do you really believe Bill Clinton will tell the truth?", "And do you, do you trust Bill Clinton to be your president?", "(APPLAUSE)", " Yes, I do.", "But before I answer further, let me thank you for moderating.", "I want to thank the University of Miami for hosting us.", "And I know the president will join me in welcoming all of Florida to this debate.", "You've been through the roughest weeks anybody could imagine.", "Our hearts go out to you.", "And we admire your pluck and perseverance.", "I can make American safer than President Bush has made us.", "And I believe President Bush and I both love our country equally.", "But we just have a different set of convictions about how you make America safe.", "I believe America is safest and strongest when we are leading the world and we are leading strong alliances.", "I'll never give a veto to any country over our security.", "But I also know how to lead those alliances.", "This president has left them in shatters across the globe, and we're now 90 percent of the casualties in Iraq and 90 percent of the costs.", "I think that's wrong, and I think we can do better.", "I have a better plan for homeland security.", "I have a better plan to be able to fight the war on terror by strengthening our military, strengthening our intelligence, by going after the financing more authoritatively, by doing what we need to do to rebuild the alliances, by reaching out to the Muslim world, which the president has almost not done, and beginning to isolate the radical Islamic Muslims, not have them isolate the United States of America.", "I know I can do a better job in Iraq.", "I have a plan to have a summit with all of the allies, something this president has not yet achieved, not yet been able to do to bring people to the table.", "We can do a better job of training the Iraqi forces to defend themselves, and I know that we can do a better job of preparing for elections.", "All of these, and especially homeland security, which we'll talk about a little bit later.", " I, too, thank the University of Miami, and say our prayers are with the good people of this state, who've suffered a lot.", "September the 11th changed how America must look at the world.", "And since that day, our nation has been on a multi-pronged strategy to keep our country safer.", "We pursued Al Qaida wherever Al Qaida tries to hide.", "Seventy-five percent of known Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice.", "The rest of them know we're after them.", "We've upheld the doctrine that said if you harbor a terrorist, you're equally as guilty as the terrorist.", "And the Taliban are no longer in power.", "Ten million people have registered to vote in Afghanistan in the upcoming presidential election.", "In Iraq, we saw a threat, and we realized that after September the 11th, we must take threats seriously, before they fully materialize.", "Saddam Hussein now sits in a prison cell.", "America and the world are safer for it.", "We continue to pursue our policy of disrupting those who proliferate weapons of mass destruction.", "Libya has disarmed.", "The A.Q.", "Khan network has been brought to justice.", "And, as well, we're pursuing a strategy of freedom around the world, because I understand free nations will reject terror.", "Free nations will answer the hopes and aspirations of their people.", "Free nations will help us achieve the peace we all want.", " No, I don't believe it's going to happen.", "I believe I'm going to win, because the American people know I know how to lead.", "I've shown the American people I know how to lead.", "I have -- I understand everybody in this country doesn't agree with the decisions I've made.", "And I made some tough decisions.", "But people know where I stand.", "People out there listening know what I believe.", "And that's how best it is to keep the peace.", "This nation of ours has got a solemn duty to defeat this ideology of hate.", "And that's what they are.", "This is a group of killers who will not only kill here, but kill children in Russia, that'll attack unmercifully in Iraq, hoping to shake our will.", "We have a duty to defeat this enemy.", "We have a duty to protect our children and grandchildren.", "The best way to defeat them is to never waver, to be strong, to use every asset at our disposal, is to constantly stay on the offensive and, at the same time, spread liberty.", "And that's what people are seeing now is happening in Afghanistan.", "Ten million citizens have registered to vote.", "It's a phenomenal statistic.", "That if given a chance to be free, they will show up at the polls.", "Forty-one percent of those 10 million are women.", "In Iraq, no doubt about it, it's tough.", "It's hard work.", "It's incredibly hard.", "You know why?", "Because an enemy realizes the stakes.", "The enemy understands a free Iraq will be a major defeat in their ideology of hatred.", "That's why they're fighting so vociferously.", "They showed up in Afghanistan when they were there, because they tried to beat us and they didn't.", "And they're showing up in Iraq for the same reason.", "They're trying to defeat us.", "And if we lose our will, we lose.", "But if we remain strong and resolute, we will defeat this enemy.", " I believe in being strong and resolute and determined.", "And I will hunt down and kill the terrorists, wherever they are.", "But we also have to be smart, Jim.", "And smart means not diverting your attention from the real war on terror in Afghanistan against Osama bin Laden and taking if off to Iraq where the 9/11 Commission confirms there was no connection to 9/11 itself and Saddam Hussein, and where the reason for going to war was weapons of mass destruction, not the removal of Saddam Hussein.", "This president has made, I regret to say, a colossal error of judgment.", "And judgment is what we look for in the president of the United States of America.", "I'm proud that important military figures who are supporting me in this race: former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili; just yesterday, General Eisenhower's son, General John Eisenhower, endorsed me; General Admiral William Crown; General Tony McBeak, who ran the Air Force war so effectively for his father -- all believe I would make a stronger commander in chief.", "And they believe it because they know I would not take my eye off of the goal: Osama bin Laden.", "Unfortunately, he escaped in the mountains of Tora Bora.", "We had him surrounded.", "But we didn't use American forces, the best trained in the world, to go kill him.", "The president relied on Afghan warlords and he outsourced that job too.", "That's wrong.", " Well, where do you want me to begin?", "First of all, he made the misjudgment of saying to America that he was going to build a true alliance, that he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through the inspections.", "In fact, he first didn't even want to do that.", "And it wasn't until former Secretary of State Jim Baker and General Scowcroft and others pushed publicly and said you've got to go to the U.N., that the president finally changed his mind -- his campaign has a word for that -- and went to the United Nations.", "Now, once there, we could have continued those inspections.", "We had Saddam Hussein trapped.", "He also promised America that he would go to war as a last resort.", "Those words mean something to me, as somebody who has been in combat.", "\"Last resort.\"", "You've got to be able to look in the eyes of families and say to those parents, \"I tried to do everything in my power to prevent the loss of your son and daughter.\"", "I don't believe the United States did that.", "And we pushed our allies aside.", "And so, today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the cost: $200 billion -- $200 billion that could have been used for health care, for schools, for construction, for prescription drugs for seniors, and it's in Iraq.", "And Iraq is not even the center of the focus of the war on terror.", "The center is Afghanistan, where, incidentally, there were more Americans killed last year than the year before; where the opium production is 75 percent of the world's opium production; where 40 to 60 percent of the economy of Afghanistan is based on opium; where the elections have been postponed three times.", "The president moved the troops, so he's got 10 times the number of troops in Iraq than he has in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is.", "Does that mean that Saddam Hussein was 10 times more important than Osama bin Laden -- than, excuse me, Saddam Hussein more important than Osama bin Laden?", "I don't think so.", " My opponent looked at the same intelligence I looked at and declared in 2002 that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat.", "He also said in December of 2003 that anyone who doubts that the world is safer without Saddam Hussein does not have the judgment to be president.", "I agree with him.", "The world is better off without Saddam Hussein.", "I was hoping diplomacy would work.", "I understand the serious consequences of committing our troops into harm's way.", "It's the hardest decision a president makes.", "So I went to the United Nations.", "I didn't need anybody to tell me to go to the United Nations.", "I decided to go there myself.", "And I went there hoping that, once and for all, the free world would act in concert to get Saddam Hussein to listen to our demands.", "They passed the resolution that said, \"Disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences.\"", "I believe, when an international body speaks, it must mean what it says.", "Saddam Hussein had no intention of disarming.", "Why should he?", "He had 16 other resolutions and nothing took place.", "As a matter of fact, my opponent talks about inspectors.", "The facts are that he was systematically deceiving the inspectors.", "That wasn't going to work.", "That's kind of a pre-September 10th mentality, the hope that somehow resolutions and failed inspections would make this world a more peaceful place.", "He was hoping we'd turn away.", "But there was fortunately others beside myself who believed that we ought to take action.", "We did.", "The world is safer without Saddam Hussein.", " Jim, we've got the capability of doing both.", "As a matter of fact, this is a global effort.", "We're facing a group of folks who have such hatred in their heart, they'll strike anywhere, with any means.", "And that's why it's essential that we have strong alliances, and we do.", "That's why it's essential that we make sure that we keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of people like Al Qaida, which we are.", "But to say that there's only one focus on the war on terror doesn't really understand the nature of the war on terror.", "Of course we're after Saddam Hussein -- I mean bin Laden.", "He's isolated.", "Seventy-five percent of his people have been brought to justice.", "The killer -- the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, is in prison.", "We're making progress.", "But the front on this war is more than just one place.", "The Philippines -- we've got help -- we're helping them there to bring -- to bring Al Qaida affiliates to justice there.", "And, of course, Iraq is a central part in the war on terror.", "That's why Zarqawi and his people are trying to fight us.", "Their hope is that we grow weary and we leave.", "The biggest disaster that could happen is that we not succeed in Iraq.", "We will succeed.", "We've got a plan to do so.", "And the main reason we'll succeed is because the Iraqis want to be free.", "I had the honor of visiting with Prime Minister Allawi.", "He's a strong, courageous leader.", "He believes in the freedom of the Iraqi people.", "He doesn't want U.S. leadership, however, to send mixed signals, to not stand with the Iraqi people.", "He believes, like I believe, that the Iraqis are ready to fight for their own freedom.", "They just need the help to be trained.", "There will be elections in January.", "We're spending reconstruction money.", "And our alliance is strong.", "That's the plan for victory.", "And when Iraq if free, America will be more secure.", " The president just talked about Iraq as a center of the war on terror.", "Iraq was not even close to the center of the war on terror before the president invaded it.", "The president made the judgment to divert forces from under General Tommy Franks from Afghanistan before the Congress even approved it to begin to prepare to go to war in Iraq.", "And he rushed the war in Iraq without a plan to win the peace.", "Now, that is not the judgment that a president of the United States ought to make.", "You don't take America to war unless have the plan to win the peace.", "You don't send troops to war without the body armor that they need.", "I've met kids in Ohio, parents in Wisconsin places, Iowa, where they're going out on the Internet to get the state-of-the-art body gear to send to their kids.", "Some of them got it for a birthday present.", "I think that's wrong.", "Humvees -- 10,000 out of 12,000 Humvees that are over there aren't armored.", "And you go visit some of those kids in the hospitals today who were maimed because they don't have the armament.", "This president just -- I don't know if he sees what's really happened over there.", "But it's getting worse by the day.", "More soldiers killed in June than before.", "More in July than June.", "More in August than July.", "More in September than in August.", "And now we see beheadings.", "And we got weapons of mass destruction crossing the border every single day, and they're blowing people up.", "And we don't have enough troops there.", " Can I respond to that?", " Thank you, sir.", "First of all, what my opponent wants you to forget is that he voted to authorize the use of force and now says it's the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place.", "I don't see how you can lead this country to succeed in Iraq if you say wrong war, wrong time, wrong place.", "What message does that send our troops?", "What message does that send to our allies?", "What message does that send the Iraqis?", "No, the way to win this is to be steadfast and resolved and to follow through on the plan that I've just outlined.", " Yes, we have to be steadfast and resolved, and I am.", "And I will succeed for those troops, now that we're there.", "We have to succeed.", "We can't leave a failed Iraq.", "But that doesn't mean it wasn't a mistake of judgment to go there and take the focus off of Osama bin Laden.", "It was.", "Now, we can succeed.", "But I don't believe this president can.", "I think we need a president who has the credibility to bring the allies back to the table and to do what's necessary to make it so America isn't doing this alone.", " Jim, let me tell you exactly what I'll do.", "And there are a long list of thing.", "First of all, what kind of mixed message does it send when you have $500 million going over to Iraq to put police officers in the streets of Iraq, and the president is cutting the COPS program in America?", "What kind of message does it send to be sending money to open firehouses in Iraq, but we're shutting firehouses who are the first- responders here in America.", "The president hasn't put one nickel, not one nickel into the effort to fix some of our tunnels and bridges and most exposed subway systems.", "That's why they had to close down the subway in New York when the Republican Convention was there.", "We hadn't done the work that ought to be done.", "The president -- 95 percent of the containers that come into the ports, right here in Florida, are not inspected.", "Civilians get onto aircraft, and their luggage is X-rayed, but the cargo hold is not X- rayed.", "Does that make you feel safer in America?", "This president thought it was more important to give the wealthiest people in America a tax cut rather than invest in homeland security.", "Those aren't my values.", "I believe in protecting America first.", "And long before President Bush and I get a tax cut -- and that's who gets it -- long before we do, I'm going to invest in homeland security and I'm going to make sure we're not cutting COPS programs in America and we're fully staffed in our firehouses and that we protect the nuclear and chemical plants.", "The president also unfortunately gave in to the chemical industry, which didn't want to do some of the things necessary to strengthen our chemical plant exposure.", "And there's an enormous undone job to protect the loose nuclear materials in the world that are able to get to terrorists.", "That's a whole other subject, but I see we still have a little bit more time.", "Let me just quickly say, at the current pace, the president will not secure the loose material in the Soviet Union -- former Soviet Union for 13 years.", "I'm going to do it in four years.", "And we're going to keep it out of the hands of terrorists.", " I don't think we want to get to how he's going to pay for all these promises.", "It's like a huge tax gap.", "Anyway, that's for another debate.", "My administration has tripled the amount of money we're spending on homeland security to $30 billion a year.", "My administration worked with the Congress to create the Department of Homeland Security so we could better coordinate our borders and ports.", "We've got 1,000 extra border patrol on the southern border; want 1,000 on the northern border.", "We're modernizing our borders.", "We spent $3.1 billion for fire and police, $3.1 billion.", "We're doing our duty to provide the funding.", "But the best way to protect this homeland is to stay on the offense.", "You know, we have to be right 100 percent of the time.", "And the enemy only has to be right once to hurt us.", "There's a lot of good people working hard.", "And by the way, we've also changed the culture of the FBI to have counterterrorism as its number one priority.", "We're communicating better.", "We're going to reform our intelligence services to make sure that we get the best intelligence possible.", "The Patriot Act is vital -- is vital that the Congress renew the Patriot Act which enables our law enforcement to disrupt terror cells.", "But again, I repeat to my fellow citizens, the best way to protection is to stay on the offense.", " The president just said the FBI had changed its culture.", "We just read on the front pages of America's papers that there are over 100,000 hours of tapes, unlistened to.", "On one of those tapes may be the enemy being right the next time.", "And the test is not whether you're spending more money.", "The test is, are you doing everything possible to make America safe?", "We didn't need that tax cut.", "America needed to be safe.", " Of course we're doing everything we can to protect America.", "I wake up every day thinking about how best to protect America.", "That's my job.", "I work with Director Mueller of the FBI; comes in my office when I'm in Washington every morning, talking about how to protect us.", "There's a lot of really good people working hard to do so.", "It's hard work.", "But, again, I want to tell the American people, we're doing everything we can at home, but you better have a president who chases these terrorists down and bring them to justice before they hurt us again.", " Let me first tell you that the best way for Iraq to be safe and secure is for Iraqi citizens to be trained to do the job.", "And that's what we're doing.", "We've got 100,000 trained now, 125,000 by the end of this year, 200,000 by the end of next year.", "That is the best way.", "We'll never succeed in Iraq if the Iraqi citizens do not want to take matters into their own hands to protect themselves.", "I believe they want to.", "Prime Minister Allawi believes they want to.", "And so the best indication about when we can bring our troops home -- which I really want to do, but I don't want to do so for the sake of bringing them home; I want to do so because we've achieved an objective -- is to see the Iraqis perform and to see the Iraqis step up and take responsibility.", "And so, the answer to your question is: When our general is on the ground and Ambassador Negroponte tells me that Iraq is ready to defend herself from these terrorists, that elections will have been held by then, that their stability and that they're on their way to, you know, a nation that's free; that's when.", "And I hope it's as soon as possible.", "But I know putting artificial deadlines won't work.", "My opponent at one time said, \"Well, get me elected, I'll have them out of there in six months.\"", "You can't do that and expect to win the war on terror.", "My message to our troops is, \"Thank you for what you're doing.", "We're standing with you strong.", "We'll give you all the equipment you need.", "And we'll get you home as soon as the mission's done, because this is a vital mission.\"", "A free Iraq will be an ally in the war on terror, and that's essential.", "A free Iraq will set a powerful example in the part of the world that is desperate for freedom.", "A free Iraq will help secure Israel.", "A free Iraq will enforce the hopes and aspirations of the reformers in places like Iran.", "A free Iraq is essential for the security of this country.", " Thank you, Jim.", "My message to the troops is also: Thank you for what they're doing, but it's also help is on the way.", "I believe those troops deserve better than what they are getting today.", "You know, it's interesting.", "When I was in a rope line just the other day, coming out here from Wisconsin, a couple of young returnees were in the line, one active duty, one from the Guard.", "And they both looked at me and said: We need you.", "You've got to help us over there.", "Now I believe there's a better way to do this.", "You know, the president's father did not go into Iraq, into Baghdad, beyond Basra.", "And the reason he didn't is, he said -- he wrote in his book -- because there was no viable exit strategy.", "And he said our troops would be occupiers in a bitterly hostile land.", "That's exactly where we find ourselves today.", "There's a sense of American occupation.", "The only building that was guarded when

the brave leader of Iraq.", "One of his campaign people alleged that Prime Minister Allawi was like a puppet.", "That's no way to treat somebody who's courageous and brave, that is trying to lead his country forward.", "The way to make sure that we succeed is to send consistent, sound messages to the Iraqi people that when we give our word, we will keep our word, that we stand with you, that we believe you want to be free.", "And I do.", "I believe that 25 million people, the vast majority, long to have elections.", "I reject this notion -- and I'm suggesting my opponent isn't -- I reject

same of what we see today; worst-case scenario, civil war.", "I can do better.", " Yes, let me...", " The reason why Prime Minister Allawi said they're coming across the border is because he recognizes that this is a central part of the war on terror.", "They're fighting us because they're fighting freedom.", "They understand that a free Afghanistan or a free Iraq will be a major defeat for them.", "And those are the stakes.", "And that's why it is essential we not leave.", "That's why it's essential we hold the line.", "That's why it's essential we win.", "And we will.", "Under my

get, believe me.", "And I would hope to never have to use force.", "But by speaking clearly and sending messages that we mean what we say, we've affected the world in a positive way.", "Look at Libya.", "Libya was a threat.", "Libya is now peacefully dismantling its weapons programs.", "Libya understood that America and others will enforce doctrine and that the world is better for it.", "So

the job to Afghan warlords, who only a week earlier had been on the other side fighting against us, neither of whom trusted each other.", "That's the enemy that attacked us.", "That's the enemy that was allowed to walk out of those mountains.", "That's the enemy that is now in 60 countries, with stronger recruits.", "He also said Saddam Hussein would have been stronger.", "That is just factually incorrect.", "Two-thirds of the country was a no-fly zone when we started this war.", "We would have had sanctions.", "We would have had the U.N. inspectors.", "Saddam Hussein would have been

more will it take to get you to join us?\"", "we'd be in a stronger place today.", " First of all, of course I know Osama bin Laden attacked us.", "I know that.", "And secondly, to think that another round of resolutions would have caused Saddam Hussein to disarm, disclose, is ludicrous, in my judgment.", "It just shows a significant difference of opinion.", "We tried diplomacy.", "We did our best.", "He was hoping to turn a blind eye.", "And, yes, he would have been stronger had we not dealt with him.", "He had the capability of making weapons, and he would have made weapons.", "

most serious, sort of, reversals or mixed messages that you could possibly send.", " Right.", " Both.", "I want bilateral talks which put all of the issues, from the armistice of 1952, the economic issues, the human rights issues, the artillery disposal issues, the DMZ issues and the nuclear issues on the table.", " The minute we have bilateral talks, the six-party talks will unwind.", "That's

saying send American troops in at this point is severalfold.", "Number one, we can do this through the African Union, providing we give them the logistical support.", "Right now all the president is providing is humanitarian support.", "We need to do more than that.", "They've got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing.", "And that's going to require more than is on the table today.", "I also believe that it is -- one of the reasons we can't do it is we're overextended.", "Ask the people in the armed forces today.", "We've got Guards and Reserves who are doing double duties.", "We've got a backdoor draft taking place in America today: people with stop-loss programs where they're told you can't get out of the military; nine out of our 10 active duty divisions committed to Iraq one way or the other, either going, coming or preparing.", "So this is the way the president has overextended the United States.", "That's why, in my plan, I add two active duty divisions to the United States Army, not for Iraq, but for our general demands across the globe.", "I also intend to double the number of special forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect fighting the terrorists around the world.", "And if we do that, then we have the ability to be able to respond more rapidly.", "But I'll tell you this, as president, if it took American forces to some degree to coalesce the African Union, I'd be prepared to do it because we could never allow another Rwanda.", "It's a moral responsibility for us and the world.", " Back to Iran, just for a second.", "It was not my administration that put the sanctions on Iran.", "That happened long before I arrived in Washington, D.C.", "In terms of Darfur, I agree it's genocide.", "And Colin Powell so stated.", "We have committed $200 million worth of aid.", "We're the leading donor in the world to help the suffering people there.", "We will commit more over time to help.", "We were very much involved at the U.N. on the sanction policy of the Bashir government in the Sudan.", "Prior to Darfur, Ambassador Jack Danforth had been negotiating a north-south agreement that we would have hoped would have brought peace to the Sudan.", "I agree with my opponent that we shouldn't be committing troops.", "We ought to be working with the African Union to do so -- precisely what we did in Liberia.", "We helped stabilize the situation with some troops, and when the African Union came, we moved them out.", "My hope is that the African Union moves rapidly to help save lives.", "And fortunately the rainy season will be ending shortly, which will make it easier to get aid there and help the long-suffering people there.", " That's a loaded question.", "Well, first of all, I admire Senator Kerry's service to our country.", "I admire the fact that he is a great dad.", "I appreciate the fact that his daughters have been so kind to my daughters in what has been a pretty hard experience for, I guess, young girls, seeing their dads out there campaigning.", "I admire the fact that he served for 20 years in the Senate.", "Although I'm not so sure I admire the record.", "I won't hold it against him that he went to Yale.", "There's nothing wrong with that.", "My concerns about the senator is that, in the course of this campaign, I've been listening very carefully to what he says, and he changes positions on the war in Iraq.", "He changes positions on something as fundamental as what you believe in your core, in your heart of hearts, is right in Iraq.", "You cannot lead if you send mixed messages.", "Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our troops.", "Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our allies.", "Mixed messages send the wrong signals to the Iraqi citizens.", "And that's my biggest concern about my opponent.", "I admire his service.", "But I just know how this world works, and that in the councils of government, there must be certainty from the U.S. president.", "Of course, we change tactics when need to, but we never change our beliefs, the strategic beliefs that are necessary to protect this country in the world.", " Well, first of all, I appreciate enormously the personal comments the president just made.", "And I share them with him.", "I think only if you're doing this -- and he's done it more than I have in terms of the presidency -- can you begin to get a sense of what it means to your families.", "And it's tough.", "And so I acknowledge that his daughters -- I've watched them.", "I've chuckled a few times at some of their comments.", "(LAUGHTER)  And...", " I'm trying to put a leash on them.", "(LAUGHTER)", " Well, I know.", "I've learned not to do that.", "(LAUGHTER)  And I have great respect and admiration for his wife.", "I think she's a terrific person...", " Thank you.", " ... and a great first lady.", "But we do have differences.", "I'm not going to talk about a difference of character.", "I don't think that's my job or my business.", "But let me talk about something that the president just sort of finished up with.", "Maybe someone would call it a character trait, maybe somebody wouldn't.", "But this issue of certainty.", "It's one thing to be certain, but you can be certain and be wrong.", "It's another to be certain and be right, or to be certain and be moving in the right direction, or be certain about a principle and then learn new facts and take those new facts and put them to use in order to change and get your policy right.", "What I worry about with the president is that he's not acknowledging what's on the ground, he's not acknowledging the realities of North Korea, he's not acknowledging the truth of the science of stem-cell research or of global warming and other issues.", "And certainty sometimes can get you in trouble.", " Well, I think -- listen, I fully agree that one should shift tactics, and we will, in Iraq.", "Our commanders have got all the flexibility to do what is necessary to succeed.", "But what I won't do is change my core values because of politics or because of pressure.", "And it is one of the things I've learned in the White House, is that there's enormous pressure on the president, and he cannot wilt under that pressure.", "Otherwise, the world won't be better off.", " I have no intention of wilting.", "I've never wilted in my life.", "And I've never wavered in my life.", "I know exactly what we need to do in Iraq, and my position has been consistent: Saddam Hussein is a threat.", "He needed to be disarmed.", "We needed to go to the U.N.", "The president needed the authority to use force in order to be able to get him to do something, because he never did it without the threat of force.", "But we didn't need to rush to war without a plan to win the peace.", " Nuclear proliferation.", "Nuclear proliferation.", "There's some 600-plus tons of unsecured material still in the former Soviet Union and Russia.", "At the rate that the president is currently securing it, it'll take 13 years to get it.", "I did a lot of work on this.", "I wrote a book about it several years ago -- six, seven years ago -- called \"The New War,\" which saw the difficulties of this international criminal network.", "And back then, we intercepted a suitcase in a Middle Eastern country with nuclear materials in it.", "And the black market sale price was about $250 million.", "Now, there are terrorists trying to get their hands on that stuff today.", "And this president, I regret to say, has secured less nuclear material in the last two years since 9/11 than we did in the two years preceding 9/11.", "We have to do this job.", "And to do the job, you can't cut the money for it.", "The president actually cut the money for it.", "You have to put the money into it and the funding and the leadership.", "And part of that leadership is sending the right message to places like North Korea.", "Right now the president is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunker-busting nuclear weapons.", "The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons.", "It doesn't make sense.", "You talk about mixed messages.", "We're telling other people, \"You can't have nuclear weapons,\" but we're pursuing a new nuclear weapon that we might even contemplate using.", "Not this president.", "I'm going to shut that program down, and we're going to make it clear to the world we're serious about containing nuclear proliferation.", "And we're going to get the job of containing all of that nuclear material in Russia done in four years.", "And we're going to build the strongest international network to prevent nuclear proliferation.", "This is the scale of what President Kennedy set out to do with the nuclear test ban treaty.", "It's our generation's equivalent.", "And I intend to get it done.", " Actually, we've increased funding for dealing with nuclear proliferation about 35 percent since I've been the president.", "Secondly, we've set up what's called the -- well, first of all, I agree with my opponent that the biggest threat facing this country is weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a terrorist network.", "And that's why proliferation is one of the centerpieces of a multi-prong strategy to make the country safer.", "My administration started what's called the Proliferation Security Initiative.", "Over 60 nations involved with disrupting the trans-shipment of information and/or weapons of mass destruction materials.", "And we've been effective.", "We busted the A.Q.", "Khan network.", "This was a proliferator out of Pakistan that was selling secrets to places like North Korea and Libya.", "We convinced Libya to disarm.", "It's a central part of dealing with weapons of mass destruction and proliferation.", "I'll tell you another way to help protect America in the long run is to continue with missile defenses.", "And we've got a robust research and development program that has been ongoing during my administration.", "We'll be implementing a missile-defense system relatively quickly.", "And that is another way to help deal with the threats that we face in the 21st century.", "My opponent opposed the missile defenses.", " In the hands of a terrorist enemy.", " Weapons of mass destruction, nuclear proliferation.", "But again, the test or the difference between us, the president has had four years to try to do something about it, and North Korea has got more weapons; Iran is moving towards weapons.", "And at his pace, it will take 13 years to secure those weapons in Russia.", "I'm going to do it in four years, and I'm going to immediately set out to have bilateral talks with North Korea.", " Again, I can't tell you how big a mistake I think that is, to have bilateral talks with North Korea.", "It's precisely what Kim Jong Il wants.", "It will cause the six-party talks to evaporate.", "It will mean that China no longer is involved in convincing, along with us, for Kim Jong Il to get rid of his weapons.", "It's a big mistake to do that.", "We must have China's leverage on Kim Jong Il, besides ourselves.", "And if you enter bilateral talks, they'll be happy to walk away from the table.", "I don't think that'll work.", " No, I don't think it's OK, and said so publicly.", "I think that there needs to be checks and balances in a democracy, and made that very clear that by consolidating power in the central government, he's sending a signal to the Western world and United States that perhaps he doesn't believe in checks and balances, and I told him that.", "I mean, he's also a strong ally in the war on terror.", "He is -- listen, they went through a horrible situation in Beslan, where these terrorists gunned down young school kids.", "That's the nature of the enemy, by the way.", "That's why we need to be firm and resolved in bringing them to justice.", "That's precisely what Vladimir Putin understands, as well.", "I've got a good relation with Vladimir.", "And it's important that we do have a good relation, because that enables me to better comment to him, and to better to discuss with him, some of the decisions he makes.", "I found that, in this world, that it's important to establish good personal relationships with people so that when you have disagreements, you're able to disagree in a way that is effective.", "And so I've told him my opinion.", "I look forward to discussing it more with him, as time goes on.", "Russia is a country in transition.", "Vladimir is going to have to make some hard choices.", "And I think it's very important for the American president, as well as other Western leaders, to remind him of the great benefits of democracy, that democracy will best help the people realize their hopes and aspirations and dreams.", "And I will continue working with him over the next four years.", " Well, let me just say quickly that I've had an extraordinary experience of watching up close and personal that transition in Russia, because I was there right after the transformation.", "And I was probably one of the first senators, along with Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, a former senator, to go down into the KGB underneath Treblinka Square and see reams of files with names in them.", "It sort of brought home the transition to democracy that Russia was trying to make.", "I regret what's happened in these past months.", "And I think it goes beyond just the response to terror.", "Mr. Putin now controls all the television stations.", "His political opposition is being put in jail.", "And I think it's very important to the United States, obviously, to have a working relationship that is good.", "This is a very important country to us.", "We want a partnership.", "But we always have to stand up for democracy.", "As George Will said the other day, \"Freedom on the march; not in Russia right now.\"", "Now, I'd like to come back for a quick moment, if I can, to that issue about China and the talks.", "Because that's one of the most critical issues here: North Korea.", "Just because the president says it can't be done, that you'd lose China, doesn't mean it can't be done.", "I mean, this is the president who said \"There were weapons of mass destruction,\" said \"Mission accomplished,\" said we could fight the war on the cheap -- none of which were true.", "We could have bilateral talks with Kim Jong Il.", "And we can get those weapons at the same time as we get China.", "Because China has an interest in the outcome, too.", " You know my opinion on North Korea.", "I can't say it any more plainly.", " Pardon me?", " Oh, I'm a pretty calm guy.", "I don't take it personally.", " You know, we looked at the same intelligence and came to the same conclusion: that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat.", "And I don't hold it against him that he said grave threat.", "I'm not going to go around the country saying he didn't tell the truth, when he looked at the same intelligence I did.", " It was a threat.", "That's not the issue.", "The issue is what you do about it.", "The president said he was going to build a true coalition, exhaust the remedies of the U.N. and go to war as a last resort.", "Those words really have to mean something.", "And, unfortunately, he didn't go to war as a last resort.", "Now we have this incredible mess in Iraq -- $200 billion.", "It's not what the American people thought they were getting when they voted.", " Thank you, Jim, very much.", "Thank you very much to the university, again.", "Thank you, Mr. President.", "My fellow Americans, as I've said at the very beginning of this debate, both President Bush and I love this country very much.", "There's no doubt, I think, about that.", "But we have a different set of convictions about how we make our country stronger here at home and respected again in the world.", "I know that for many of you sitting at home, parents of kids in Iraq, you want to know who's the person who could be a commander in chief who could get your kids home and get the job done and win the peace.", "And for all the rest of the parents in America who are wondering about their kids going to the school or anywhere else in the world, what kind of world they're going to grow up in, let me look you in the eye and say to you: I defended this country as a young man in war, and I will defend it as president of the United States.", "But I have a difference with this president.", "I believe when we're strongest when we reach out and lead the world and build strong alliances.", "I have a plan for Iraq.", "I believe we can be successful.", "I'm not talking about leaving.", "I'm talking about winning.", "And we need a fresh start, a new credibility, a president who can bring allies to our side.", "I also have a plan to win the war on terror, funding homeland security, strengthening our military, cutting our finances, reaching out to the world, again building strong alliances.", "I believe America's best days are ahead of us because I believe that the future belongs to freedom, not to fear.", "That's the country that I'm going to fight for.", "And I ask you to give me the opportunity to make you proud.", "I ask you to give me the opportunity to lead this great nation, so that we can be stronger here at home, respected again in the world, and have responsible leadership that we deserve.", "Thank you.", "And God bless America.", " Thank you very much tonight, Jim.", "Senator.", "If America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy.", "That's not going to happen, so long as I'm your president.", "The next four years we will continue to strengthen our homeland defenses.", "We will strengthen our intelligence-gathering services.", "We will reform our military.", "The military will be an all-volunteer army.", "We will continue to stay on the offense.", "We will fight the terrorists around the world so we do not have to face them here at home.", "We'll continue to build our alliances.", "I'll never turn over America's national security needs to leaders of other countries, as we continue to build those alliances.", "And we'll continue to spread freedom.", "I believe in the transformational power of liberty.", "I believe that the free Iraq is in this nation's interests.", "I believe a free Afghanistan is in this nation's interest.", "And I believe both a free Afghanistan and a free Iraq will serve as a powerful example for millions who plead in silence for liberty in the broader Middle East.", "We've done a lot of hard work together over the last three and a half years.", "We've been challenged, and we've risen to those challenges.", "We've climbed the mighty mountain.", "I see the valley below, and it's a valley of peace.", "By being steadfast and resolute and strong, by keeping our word, by supporting our troops, we can achieve the peace we all want.", "I appreciate your listening tonight.", "I ask for your vote.", "And may God continue to bless our great land.", " Thank you, Jim.", "And thank you to the people of Hartford, our hosts.", "I want to begin by saying again how much I respect Senator Dole and his record of public service and how hard I will try to make this campaign and this debate one of ideas, not insults.", "Four years ago I ran for president at a time of high unemployment and rising frustration.", "I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community where everybody has a role to play.", "I wanted a government that was smaller and less bureaucratic to help people make the most of their own lives.", "Four years ago you took me on faith.",

keep it going.", "We cut the deficit by 60 percent.", "Now, let's balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.", "We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans.", "Now let's pass the tax cuts for education and child rearing, help with medical emergencies, and buying a home.", "We passed family and medical leave.", "Now let's expand it so more people can succeed as parents and in the work force.", "We passed 100,000 police, the assault weapons ban, the Brady Bill.", "Now let's keep going by finishing the work of putting the police on the street and tackling juvenile gangs.", "We passed welfare reform.", "Now let's move a million people from welfare to work.", "And most important, let's make education our highest priority so that every eight-year-old will be able to read, every 12-year-old can log onto the Internet, every 18-year-old can go to college.", "We can build that bridge to the 21st Century.", "And I look forward to discussing exactly how we're going to do it.", " Thank you.", "Thank you, Mr. President, for those kind words.", "Thank the people of Hartford, the Commission, and all those out here who may be listening or watching.", "It's a great honor for me to be here standing here as the Republican nominee.", "I'm very proud to be the Republican nominee reaching out to Democrats and Independents.", "I have three very special people with me tonight: My wife, Elizabeth; my daughter, Robin, who has never let me down, and a fellow named Frank Carafa from New York, along with Ollie Manninen who helped me out in the mountains of Italy a few years back.", "I've learned from them that people do have tough times.", "And sometimes you can't go it alone.", "And that's what America is all about.", "I remember getting my future back from doctors and nurses and a doctor in Chicago named Dr. Kalikian .", "And ever since that time, I've tried to give something back to my country, to the people who are watching us tonight.",

about the quality and the safety of your children, and the quality of education.", "But even more importantly, you worry about the future and will they have the same opportunities that you and I have had.", "And Jack Kemp and I want to share with you some ideas tonight.", "Jack Kemp is my running mate, doing an outstanding job.", "Now, I'm a plain-speaking man and I learned long ago that your word was your bond.", "And I promise you tonight that I'll try to address your concerns and not try to exploit them.", "It's a tall order, but I've been running against the odds for a long time and, again, I'm honored to be here this evening.", " Well, Jim, I believe that the Federal government should give people the tools and try to establish the conditions in which they can make the most of their own lives.", "That, to me, is the key.", "And that leads me to some different conclusions from Senator Dole.", "For example, we have reduced the size of the Federal government to its smallest size in 30 years.", "We reduced more regulations, eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors.", "But I have worked hard for things like the Family and Medical Leave Law, the Brady Bill, the assault weapons ban, the program to put 100,000 police on the street.", "All of these are programs that Senator Dole opposed that I supported, because I felt they were a legitimate effort to help people make the most of their own lives.", "I've worked hard to help families impart values to their own children.", "I supported the V-chip so that parents would be able to control what their kids watch on television when they're young, along with the ratings systems for television and educational television.", "I supported strong action against the tobacco companies to stop the marketing, advertising, and sale of tobacco to young people.", "I supported a big increase in the safe and drug-free schools program.", "These were areas on which Senator Dole and I differed, but I believed they were the right areas for America to be acting together as one country to help individuals and families make the most of their own lives and raise their kids with good values and a good future.", " I think the basic difference is, and I have had some experience in this, I think the basic difference, I trust the people.", "The President trusts the government.", "We go back and look at the healthcare plan that he wanted to impose on the American people.", "One seventh the total economy, 17 new taxes, price controls, 35 to 50 new bureaucracies that cost $1.5 trillion.", "Don't forget that, that happened in 1993.", "A tax increase, a tax on everybody in America.", "Not just the rich.", "If you made 25,000 as the original proposal, you got your Social Security taxes increased.", "We had a BTU tax we turned into a $35 million gas tax, a $265 billion tax increase.", "I guess I rely more on the individual.", "I carry a little card in my pocket called the Tenth Amendment.", "Where possible, I want to give power back to the states and back to the people.", "That's my difference with the President.", "We'll have specific differences later.", "He noted a few, but there are others.", " I trust the people.", "We've done a lot to give the people more powers to make their own decisions over their own lives.", "But I do think we are right when we try to, for example, give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital, ending these drive-by deliveries.", "I think we were right to pass the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, which says you can't lose your health insurance just because you change jobs or because someone in your family's been sick.", "Our government is smaller and less bureaucratic and has given more authority to the states than its two predecessors under Republican presidents.", "But I do believe we have to help our people get ready to succeed in the 21st Century.", " Well, he's better off than he was four years ago.", " I agree with that.", "That's right.", " And I may be better off four years from now, but I don't know.", "I looked at the slowest growth in the century.", "He inherited a growth of 4.7 4.8 percent, now it's down to about 2.4 percent.", "We're going to pass a million bankruptcies this year for the first time in history.", "We've got stagnant wages.", "In fact, women's wages have dropped 2.2 percent.", "Men's wages haven't gone up, gone down.", "So we have stagnation.", "We have the highest foreign debt in history.", "And it seems to me that if you take a look, are you better off?", "Well, I guess some may be better off.", "Saddam Hussein is probably better off than he was four years ago.", "Renee Proval (ph) is probably better off than he was four years ago.", "But are the American people?", "They're working harder and higher and harder paying more taxes.", "For the first time in history, you pay about 40 percent of what you earn.", "More than you spend for food, clothing and shelter combined for taxes under this administration.", "So some may be better off.", "They talk about family income being up.", "That's not true in Connecticut, family income is down.", "And it's up in some cases because both parents are working.", "One works for the family, and one works to pay taxes for the government.", "We're going to give them tax cuts so they can spend more time with their children, maybe even take a vacation.", "That's what America is all about.", " Well, let me say, first of all, in February Senator Dole acknowledged that the American economy was in the best shape it's been in in 30 years.", "We have ten and a half million more jobs, a faster job growth rate than under any Republican administration since the 1920s.", "Wages are goings up for the first time in a decade.", "We have record numbers of new small businesses.", "We have the biggest drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 years.", "All groups of people are growing.", "We had the biggest drop in income inequality in 27 years in 1995.", "The average family's income has gone up over $1600 just since our economic plan passed.", "So I think it's clear that we're better off than we were four years ago.", "Now we need to focus on what do we need to do to be better off still.", "How can we help people as we are to get their retirements when they work for small businesses, to be able to afford health insurance, to be able to educate their children.", "That's what I want to focus on.", "But we are clearly better off than we were four years ago, as Senator Dole acknowledged this year.", " I doubt that I acknowledged that this year.", "But in any event, I think we just look at the facts.", "We ask the people that are viewing tonight, are you better off than you were four years ago.", "It's not whether we're better off, it's whether they're better off.", "Are you working harder to put food on the table, feed your children.", "Are your children getting a better education.", "Drug use has doubled the past 44 months all across America.", "Crime has gone down but it's because the mayors like Rudy Giuliani where one third of the drop happened in one city, New York City.", "So, yes, some may be better off.", "But of the people listening tonight, the working families who will benefit from economic packages, they'll be better off when Bob Dole is president and Jack Kemp is vice president.", " Absolutely not.", "Let's look at the position.", "First of all, remember that in this campaign season, since Senator Dole's been a candidate, he has bragged about the fact that he voted against Medicare in the beginning, in 1965, one of only 12 members.", "He said he did the right thing then, he knew it wouldn't work at the time.", "That's what he said.", "Then his budget that he passed along with Speaker Gingrich cut Medicare $270 billion, more than was necessary to repair the Medicare trust fund.", "It would have charged seniors more for out-of-pocket costs as well as more in premiums because doctors could have charged them more.", "The American Medical, Hospital Association, the Nurses Association, the Catholic Hospital Association all said hundreds of hospitals could close and people would be hurt badly under the Dole-Gingrich Medicare plan that I vetoed.", "And now with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Senator Dole's, even his own friends, his campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says that they can't possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well, according to him.", "Now, my balanced budget plan adds ten years to the life of the Medicare trust fund, ten years.", "And we'll have time to deal with the long-term problems of the baby boomers.", "But it was simply wrong to finance their last scheme to cut Medicare $270 billion to run the risk of it withering on the vine.", "We always had to reform it over the years, but we need somebody who believes it in to reform it.", " Well, I must say, I look back at the vote on Medicare in 1965, we had a program called Eldercare that also provided drugs and means tests to people who needed medical attention received it.", "I thought it was a good program.", "But I've supported Medicare ever since.", "In fact, I used to go home, my mother would tell me, Bob, all I've got is my Social Security and my Medicare, don't cut it.", "I wouldn't violate anything my mother said.", "In fact, we had a conversation about our mothers one day, a very poignant conversation in the White House.", "I'm concerned about healthcare.", "I've had the best healthcare from government hospitals, Army hospitals and I know its importance, but we've got to fix it.", "It's his trustees, the President's trustees, not mine, who says it's going to go broke.", "He doesn't fix it for ten years.", "We ought to appoint a commission, just as we did in Social Security in 1983, when we rescued Social Security, and I was proud to be on that commission, along with Claude Pepper, the champion of senior citizens from Florida.", "And we can do it again, if we take politics out of it.", "Stop scaring the seniors, Mr. President.", "You've already spent $45 million scaring seniors and tearing me apart.", "I think it's time to have a truce.", " Well, let me say, first of all, I'd be happy to have a commission deal with this and I appreciate what Senator Dole did on the '83 Social Security commission.", "But it won't be possible to do, if his tax scheme passes because even his own campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says he'll have to cut Medicare even more than was cut in the bill that I vetoed.", "I vetoed that bill because it cut more Medicare and and basically ran the risk of breaking up the system.", "My balanced budget plan puts ten years on the Medicare.", "We ought to do that, then we can have a commission.", "But Senator Dole's plans are not good for the country.", " Oh, yes.", "And you'll be eligible.", " Me too?", " And so will the former President, yes.", " I need it.", " Well, the people need it, that's the point.", "This is not a Wall Street tax cut.", "This is a family tax cut.", "This is a Main Street tax cut, 15 percent across -- let's take a family making $30,000 a year, that's $1261.", "Now, maybe to some in this Bushnell Memorial that it's not a lot of money, but people watching tonight with a couple of kids, a working family, that's four or five months of day care, maybe a personal computer; it's may be three or four months of mortgage payments.", "This economic package is about families but it's a six-point package.", "First of all, it's a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution which President Clinton defeated.", "He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote the other way, but we lost by one vote.", "It's balancing a budget by the year 2002.", "It's a tax cut, cutting capital gains 50 percent.", "So you can go out and create more jobs and more opportunities.", "It's a state tax relief.", "It's a $500 per child tax credit.", "It's about litigation reforms.", "Now that the President gets millions of dollars from the trial lawyers, he probably doesn't like this provision.", "In fact, when I fell off the podium in Chico, before I lit the ground, hit the ground I had call on my cell phone from a trial lawyer saying I think we've got a case here.", "And it's also regulatory reform.", "It's a good package, Mr. President.", "We'd like to have your support.", " Well, here's the problem with it: It sounds very good, but there's a reason that 500 economists, including seven Nobel prize winners and business periodicals like Business Week, and even Senator Dole's friends, Senator Warren Rudman, former Republican senator from New Hampshire, says it's not a practical program.", "It's a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans, and small business loans.", "It's not good to raise the deficit.", "We worked too hard to lower it.", "It will actually raise taxes on nine million people and, in addition to that, it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year.", "So it sounds great, but our targeted tax cut for education, child rearing, healthcare and home buying, which is paid for in my balanced budget plan, something that he has not done, certified by the Congressional budget office, that's the right way to go.", " The President wants to increase spending 20 percent over the next six years.", "I want to increase spending 14 percent, that's how simple it is.", "I want the government to pinch pennies for a change instead of the American families.", "We're talking about six percentage points over six years, and with that money you give it back to the working people.", "You also provide opportunity scholarships so low income parents will have the same choice that others have in sending their children to better schools.", "It will work, and when it does work, Mr. President, I know you'll congratulate me.", " Well, I try to articulate my positions as clearly as possible, tell people what I stand for and let them decide whether they're going to support me or not.", "The Senator mentioned the trial lawyers.", "In the case of the product liability bill, which they passed and I vetoed, I think that's what he's talking about, I actually wanted to sign that bill.", "And I told the people exactly what the Congress exactly what kind of bill I would sign.", "Now, a lot of the trial lawyers didn't want me to sign any bill at all, but I had thought we ought to do what we could to cut frivolous lawsuits, but they wouldn't make some of the changes that I thought should be made.", "Now, let me just give you an example.", "I had a person in the Oval Office who lost a child in a school bus accident where a drunk driver caused the accident directly, but there were problems with the school bus.", "The drunk driver had no money.", "Under the new bill, if I had signed it, a person like that could never have had any recovery.", "I thought that was wrong.", "So I gave four or five specific examples to the Congress and said, prove to me that these people could recover but we're going to eliminate frivolous lawsuits, I'll sign the bill.", "But generally I believe that a president has to be willing to do what he thinks is right.", "I've done a lot of things that were controversial.", "My economic plan, my trade position, Bosnia, Haiti, taking on the NRA for the first time, taking on the tobacco companies for the first time.", "Sometimes you just have to do that because you know it's right for the country over the long run.", "That's what I've tried to do and that's what I will continue to do as president.", " How does he avoid conflict?", "Well, I don't know in the case of the trial lawyers.", "I look at the trial lawyers, and when you're a few million short, you run out to Hollywood and pick up two to four million and organized labor comes to Washington, D.C. and puts 35 million into the pot.", "Now, if these aren't special interests, I've got a lot to learn.", "I was there for a while before I left on June the 11th.", "The trial lawyers and I don't -- you know, my wife's a lawyer.", "We're the only two lawyers in Washington that trust each other.", "But we're lawyers, I like lawyers.", "I don't dislike trial lawyers.", "But it seemed to me there's got to be some end to the frivolous lawsuits and there's got to be some cap on punitive damage.", "You're putting a lot of business people out of business.", "Small businessmen and businesswomen who paid 70 percent of your ninteen , your$265 billion tax increase, the largest tax increase in the history of America.", "I said that one day and Pat Moynihan, a Democrat, say, no, he said, in the history of the world.", "So I modified it, the largest tax increase in the history of the world.", "And it seems to me that there is a problem there, Mr. President.", "And I will address you as Mr. President.", "You didn't do that with Mr. with President Bush in 1992.", " Let me say, first of all, I signed a tort reform bill that dealt with civilian aviation a couple of years ago.", "I proved that I will sign reasonable tort reform.", "Secondly, Senator Dole had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money, but it wasn't me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who were subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up for the Federal government when we tried to stop the advertising, marketing, and sales of tobacco to children.", "And it wasn't me that let the polluters actually come into the halls of Congress, into the rooms, and rewrite the environmental laws.", "That's what Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole did, not me.", " That's not true.", " So I believe that we should take a different approach to this and talk about how we stand on the issues instead of trying to characterize each other's motivations.", "I think Senator Dole and I just honestly disagree.", " I think it's very difficult.", "Let's be honest about it.", "That's why we need campaign finance reform.", "That's why I reach out to the Perot voters.", "We've done about all, we are the reform party, the Republican Party.", "And the Perot voters that are looking for a home ought to take a look at the Republican record.", "Whatever it is, whatever the checklist was in '92, it's all done with campaign finance reform.", "I worked with Senator Mitchell, who played me, I guess, in the debate warmup.", "We tried six or eight years ago.", "He appointed three people, I appointed three people to get campaign finance reform.", "We couldn't get it done, because I wasn't enforceable.", "You've suggested a commission, Newt Gingrich did, I suggested that at least four or five years ago.", "We have a commission on campaign finance reform.", "They send it to Congress, and we have to vote it up or down.", "That's how it works.", "We are never going to fix it by the parties, because Democrats want a better advantage for themselves, we want a better advantage as Republicans, and that's not how it's going to work.", "But I want to touch on this is tobacco thing.", "I know the President's been puffing a lot on that.", "But I want to go back to 1965.", "That was my first vote against tobacco companies when I said we ought to label cigarettes.", "And I've had a consistent record ever since 1965.", "We passed a bill in 1992 that encouraged the states to adopt programs to stop kids from smoking.", "All 50 states did it.", "It took three and a half years.", "It wasn't until election year, Mr. President, that you ever thought about stopping smoking.", "What about drugs that have increased, doubled in the last 44 months?", "Cocaine is up 141 percent -- marijuana, cocaine up 166 percent.", "It seems to me that you have a selective memory.", "You know, mine doesn't work that way.", "So I just want to try to correct it as we go along.", " Mr. Lehrer, I hope we'll have a chance to discuss drugs later in the program.", "But let me respond to what you said.", "I agree that too many incumbent politicians in Washington in both parties have consistently opposed campaign finance reform.", "That was certainly the case from the minute I got there.", "So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested -- a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission.", "And I shook hands with him on it and I appointed my members, and the commission never met.", "And then Senator Dole's ardent supporters, Senator McCain, who's out there today, along with Senator Feingold, supported, sponsored a campaign finance reform proposal.", "I strongly supported it.", "And members of Senator Dole's own party in the Senate killed it.", "And he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill.", "So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have.", "And I hope we can finally get it in the next session of Congress, because we need it badly.", " Well, on campaign reform itself, we're going to get it when we have a bipartisan commission, take it out of politics.", "Get people who don't have any interest in politics but understand the issue and let them make the recommendation to Congress.", "Now, we're now kidding anybody, Mr. President.", "These are sophisticated people watching tonight.", "Millions and millions of Americans.", "They know the Republican Party hasn't done it.", "They know the Democratic party won't do it.", "We ought to agree that somebody else should do it.", "And we have to vote it up or down, Mr. President.", " Well, Jim, I think every American in any position of responsibility should be concerned about what's happened.", "I am.", "But let's look at the overall record.", "Overall in America cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years, casual drug use down 13 percent.", "The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it.", "Let me tell you what I tried to do about it.", "I appointed a four-star general who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country as our nation's drug czar.", "The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired.", "We submitted the biggest drug budget ever.", "We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border.", "We supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including, including the death penalty for drug kingpins.", "And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug-free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all those things were very important.", "Do I think that I bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still don't understand drugs are wrong, drugs can kill you.", "Even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them.", "I think we all do.", "And I hope we can do better.", "I don't think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I don't think Senator Dole supports using using drugs.", "I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn't dangerous and won't kill them and won't destroy their lives, get the message and change.", " Again, well it's, you are very selective, Mr. President.", "You don't want to politicize drugs, but it's already politicized Medicare, go out and scare senior citizens and other vulnerable groups, veterans and people who get Pell Grants and things like this.", "I mean, you say we've done all these bad things, which isn't the case.", "But it seems to me the record is clear.", "The record is pretty clear in Arkansas, when you were governor.", "Drug use doubled.", "You resisted the appointment of a drug czar there because you thought it might interfere with treatment.", "But here you cut the drug czar's office 83 percent.", "You cut interdiction substantially.", "I mean that's what, I want to stop it from coming across the border.", "And in my administration, we're going to train the National Guard to stop it from coming across the border.", "This is a invasion of drugs from all over the world.", "And we have a responsibility.", "You had a surgeon -- or before General McCaffrey (ph) you had a lady who said we ought to consider legalizing drugs.", "Is that the kind of leadership we need?", "And I won't comment on other things that happened in your administration or your past about drugs.", "But it seems to me the kids ought to -- if they've started, they ought to stop and just don't do it.", " Let me say again, we did have a drug czar in Arkansas, but he answered to the governor, just like this one answers to the President.", "That's what I thought we ought to do.", "Secondly, Senator Dole, you voted against the crime bill that had the death penalty for drug kingpins in it.", "And you voted to cut services to 23 million school children under the safe and drug-free schools act.", "I don't think that means you're soft on drugs.", "We just have a different approach.", "But let me remind you, my family has suffered from drug abuse.", "I know what it's like to see somebody you love nearly lose their lives, and I hate drugs, Senator.", "We need to do this together and we can.", " Not if I didn't have a better idea.", "But I've got a better idea.", "It's something I've worked on for 15 years.", "It's called the automated check or the instant check.", "It's being used in 17 states right now.", "States like Florida, Colorado, Virginia, and other states.", "You don't buy any gun.", "You don't get any gun.", "We've got 20 million names on a computer in Washington, D.C. of people who should not have guns.", "We ought to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.", "And, there are eight other categories that should not have guns.", "I've been working on this for a long, long time.", "You walk in, you put your little card in there.", "If it says tilt, you don't get any gun.", "You don't get a hand gun, you don't get a rifle, you don't get a shot gun, you get zippo.", "If we're going to protect American children and American families and people who live as prisoners in their own home, we've got to stop guns from being dumped on the street.", "The administration says they support the instant check.", "They've appropriated about $200 million, but only spent about $3 million to get it underway.", "In our administration, in my administration, we will expedite.", "This keeps up with technology.", "It keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have guns.", "That is the bottom line.", "And I believe it's a good idea, has strong bipartisan support.", "And perhaps that's another thing we can depoliticize.", "You talk about the Brady Bill.", "There has only been one prosecution under the Brady -- only one under the assault weapon ban and only seven under the Brady Bill that you talk about all the time.", "And on the assault weapon ban, out of 17 weapons that were banned, only six banned now because eleven have been modified and are back on the street.", "Let's get together on this instant check because that will really make a difference.", " Let me say, first of all, Senator Dole has gone back and forth about whether he'd be for repealing the Brady Bill or repealing the assault weapons ban.", "And I think his present position is he would not do so, and if that's true I'm grateful for it.", "But let's look at the facts here.", "The Brady Bill has kept at least 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers from getting hand guns.", "Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill.", "He tried to keep it from coming to my desk.", "He didn't succeed and I signed it and I'm glad I did.", "Then when we had the assault weapons ban in the Senate, Senator Dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the National Rifle Association didn't want the assault weapons ban, just like they didn't want the Brady Bill.", "But two years later nobody's lost their handguns.", "I mean, their rifles.", "We've expanded the Brady Bill to cover people who beat up their spouses and their kids.", "And this is a safer country.", "So I'm glad I took on that fight and I believe, with all respect, I was right and he was wrong.", " Well, the President doesn't have it quite right.", "I mean, it seemed to me at the time the assault weapon ban was not effective.", "But that's history.", "I told the NRA that's history.", "You're not going to worry about it anymore.", "I'm not going to worry about it anymore.", "Let's do something better.", "Let's stop, you know, playing the political game, Mr. President.", "Talking about this and this.", "You add all the states that've used the instant check and how many weapons they keep, kept out of the hands of criminals.", "It would far surpass the numbers you mentioned.", "So in my view, if you want to be protected, you ought to vote for Bob Dole and we'll get the instant check passed and we'll keep guns out of the hands of criminals.", " If he, that's what he said, he's not right about that.", "Look at where we are today.", "The United States is still the indispensable nation in the aftermath of the Cold War and on the brink of the 21st Century.", "I have worked to support our country as the world's strongest force for peace and freedom, prosperity and security.", "We have done the following things: Number one, we've managed the aftermath of the Cold War, supporting a big drop in nuclear weapons in Russia.", "The removal of Russian troops from the Baltics.", "The integration of Central and Eastern European democracies into a new partnership with NATO.", "And, I might add, with the democratic Russia.", "There are no nuclear missiles pointed at the children of the United States tonight and have not been in our administration for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age.", "We have worked hard for peace and freedom.", "When I took office, Haiti was governed by a dictator that had defied the United States.", "When I took office, the worst war in Europe was waging in Bosnia.", "Now there is a the democratically elected president in Haiti.", "Peace in Bosnia.", "We just had the election there.", "We've made progress in Northern Ireland, in the Middle East.", "We've also stood up to the new threats of terrorism.", "The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, and we have worked hard to expand America's economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade with the largest new number of trade agreements in history And that's one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again.", " Well, I have a different view.", "Again, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve supported the President on Bosnia, and I think we were told the troops would be out in a year.", "Now I understand it's been extended 'til some time next year.", "But, let's start with Somalia, where they dragged Americans through the streets, and where 18 Americans were killed one day, because they didn't have, they were pinned down for eight hours, the rangers.", "They didn't have the weapons, they didn't have the tanks.", "They asked for the tanks.", "They didn't get the tanks from this administration because we were nation building.", "It's called mission creep.", "We turn it over to the United Nations.", "The President didn't have much to do about it.", "You look at Haiti, where we spend about three billion dollars and we got an alarm call there about two weeks ago.", "You got to send down some more people, because the president's found out there are death squads on his on his, in his own property.", "So we need more protection from America.", "Bosnia, Northern Ireland.", "There's no ceasefire in Bosnia.", "I think there are still lot of problems in Bosnia.", "We agreed to train and arm the Muslims so they could defend themselves, the policy you had when you ran in 1992.", "We haven't done that.", "We're way behind, which means Americans can't come home.", "Americans shouldn't have gone there in the first place, had we let them defend themselves, as they have a right to do under Article 57 of the United Nations charter.", " First of all, I take full responsibility for what happened in Somalia, but the American people must remember that those soldiers were under an American commander when that happened.", "I believe they did the best they could under the circumstances, and let's not forget that hundreds of thousands of lives were saved there.", "Secondly, in Haiti, political violence is much, much smaller than it was.", "Thirdly, in Bosnia it's a virtual miracle that there has been no return to war and at least there has now been an election.", "And institutions are beginning to function.", "In Northern Ireland, in the Middle East we are better off than we were four years ago.", "There will always be problems in this whole world.", "But if we're moving in the right direction and America is leading, we're better off.", " Well it, after World War I, we had, you know, a policy of disengagement.", "Then from World War I to World War II we had sort of a compulsory engagement policy.", "Now I think we have a selective engagement policy.", "We have to determine when our interests are involved, not the United Nations' interests.", "And many of the things the President talked about, he turned over to the United Nations.", "They decided.", "He's deployed more troops than any president in history around the world.", "It's cost us billions and billions of dollars for peace-keeping operations.", "Look these are facts.", "And it seems to me that when you make a decision, the decision is made by the President of the United States, by the Commander-in-Chief.", "He makes that decision when he commits young men or young women who are going to go round and defend our liberty and our freedom.", "That would be my position.", "Then I'm going to have a top down review at the Pentagon, not a bottom up review.", "We all fight over how much money is there.", "I want a top down review to determine what our priorities are and what we should do in defense, and then follow that policy instead of this bottom up review with all the services fighting for the money.", "You know, the President said he was going to cut defense $60 billion, he cut defense $112 billion.", "Devastated states like California and others.", "And I think now we've got a problem.", "We've got to go back and look.", "It's just like you said in Texas one day, you know raised taxes too much, and you did, and you cut defense too much, Mr. President, and you did.", "You may have said that, too.", "But the bottom line is, we are the strongest nation in the world.", "We provide the leadership and we're going to have to continue to provide the leadership, but let's do it on our terms when our interests are involved and not when somebody blows the whistle at the United Nations.", " Our military is the strongest military in the world.", "It is the strongest, best prepared, best equipped it has ever been.", "There is very little difference in the budget that I proposed and the Republican budget over the next six-year period.", "We are spending a lot of money to modernize our weapons system.", "I have proposed a lot of new investments to improve the quality of life for our soldiers, for our men and women in uniform, for their families, for their training.", "That is my solemn obligation.", "You ask when do you decide to deploy them.", "The interests of the American people must be at stake.", "Our values must be at stake.", "We have to be able to make a difference.", "And frankly we have to consider what the risks are to our young men and women in uniform.", "But I believe the evidence is that our deployments have been successful, in Haiti, in Bosnia, when we moved to Kuwait to repel Saddam Hussein's threatened invasion of Kuwait.", "When I have sent the fleet into the Taiwan straits.", "When we've worked hard to end the Northern Korean nuclear threat.", "I believe the United States is at peace tonight in part because of the disciplined, careful, effective deployment of our military resources.", " Well I failed to mention North Korea and Cuba, a while ago.", "You look at North Korea where they have enough plutonium to build six nuclear bombs.", "We've sort of distanced ourselves from our ally, South Korea.", "They lost about a million people in the war, the Korean War, the forgotten war.", "We lost 53,000 Americans.", "We shouldn't be doing any favors for North Korea.", "It's a closed society.", "We don't have any inspection.", "We don't know whether it's going to work or not, but we keep giving the incentives.", "Someone called them something else.", "Incentives.", "We don't know what's going to happen.", "Here we have Cuba 90 miles from our shores, and what have we done, we passed the law that gave people a right to sue and the President postponed it for six months.", "And it seemed to me if you want to send a signal, you've got to send a signal, Mr. President.", "The sooner the better off we'll be, if you put tougher sanctions on Castro, not try to make it easier for him.", " Well, first of all, for the last four years we have worked had to put more and more pressure on the Castro government to bring about more openness and move toward democracy.", "In 1992, before I became President, the Congress passed the Cuba Democracy Act and I enforced it vigorously.", "We made the embargo tougher but we increased contacts people to people with the Cubans, including direct telephone service, which was largely supported by the Cuban-American community.", "Then Cuba shot down two of our planes and murdered four people in international air space.", "They were completely beyond the pale of the law, and I signed the Helms-Burton legislation.", "Senator Dole is correct.", "I did give about six months before the effective date of the act before lawsuits can actually be filed, even though they're effective now, and can be legally binding, because I want to change Cuba.", "And the United States needs help from other countries.", "Nobody in the world agrees with our policy on Cuba now.", "But this law can be used as leverage to get other countries to help us to move Cuba to democracy.", "Every single country in Latin America, Central America and the Caribbean is a democracy tonight but Cuba.", "And if we stay firm and strong, we will be able to bring Cuba around as well.", " That's the point I made.", "We have to be firm and strong.", "And I hope that will happen.", "It will happen starting next January and maybe it can happen the balance of this year.", "We have not been firm and strong.", "You look at the poor people who still live in Cuba.", "It's a haven for drug smugglers and we don't have a firm policy when it comes to Fidel Castro.", "In my view, the policy has failed.", "So Congress passes the law, the President signs it, like he does a lot of things.", "But he, like welfare reform, I'm going to sign it but I'm going to try to change it next year.", "A lot of these election-year conversions, the President talks about the drug money, and all the other things, all this antismoking campaign all happened in 1996.", "And I think the people viewing out there ought to go back and take a look at the record when he fought a balanced budget amendment.", "When he gave you that biggest tax increase in history; when he tried to take over your healthcare system.", "When he fought regulatory reform that cost the average family 6 to $7,000 a year.", "This is a serious business.", "It's about your family; it's about your business, and in this case it's about a firmer policy with Cuba.", " There were several off-the-subject quaffers in that litany.", "Let me just mention, Senator Dole voted for $900 billion in tax increases.", "His running mate Jack Kemp once said that Bob Dole never met a tax he didn't hike.", "And everybody knows, including the Wall Street Journal, hardly a friend of the Democratic party of this administration, that the '82 tax increase he sponsored in inflation-adjusted dollars was the biggest tax increase in American history.", "So we ought to at least get the facts out here on the table so we can know where to go from here.", " Let me first answer that question about the 1982 tax cut.", "We were closing loopholes, we were going after big corporations.", "I know you probably would oppose it, Mr. President, but I think we should have a fairer system and a flatter system, and we'll have a fairer and flatter system and we're going to make the economic package work.", "Healthcare.", "Well, we finally passed the Kassebaum bill.", "The President was opposed to it in 1993.", "He wanted to give us this big system, that took over about one-seventh of the economy, that put on price controls, created all these state alliances, and would cost $1.5 trillion and force people into managed care, whether they wanted it or not.", "Most people want to see their own doctor.", "They're going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president.", "We won't threaten anybody.", "So we passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy, the Kennedy Kassebaum bill that will cover about 20 to 25 million people.", "We've been for that for four, five, six years.", "The President held it up.", "And even when it finally got near passage, Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days, because he wasn't satisfied with one provision.", "But it will cover preexisting conditions.", "If you change your job, you're going to be covered.", "So there are a lot of good things in this bill we should have done instead of trying this massive, massive takeover by the Federal government.", "But then of course we had a Democratic Congress and they didn't want to do that.", "Until we got a Republican Congress, we finally got action, I'm proud of my colleagues in the Republican Party for getting that done.", "It means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight.", " Well, that sounds very good, but it's very wrong.", "Senator Dole remembers well that we actually offered not to even put in a healthcare bill in 1994, uh '93, but instead to work with the Senate Republicans and write a joint bill.", "And they said no because they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big government and make sure nothing was done to aid healthcare before the '94 elections so they could make that claim.", "Well, maybe we bit off more than we could chew, but we're pursuing a step-by-step reform now.", "The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that I signed will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change jobs or when somebody in their family's been sick.", "I signed a bill to stop these drive-by deliveries when insurance companies can force people out of the hospital after 24 hours and I vetoed Senator Dole's Medicare plan that would have forced a lot of seniors into managed care and taken a lot more money out of their pockets and led to Medicare withering on the vine.", " Well, many of the provisions in the Kassebaum bill were provisions that -- my provisions, like deductions for long-term care, making certain that self-employed people that are watching tonight can deduct not 30 percent but 80 percent of you pay for premiums.", "You can also deduct long-term care now, so it's a good it's a good start.", "I think there's enough -- we're even looking at our tax cut proposal, our economic package.", "There may be a way of reaching out to the uninsured, because there are a lot of uninsured people in the country, particularly children, that should be covered.", "Another way you can do is to expand Medicaid.", "In America no one will go without healthcare, no one will go without food.", " All right.", "Food.", " Well, the president's own CIA director says Saddam is stronger now than he was.", "I don't understand extending the no-fly zone in the south when the trouble was in the north.", "And what we've done during the Bush administration, the Kurds were at the State Department, negotiating, trying to work their differences out.",

was.", "We shot, what, 44 cruise missiles, worth about a million-two a piece, and hit some radar, that repaired in a couple, three days.", "Did we inflict any damage?", "No.", "Did we have any allies

didn't even understand that.", "We had to get their permission.", "The bottom line is, we went in there alone.", "We are supposed to be operating under a U.N. resolution.", "We did it without any of our allies that helped in the Gulf.", " Senator Dole has two or three times before tonight criticized me for working with the U.N.

have a veto on our foreign policy.", "I could not send soldiers into the north of Iraq, that would have been wrong.", "It could reduce Saddam Hussein's abilities to threaten Kuwait and his other

with us.", "The Mideast is very difficult.", "But it seemed to me just as an observer that you know before you'd call somebody to America, you'd have some notion what the end result might be.", "Now maybe it's better just to get together and sit down and talk.", "Maybe that was the purpose.", "And I know talks have started again today.", "But again it's almost like an ad hoc foreign policy.",

America.", "I think we have lost credibility, and I say this very honestly without any partisanship.", "We've lost credibility around the world.", "Our allies know, -- they're not certain what we're going to do, what our reaction, what our response is going to be.", "Nobody suggested sending troops to Iraq, if that was the hint there from the President.", "But I do think that Saddam Hussein is

about it.", "It shouldn't be politicized in any way by the President or by his opponent.", "And I don't intend to politicize it.", "I hope they talked and I hope they've reached some result and that

that.", "He's troubled, as I am, by some of the things that go on today.", "But I believe America is the greatest country in human history because we have maintained freedom and increasing prosperity by relentlessly pushing the barriers of knowledge, the barriers of the present, always moving into the future.", "That's why when I became President I was determined to kind of move beyond this whole stale debate that had gone on in Washington for too long to get this country moving again.", "And that's why we've got a country with ten and a half million more jobs, and record numbers of new businesses, and rising incomes, and falling crime rates, and welfare roll rates.", "That's why we're moving in the right direction.", "And I'm trying to emphasize that what I want to do is to continue

rule, we divided by six.", "Maybe in your case maybe just two.", "But 11 million new jobs and everything, I mean the President can't take credit for everything that governors are doing, whether that's happening in New York City when it comes to the murder rate and then not be responsible for the bad things that happen, whether it's drug use or something else in America.", "So it seems to me that we can talk about what we call Kenny, the great exaggerator.", "He just liked to make it sound exager, a little better, made him feel better.", "When it comes to bridges, I want a bridge to the future.",

for that.", "I also personally took responsibility tonight when Senator Dole asked me about the drug problem.", "But, you know, I think my ideas are better for the future.", "Senator Dole voted against student loans, against Headstart, against creating the Department of Education.", "If he gets elected president, we'll start the new century without anyone in the cabinet of the President

was in, started.", "I voted against it.", "It was a tribute after President Carter's election to the National Education Association who send a lot of delegates to the Democratic convention, who gives 99.5 percent of their money, Democrat Democrats, and the President, and a lot of the teachers send their kids to private schools or better public schools.", "So what we want to do is called

things that I think might be helpful to people.", "So it seems to me that we ought to take that money we can save from the Department of Education, put it into opportunity scholarships and tell little Landale Shakespeare out in Cleveland, Ohio, and tell your mother and father, you're going to get to go to school because we're going to match what the state puts up, and you're going to go to the school of your choice.", "I don't fault the President or the vice president for sending their children to private schools or better schools.", "I applaud them for it, I don't criticize them.", "But why shouldn't everybody have that choice.", "Why shouldn't low income Americans and low middle income Americans.", "I'm excited about it.", "It's going to be a big, big opportunity for a lot of people.", " Let me say first of all, I'm all for students having more choices.", "We've worked hard to expand public school choice in my balanced budget bill.", "There's funds for 3,000 new schools

children.", "The ones that are out there are doing well.", "What I'm against is Senator Dole's plan to take money away from all the children we now help with limited Federal funds and help far fewer.", "If we're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be done at the local level or the state level.", "But Senator Dole has consistently opposed Federal help to education.", "He voted against student loans; he voted against my improved student loan plan; he voted against the National Service bill, against the HeadStart bill; he voted against our efforts in safe and drug-free schools.", "He voted against these programs, he does not believe it.", "That's the issue.", "90 percent of our kids are out there in those public schools and we need to lift their standards and move them forward with the programs like those I've outlined in this campaign.", " I'd better correct the President.", "I don't know what time it is, but it's probably getting late.", "I want to correct, the all these things I voted against, they were probably part of some big package that had a lot of pork in it or a lot of things that we shouldn't have had and we probably voted no.", "I've supported all the education programs.", "I've supported Headstart, I think we ought to look at it.", "So I don't want anybody out there to think we've just been voting no, no, no.", "Let's give low income parents the same right that people of power and prestige have in America and let them go to better schools.", "Let's not, let's help, let's turn the schools back to the teachers and back to the parents and take it away from the National Education Association.", " I support school choice.", "I support school choice.", "I have advocated expansions of public school choice alternatives and I said the creation of 3,000 new schools that we are going to help the states to finance.", "But if you're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be determined by states in localities where they're raising and spending most of the money.", "I simply think it's wrong to take money away from programs that are helping build basic skills for kids, 90 percent of them are in the public schools; to take money away from programs that are helping fund the school lunch program, that are helping to fund the other programs, that are helping our schools to improve their standards.", "Our schools are getting better, and our schools can be made to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level.", "I have been a strong force for reform.", "And, Senator, I remind you that a few years ago when I supported teacher testing while in my home state I was pretty well lambasted by the teachers association.", "I just don't believe we ought to be out there running down teachers and attacking them the way you did at the Republican convention.", "I think we ought to be lifting them up and moving our children forward.", "And let me just say that budget that you passed that I vetoed would have cut 50,000 kids out of Headstart.", "It would have eliminated the AmeriCorps plan and it would have cut back on student loans and scholarships.", "Now, it would have.", "That's a fact.", "That's one of the big reasons I vetoed it.", "We need to be doing more in education, not less.", " Well, the AmeriCorps program, I must say, if that's one of your successes, I wouldn't speak about it too loudly.", "It costs about $27,000 to pay people to volunteer.", "We've got four million young people volunteering every year, the number hasn't gone down.", "And you pick out 20,000, whether they need the money or not, and they get paid for volunteering.", "I like young people.", "I like teachers.", "I'm a product of a public school.", "You attended a private school for some time in your life.", "I like teachers.", "You're not for school choice, you can't be for school choice, because this is that special interest money again.", "When you get 99.5 percent of the money, we don't know what happened to the other .5 percent, we're looking for it, somebody got it, but it all went to Democrats.", "And this is part of that liberal establishment, one of those liberal things that you just can't do.", "You're for school uniforms and curfews and you're opposed to truancy.", "Now that's not reform, Mr. President.", "Why can't Landale Shakespeare in Cleveland or Pilar Gonzales in Milwaukee give their children an opportunity to go to a better school.", "Some schools aren't safe.", "Some schools aren't even safe.", "Your choice is nothing.", "Let's give them a real choice, the kind of choice you had, and the kind of choice a lot of people have in America.", "If we want to stop crime and teenage pregnancy, let's start with education.", " First of all, Senator Dole, let's set the record straight.", "I was able for two years when I was in, a very young boy to go to a Catholic school, but I basically went to public schools all my life.", "And I've worked hard for a long time to make them better, 90 percent of our kids are there.", "You, it's amazing to me, you are all for having more responsibility at the local level for everything except schools.", "Where we don't have very much money at the Federal level to spend on education, we ought to spend it helping the 90 percent of the kids that we can help.", "If a local school district in Cleveland or anyplace else wants to have a private choice plan like Milwaukee did, let them have at it.", "I might say the results are highly ambiguous.", "But I want to get out there and give a better education opportunity to all of our children and that's why I vetoed the budget you passed with $30 billion in education cuts.", "It was wrong, and my plan for the future is better.", " I had precisely in mind a lot of the people that were in the White House and other agencies who've never been had any experience, who came to Washington without any experience, they all were very liberal, of course, or they wouldn't be in the administration.", "And their idea was that they knew what was best for the American people.", "Now, I feel very strongly about a lot of things.", "I feel strongly about education.", "I want to help young people have an education, just as I had an education after World War II with the GI bill of Rights.", "We've had millions of young men and women in subsequent subsequent wars change the face of the nation because the government helped with their education.", "Now the reason they don't have, The reason the President can't support this is pretty obvious.", "It's not taking anything away from schools, it's new money.", "It's not being taken away from anybody else, except we'll downsize the Department of Education.", "But this is a very liberal administration.", "This is an administration that gave you the big tax cut.", "This administration tried to take over healthcare and impose a governmental system.", "This is the administration that fought regulatory reform that is putting a lot of small businessmen and small businesswomen out of business.", "This is the administration that fought the balanced budget amendment and vetoed a balanced budget and vetoed welfare reform twice, and the list goes on and on and on, that's what I had in mind.", "I want people in my administration and will have people in my administration who understand America.", "There won't be 10 millionaires and 14 lawyers in the cabinet.", "There will be people with experience and people who understand America and people who've made it and know the hard knocks in life.", " When Senator Dole made that remark about all the elitists, all the young elitists in the administration, one of the young men who works for me who grew up in a house trailer looked at me and said, Mr. President, I know how you grew up, who is he talking about.", "And you know this liberal charge, that's what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race.", "It's sort of their golden oldie, you know.", "It's a record they think they can play that everybody loves to hear.", "And I just don't think that dog will hunt this time.", "The American people should make up their own mind.", "Here's the record: We cut deficit four years in a row for the first time before the Civil War -- I mean, before World War II, and maybe before the Civil War, too.", "We've got ten and a half million new jobs; we've got record numbers of those new small businesses.", "We've made every one of them eligible for a tax cut.", "We've got declining crime rates, two million fewer people on welfare rolls before welfare reform passed, and a 50 percent increase in child support and a crime bill with 60 death penalties and 100,000 police and the assault weapons ban.", "The American people can make up their mind about whether that's a liberal record or a record that's good for America.", "Liberal, conservative, you put whatever label you want on it.", " Well, I think it's pretty liberal, I'll put that label on it.", "You take a look at all the programs you've advocated, Mr. President.", "Thank goodness we had a Republican Congress there.", "The first thing you did when you came into office was set up the stimulus package, said we've got a little pork we want to scatter around America, $16 billion.", "And even some in your own party couldn't buy that.", "I remember talking by the telephone.", "I'm not even certain you were too excited about that.", "I won't, I never repeat what I've talked to the President about.", "In any event, we saved the taxpayers $16 billion.", "And then came some other program, and then came healthcare, and then came the tax increase and a lot of these things stopped in 1994 because then the Congress changed, and I think we've done a good job.", " I believe that the purpose of politics is to give people the tools to make the most of their own lives; to reinforce the values of opportunity and responsibility, and to build a sense of community so we're all working together.", "I don't believe in discrimination.", "I believe you can protect the environment and grow the economy.", "I believe that we have to do these things with a government that's smaller and less bureaucratic, but that we have to do them nonetheless.", "It's inconvenient for Senator Dole, but the truth is I've reduced the size of government more than my Republican predecessors.", "And I did stop them, I admit that.", "I sure stopped their budget.", "Their budget cut enforcement for the Environmental Protection Agency by a third.", "It cut funds to clean up toxic waste dumps with 10 million of our kids still living within four miles of a toxic waste dump, by a third.", "It ended the principle that the polluters should pay for those toxic waste dumps unless it was very recent.", "Their budget weakened our support for education.", "$30 billion, even cut funds for scholarships and college loans.", "Their budget cut $270 billion in Medicare and, finally, their budget withdrew the national guarantee of healthcare to poor children, families with children with handicaps, the elderly in nursing homes, poor pregnant women.", "It was wrong for the country and calling it conservative won't make it right.", "It was a bad decision for America and would have been bad for our future if I hadn't stopped it.", " Well, the President can define himself in any way he wants, but I think we have to look at the record.", "Go back to the time he was, what, Texas director for George McGovern.", "George McGovern is a friend of mine, so I don't mean, but he was a liberal, proud liberal.", "I've just finished reading a book, I think it's called -- what is it called, what is it, The Demise of the Democratic Party by Ronald Cardash (ph) or something talking about all the liberal influences in the administration.", "Whether it's organized labor or whether it's the Hollywood elite or whether some of the media elite or whether it's the labor unions or whatever.", "And so I think you take a look at it.", "The bottom line is this: I think the American people, thought he'd recite all these bills and all these things, they want to know what's going to happen to them.", "They've all got a lot of anxieties out there.", "Did anybody complain when you raised taxes?", "Did anybody go out and ask the people, how are you going to pay the extra money?", "That's why we want an economic package.", "We want the government to pinch their pennies for a change instead of the people pinching their pennies.", "That's what our message is to the people watching.", "Not all this back and forth, you voted this way, you voted that way, we want a better America as we go into the next century.", " The way you get a better America is to balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment; to give a targeted tax cut -- and let me talk about the education tax cut -- to let people have a $10,000 deduction for the cost of college tuition in any year, any kind of college tuition; to give families a tax credit, a dollar for dollar reduction in their taxes for the cost of a typical community college so we can open that to everybody.", "And then to let people save in an IRA and withdraw from it without a tax penalty for education, home buying or medical expenses, that's the right way to go into the 21st Century, balance the budget and cut taxes, not balloon with this $550 billion tax scheme.", " Let me say first, on the President's promise for another tax cut.", "I mean, I've told people as I've traveled around, all of you that got the tax cut he promised last time, vote for him in '96 and not many hands go up.", "So the question is, would you buy a used election promise from my opponent.", "The people want economic reform.", "They're having a hard time making ends meet.", "You've got one parent working for the government, the other parent working for the family.", "This is important business.", "This is about getting the economy moving again.", "This is about American jobs and opportunities.", "It's about the government, as I said before, pinching its pennies for a change instead of the poor taxpayer.", "When they raise your taxes nobody runs around asking people where are you going to get the extra money.", "I think the government can do better.", "Are there personal differences?", " Well, my blood pressure is lower, my weight, my cholesterol, but I will not make health an issue in this campaign.", "So I think he's a bit taller than I am.", "But I think there are personal differences.", "I mean, I'm not I don't like to get into personal matters.", "As far as I'm concerned, this is a campaign about issues.", "It's about my vision for America and about his liberal vision for America.", "And not about personal things.", "You know, I think his liberal vision is a thing of the past.", "I know he wants to disown it.", "I wouldn't want to be a liberal either, Mr. President, but you're stuck with it because that's your record, that's your record in Arkansas: The biggest tax increase in history.", "The biggest crime increase in history, the biggest drug increase in history in Arkansas.", " Well, just for the record, when I was governor we had the lowest -- second lowest tax burden of any state in the country, the highest job growth rate of any state when I ran for president and were widely recognized for a lot of other advances.", "But the important thing is, what are we going to do now.", "I think a targeted tax cut is better for our future, targeted to education and child rearing, with the rest of the education plan, hooking up all of our classrooms to the Internet by the year 2000.", "Making sure we've got an army of reading volunteers, trained people to teach with parents and teachers so that our eight year olds can learn to read.", "Investing in our environment.", "Cleaning up two-thirds of the worst toxic waste dumps.", "Those plans are better than this $550 billion tax scheme.", "Now, remember, folks, even Senator Dole's campaign co-chair here, Senator D'Amato, says he's got to cut Medicare to pay for this.", "Everybody who's looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it's bad for the economy.", "It's going to blow a hole in the deficit It's going to raise taxes on nine million people and require bigger cuts than the one I vetoed.", "Our plan is better, it will take us into the future with a growing economy and healthier families.", " Well, I'm really encouraged to know of your renewed friendship with Al D'Amato, and I know he appreciates it.", "You didn't even have tax cuts in your budget, Mr. President, the first two years you were president.", "It wasn't until we had a Republican Congress you even thought about, you talked about tax cuts.", "Getting back to personal differences, I think, Jim, if you are a little more specific, but I think the President could clarify one thing tonight and that's the question of pardons.", "I know you talked about it on the Jim, with Jim Lehrer on the PBS show.", "And I've never discussed Whitewater, as I've told you personally.", "I'm not discussing Whitewater now.", "But I am discussing the power the President has to grant pardons.", "And hopefully in the next segment you could lay that to rest.", " Well, first of all, you know, he made that remark about Senator D'Amato.", "He's arranged for me to spend a lot more time with Senator D'Amato in the last couple years so I'm more familiar with his comments than I used to be.", "Let me say what I've said already about this pardon issue.", "This is an issue they've brought up.", "It's under, there's been no consideration of it, no discussion of it.", "I will tell you this: I will not give anyone special treatment and I will strictly adhere to the law.", "And that is what every president has done, as far as I know, in the past but what every other president's has done.", "This is something I take seriously and that's my position.", " But it seems to me the president shouldn't have any comment at all.", "Particularly where it's someone where you've had business dealings.", "I mean, you may be sending a signal.", "I don't know, I'm not questioning anybody.", "But as a President of the United States, when somebody asks you about pardons, you say no comment, period.", "And I think he made a mistake.", "And I think when you make a mistake, you say I made a mistake.", "But apparently his position hasn't changed.", "If there are other specific areas, but beyond that I haven't gotten into any of these things, as the President knows.", "We've had that discussion.", "And again I know Senator D'Amato I think may have had a hearing or two on Whitewater, I can't remember, but he's not my general chairman, he's a friend of mine.", "And so is Senator Kennedy a friend of yours.", " You bet.", " I remember one day on the floor I said now, gentlemen, let me tax your memories, and Kennedy jumped up and said, why haven't we thought of that before.", "You know, so one of your liberal friends.", " Thank you.", " No comment.", " What's the subject matter?", " See, if I say anything it's going to be misconstrued.", "I don't think there is even a race between the two, it's about our vision for America.", "I happen to like President Clinton personally.", "I'm addressing him all evening as Mr. President.", "I said in 1992 he didn't extend that courtesy to President Bush.", "But I respect the presidency.", "I've served under a number of presidents.", "They all have their strengths and they all have their weaknesses.", "So I'd rather talk about my strengths.", "And I think I have my strengths and I think the best thing going for Bob Dole is that Bob Dole keeps his word.", "It's a question between trust and fear, and I would say, I think, Mr. President, about all you've got going in this campaign is fear.", "You're spending millions and millions of dollars in negative ads frightening senior citizens.", "I know this to be a fact because I had one tell me last week, Senator don't cut my Medicare.", "I'm trying to save your Medicare, just as I rescued Social Security with a bipartisan commission.", "I have relatives on Medicare.", "I used to sign welfare checks for my grandparents.", "I know all about poverty and all about need and all about taking care of people, and that's been my career in the United States Senate.", "And I'll keep my word on the economic package.", "If I couldn't cut taxes and balance the budget the same time, I wouldn't look at you in the eye in your living room or wherever you might be and say that this is good for America.", "People will tell you who served with Bob Dole, agree or disagree, he kept his word.", "That's what this race is all about.", " I'd like the American people to know that I have worked very hard to be on their side.", "And to move this country forward and we're better off than we were four years ago.", "But the most important thing is my plan for the 21st Century is a better plan.", "A targeted tax cut, a real commitment to educational reform.", "A deep commitment to making welfare reform work with incentives to the private sector to move people from welfare to work.", "Now we have to create those jobs, now that we're requiring people to go do work.", "A commitment to continuing step-by-step healthcare reform with the next step helping people who are between jobs to access healthcare and not lose it just because they are out of work for a while.", "A commitment to grow the economy while protecting the environment.", "That's what I'd like them to know about me; that I've gotten up every day and worked for the American people and worked so that their children could have their dreams come true.", "And I believe we've got the results to show we're on the right track.", "The most important thing is, I believe we've got the right ideas for the future.", "And I like, I like Senator Dole, you can probably tell we like each other.", "We just see the world in different ways.", "And you folks out there are going to have to choose who you think is right.", " Well, I'd say the first homeless bill in the Senate was the Dole-Byrd Byrd-Dole bill, I can't remember who was in control then.", "I remember working with Senator Ribicoff from Connecticut on the Hospice program.", "We now have 2500 hospices.", "As I said, I've worked all my life when I was in the Congress.", "I left on June 11th because I wanted the American people to know that I was willing to give up something.", "President Clinton ran for governor in 1990 and said he's going to fill out his term, but he didn't.", "He's president so I guess it's a little better deal.", "But I wanted the American people to know I was willing to give up something.", "I wasn't just getting more power and more power.", "So I rolled the dice, I put my career on the line because I really believe the future of America is on the line.", "We can give you all these numbers, they don't mean a thing.", "If you are out of work, you have nothing to eat or you can't have medical care, or you're holding a crack baby in your arms right now, what do you do next?", "You know, America's best days are ahead of us.", "I've seen the tough times, I know they can be better and I'll lead America to a brighter future.", " Let's look at that.", "When I ran for president, I said we'd cut the deficit in half in four years; we cut it by 60 percent.", "I said that our economic plan would produce eight million jobs, we have ten and a half million new jobs.", "We're number one in autos again, record numbers of new small businesses.", "I said we'd put, pass a crime bill that would put 100,000 police on the street, ban assault weapons, and deal with the problems that ought to be dealt with with capital punishment, including capital punishment for drug kingpins, and we did that.", "I said we would change the way welfare works, and even before the bill passed we'd moved nearly two million people from welfare to work, working with states and communities.", "I said we'd get tougher with child support and child support enforcement's up 50 percent.", "I said that I would work for tax relief for middle class Americans.", "The deficit was bigger than I thought it was going to be.", "I think they're better off, all of us are, that we got the interest rates down and the deficit down.", "Republicans talk about it, but we're the first the first administration in anybody's lifetime looking at this program to bring that deficit down four years in a row.", "We still gave tax cuts to 15 million working Americans, and now I've got a plan that's been out there for two years, it could have been passed already, but instead the Republicans shut the government down to try to force their budget and their plan on me, and I couldn't take that.", "But we'll get the rest of that tax relief.", "And so I think when you look at those results, you know the plan I've laid out for the future has a very good chance of being enacted if you'll give me a chance to build that bridge to the 21st Century.", " Well, there he goes again, that line has been used before, I mean, exaggerating all the things that he did.", "He didn't do all these things.", "Let's take all these four years in a

going to work directly with the governors to get power back to the people and back to the states.", " I think a lot of people deserve credit and I've tried to give it to them.", "But I believe that my plan is better than Senator Dole's ill-advised $550 billion scheme which I'll say again will blow a hole in the deficit.", "Our plan will balance the budget, grow the economy, preserve the environment, and invest in education.", "We have the right approach for the future and looks at the results.", "It is not midnight in America, Senator.", "We are better off than we were four years ago.", " Well, first, Jim, let me thank you and thank you, Senator Dole, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, all of you listening tonight for the chance you've given us to appear.", "I want to say in the beginning that I am profoundly grateful for the chance that you have given me to serve as president for the last four years.", "I never could have dreamed anything like this would come my way in

glad we're going in the right direction.", "And I've done my best tonight to lay out my plans for going forward to an even better future in the next century.", "I'd like to leave you with the thought that the things I do as president are basically driven by the people whose lives I have seen affected by what does or doesn't happen in this country.", "The auto worker in Toledo who was unemployed

support, I ask for your help.", "And if you really want to get involved, just tap into my home page, www.DoleKemp96.org.", "Thank you.", "God bless America.", " I have a plan -- not a secret plan.", "As a matter of fact, it is the economic recovery program that we presented when I took office in 1981.", "It is true that earlier, working with some very prominent economists, I had come up, during the campaign, with an economic program that I thought could rectify the great problems confronting us -- the double-digit inflation, the high tax rates that I think were hurting the economy, the stagflation that we were undergoing.", "Before even the election day, something that none of those economists had even predicted had happened, that the economy was so worsened that I was openly saying that what we had thought on the basis of our plan could have brought a balanced budget -- no, that was no longer possible.", "So, the plan that we have had and that we are following is a plan that is based on growth in the economy, recovery without inflation, and reducing the share that the Government is taking from the gross national product, which has become a drag on the economy.", "Already, we have a recovery that has been going on for about 21 months to the point that we can now call it an expansion.", "Under that, this year, we have seen a $21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year, based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates.", "Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery.", "We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was.", "The interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points and, we think, must come down further.", "In the last 21 months, more than 6 million people have gotten jobs -- there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working, where there were only 99 million before; 107, if you count the military.", "So, we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending -- the increase, rate of increase in government spending, which has come down from 17 to 6 percent, and, at the same time, as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets, without raising taxes, those two lines will meet.", "And when they meet, that is a balanced budget.", " The deficit is the result of excessive government spending.", "I do not, very frankly, take seriously the Congressional Budget Office projections, because they have been wrong on virtually all of them, including the fact that our recovery wasn't going to take place to begin with.", "But it has taken place.", "But, as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent.", "If the rate of increase in government spending can be held at 5 percent -- we're not far from there -- by 1989 that would have reduced the budget deficits down to a $30 or $40 billion level.", "At the same time, if we can have a 4-percent recovery continue through that same period of time, that will mean -- without an increase in tax rates -- that will mean $400 billion more in government revenues.", "And so, I think that the lines can meet.", "Actually, in constant dollars, in the domestic side of the budget, there has been no spending increase in the 4 years that we have been here.", " One of the key tests of leadership is whether one sees clearly the nature of the problems confronted by our nation.", "And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits.", "I respect the President; I respect the Presidency, and I think he knows that.", "But the fact of it is, every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars.", "As a matter of fact, over 4 years, they've missed the mark by nearly $600 billion.", "We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983.", "It was $200 billion deficit instead.", "And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether we'll deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery.", "Virtually every economic analysis that I've heard of, including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a $263 billion deficit.", "In other words, it doesn't converge as the President suggests.", "It gets larger even with growth.", "What that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade.", "This is the worst trade year in American history by far.", "Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation.", "Real interest rates -- the real cost of interest -- will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that we're moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession.", "I get it down to a level below 2 percent of gross national product with a policy that's fair.", "I've stood up and told the American people that I think it's a real problem, that it can destroy long-term economic growth, and I've told you what I think should be done.", "I think this is a test of leadership, and I think the American people know the difference.", " Absolutely, and I proposed over a hundred billion dollars in cuts in Federal spending over 4 years, but I am not going to cut it out of Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and things -- [applause] -- that people need.", "These people depend upon all of us for the little security that they have, and I'm not going to do it that way.", "The rate of defense spending increase can be slowed.", "Certainly we can find a coffeepot that costs something less than $7,000.", "And there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in American life.", "And that's why the Congress, including the Republicans, have not gone along with the President's recommendations.", " Yes.", "I don't believe that Mr. Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget; he has a plan for raising taxes.", "And, as a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history took place 1977.", "And for the 5 years previous to our taking office, taxes doubled in the United States, and the budgets increased $318 billion.", "So, there is no ratio between taxing and balancing a budget.", "Whether you borrow the money or whether you simply tax it away from the people, you're taking the same amount of money out of the private sector, unless and until you bring down government's share of what it is taking.", "With regard to Social Security, I hope there'll be more time than just this minute to mention that, but I will say this: A President should never say \"never.''", "But I'm going to violate that rule and say \"never.''", "I will never stand for a reduction of the Social Security benefits to the people that are now getting them.", " Well, that's exactly the commitment that was made to the American people in 1980: He would never reduce benefits.", "And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut Social Security benefits by 25 percent -- reducing the adjustment for inflation, cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on Social Security, removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying -- with widows trying to get them through college.", "Everybody remembers that; people know what happened.", "There's a difference.", "I have fought for Social Security and Medicare and for things to help people who are vulnerable all my life, and I will do it as President of the United States.", " Well, first of all, I think the first answer this evening suggests exactly what I'm saying.", "There is no question that we face this massive deficit, and almost everybody agrees unless we get it down, the chances for long-term, healthy growth are nil.", "And it's also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children.", "The President says it will disappear overnight because of some reason.", "No one else believes that's the case.", "I do, and I'm standing up to the issue with an answer that's fair.", "I think that's what leadership is all about.", "There's a difference between being a quarterback and a cheerleader, and when there's a real problem, a President must confront it.", "What I was referring to, of course, in the comment that you referred to was the situation in Lebanon.", "Now, for three occasions, one after another, our Embassies were assaulted in the same way by a truck with demolitions.", "The first time -- and I did not criticize the President, because these things can happen -- once, and sometimes twice -- the second time the barracks in Lebanon were assaulted, as we all remember.", "There was two or three commission reports, recommendations by the CIA, the State Department, and the others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves.", "Now, I believe that a President must command that White House and those who work for him.", "It's the toughest job on Earth, and you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done.", "I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is what's needed, because all my life that has been the way in which I have sought to lead.", "And that's why in this campaign I'm telling you exactly what I want to do.", "I am answering your questions.", "I am trying to provide leadership now, before the election, so that the American people can participate in that decision.", " Well, I think we're getting better all the time.", "And I think tonight, as we contrast for the first time our differing approach to government, to values, to the leadership in this country, I think as this debate goes forward, the American people will have for the first time a chance to weigh the two of us against each other.", "And I think, as a part of that process, what I am trying to say will come across, and that is that we must lead, we must command, we must direct, and a President must see it like it is.", "He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for, and he must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world.", " Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor, since you've asked it.", "And, incidentally, I might say that with regard to the 25-percent cut in Social Security -- before I get to the answer to your question -- the only 25-percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase, was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916.", "Now, leadership.", "First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in.", "In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society -- that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society.", "Now, having that, I think also that in leadership -- well, I believe that you find people, positions such as I'm in who have the talent and ability to do the things that are needed in the various departments of government.", "I don't believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who's going to play tennis on the White House court.", "And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy, not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job.", "You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job.", "But I also believe something else about that.", "I believe that -- and when I became Governor of California, I started this, and I continue it in this office -- that any issue that comes before me, I have instructed Cabinet members and staff they are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue.", "I don't want to hear them.", "I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people -- is it morally right?", "And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue.", "Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they weren't to be abhorred -- that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment.", " Our policy was not to cut subsidies.", "We have believed in partnership, and that was an example of a partnership between, not only local government and the Federal Government but also between the private sector that built that particular structure.", "And this is what we've been trying to do, is involve the Federal Government in such partnerships.", "We are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people, and we're going to continue along that line.", "We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow, whether because of age or need.", "We have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country, and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need.", "The safety net is there, and we're taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country.", " Well, I guess I'm reminded a little bit of what Will Rogers once said about Hoover.", "He said, \"It's not what he doesn't know that bothers me; it's what he knows for sure that just ain't so.''", "[Laughter] The fact of it is: The President's budget sought to cut Social Security by 25 percent.", "It's not an opinion; it's a fact.", "And when the President was asked the other day, \"What do you want to cut in the budget?", "'', he said, \"Cut those things I asked for but didn't get.''", "That's Social Security and Medicare.", "The second fact is that the housing unit for senior citizens that the President dedicated in Buffalo was only made possible through a Federal assistance program for senior citizens that the President's budget sought to terminate.", "So, if he'd had his way, there wouldn't have been any housing project there at all.", "This administration has taken a meat cleaver out, in terms of Federal-assisted housing, and the record is there.", "We have to see the facts before we can draw conclusions.", " Well, let me just respond with regard to Social Security.", "When we took office, we discovered that the program that the Carter-Mondale administration had said would solve the fiscal problems of Social Security for the next 50 years wouldn't solve them for 5.", "Social Security was due to go bankrupt before 1983.", "Any proposals that I made at that time were at the request of the chairman, a Democrat, of one of the leading committees, who said we have to do something before the program goes broke and the checks bounce.", "And so, we made a proposal.", "And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign.", "And 3 days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said, Social Security, we know, is broke.", "Indeed, we had to borrow $17 billion to pay the checks.", "And then I asked for a bipartisan commission, which I'd asked for from the beginning, to sit down and work out a solution.", "And so, the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation, and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century.", " Well, I was raised to have a faith and a belief and have been a member of a church since I was a small boy.", "In our particular church, we did not use that term, \"born again,'' so I don't know whether I would fit that -- that particular term.", "But I have -- thanks to my mother, God rest her soul -- the firmest possible belief and faith in God.", "And I don't believe -- I believe, I should say, as Lincoln once said, that I could not -- I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others.", "And I do resort to prayer.", "At the same time, however, I have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign -- or religion a part of that campaign.", "As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr. Mondale's running mate said I wasn't a good Christian.", "So, it does play a part in my life.", "I have no hesitancy in saying so.", "And, as I say, I don't believe that I could carry on unless I had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered.", " The answer to your question is very simple about why I don't go to church.", "I have gone to church regularly all my life, and I started to here in Washington.", "And now, in the position I hold and in the world in which we live, where Embassies do get blown up in Beirut -- we're supposed to talk about that on the debate the 21st, I understand -- but I pose a threat to several hundred people if I go to church.", "I know the threats that are made against me.", "We all know the possibility of terrorism.", "We have seen the barricades that have had to be built around the White House.", "And, therefore, I don't feel -- and my minister knows this and supports me in this position -- I don't feel that I have a right to go to church, knowing that my being there could cause something of the kind that we have seen in other places, in Beirut, for example.", "And I miss going to church, but I think the Lord understands.", "[Applause]", " First of all, I accept President Reagan's affirmation of faith.", "I'm sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith, and we are strengthened, all of us, by that fact.", "I am a son of a Methodist minister.", "My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister.", "And I don't know if I've been born again, but I know I was born into a Christian family.", "And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency.", "Whether that helps or not, I don't know.", "I have a deep religious faith.", "Our family does.", "It is fundamental.", "It's probably the reason that I'm in politics.", "I think our faith tells us, instructs us, about the moral life that we should lead.", "And I think we're all together on that.", "What bothers me is this growing tendency to try to use one's own personal interpretation of faith politically, to question others' faith, and to try to use the instrumentalities of government to impose those views on others.", "All history tells us that that's a mistake.", "When the Republican platform says that from here on out, we're going to have a religious test for judges before they're selected for the Federal court, and then Jerry Falwell announces that that means they get at least two Justices of the Supreme Court, I think that's an abuse of faith in our country.", "This nation is the most religious nation on Earth -- more people go to church and synagogues than any other nation on Earth -- and it's because we kept the politicians and the state out of the personal exercise of our faith.", "That's why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians.", "And I think if we want to continue -- as I do -- to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it.", " No.", "What I object to -- [applause] -- what I object to -- what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others.", "A minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do that, I admire.", "The fact that the faith speaks to us and that we are moral people, hopefully, I accept and rejoice in.", "It's when you try to use that to undermine the integrity of private political -- or private religious faith and the use of the state is where -- for the most personal decisions in American life -- that's where I draw the line.", " Yes, it's very difficult to rebut, because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale.", "I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there.", "The only attacks I have made are on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side, using the government, using the power of the courts and so forth to hinder that part of the Constitution that says the government shall not only not establish a religion, it shall not inhibit the practice of religion.", "And they have been using these things to have government, through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion.", "A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they can't do it because it's school property.", "These are they types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation, and I am opposed to that.", "With regard to a platform on the Supreme Court, I can only say one thing about that.", "I have appointed one member to the Supreme Court: Sandra Day O'Connor.", "I'll stand on my record on that.", "And if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, I'll do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her.", " The platform to which the President refers, in fact, calls for a religious test in the selection of judges.", "And Jerry Falwell says that means we get two or three judges.", "And it would involve a religious test for the first time in American life.", "Let's take the example that the President cites.", "I believe in prayer.", "My family prays.", "We've never had any difficulty finding time to pray.", "But do we want a constitutional amendment adopted of the kind proposed by the President that gets the local politicians into the business of selecting prayers that our children must either recite in school or be embarrassed and asked to excuse themselves?", "Who would write the prayer?", "What would it say?", "How would it be resolved when those disputes occur?", "It seems to me that a moment's reflection tells you why the United States Senate turned that amendment down, because it will undermine the practice of honest faith in our country by politicizing it.", "We don't want that.", " My answer is that this campaign isn't over yet.", "And when people vote, I think you're going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favor the approach that I'm talking about.", "The American people want arms control.", "They don't want this arms race.", "And they don't want this deadly new effort to bring weapons into the heavens.", "And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world.", "The American people see this debt, and they know it's got to come down.", "And if it won't come down, the economy's going to slow down, maybe go into a recession.", "They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history.", "And they know this debt must come down as well, because it's unfair to our children.", "The American people want this environment protected.", "They know that these toxic waste dumps should have been cleaned up a long time ago, and they know that people's lives and health are being risked, because we've had an administration that has been totally insensitive to the law and the demand for the protection of the environment.", "The American people want their children educated.", "They want to get our edge back in science, and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap that's widening between the United States and Europe and Japan.", "The American people want to keep opening doors.", "They want those civil rights laws enforced.", "They want the equal rights amendment ratified.", "They want equal pay for comparable effort for women.", "And they want it because they've understood from the beginning that when we open doors, we're all stronger, just as we were at the Olympics.", "I think as you make the case, the American people will increasingly come to our cause.", " Well, tonight we had the first debate over the deficit.", "The President says it'll disappear automatically.", "I've said it's going to take some work.", "I think the American people will draw their own conclusions.", "Secondly, I've said that I will not support the cuts in Social Security and Medicare and the rest that the President has proposed.", "The President answers that it didn't happen or, if it did, it was resolved later in a commission.", "As the record develops, I think it's going to become increasingly clear that what I am saying and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go, and the comparison of approaches is such that I think will lead to further strength.", " Well, again, I'm running on the record.", "I think sometimes Mr. Mondale's running away from his.", "But I'm running on the record of what we have asked for.", "We'll continue to try to get things that we didn't get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 6.1 percent, a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and State governments that has been unjustly seized by the Federal Government.", "And you might find those words in a Democratic platform of some years ago -- I know, because I was a Democrat at that time.", "And I left the party eventually, because I could no longer follow the turn in the Democratic leadership that took us down an entirely different path, a path of centralizing authority in the Federal Government, lacking trust in the American people.", "I promised, when we took office, that we would reduce inflation.", "We have, to one-third of what it was.", "I promised that we would reduce taxes.", "We did, 25 percent across the board.", "That barely held even with -- if it did that much -- with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977.", "But at least it took that burden away from them.", "I said that we would create jobs for our people, and we did -- 6 million in the last 20 or 21 months.", "I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons.", "We have done that.", "All of the things that I said we would do, from inflation being down, interest rates being down, unemployment falling, all of those things we have done.", "And I think this is something the American people see.", "I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education -- on excellence in education.", "And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems.", "We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth.", "All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.", "So, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw: The leadership isn't taking us where we want to go.", " There are tasks that government legitimately should enforce and tasks that government performs well, and you've named some of them.", "Crime has come down the last 2 years, for the first time in many, many decades that it has come down -- or since we've kept records -- 2 consecutive years, and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that we've had.", "I think that we've had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide.", "The environment?", "Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment.", "When we took office, we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features, that we stopped buying additional park land until we had rectified this with what was to be a 5-year program -- but it's just about finished already -- a billion dollars.", "And now we're going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks.", "We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges.", "I think that we're out in front of most -- and I see that the red light is blinking, so I can't continue.", "But I've got more.", " The President says that when the Democratic Party made its turn, he left it.", "The year that he decided we had lost our way was the year that John F. Kennedy was running against Richard Nixon.", "I was chairman of \"Minnesotans for Kennedy;'' President Reagan was chairman of a thing called \"Democrats for Nixon.''", "Now, maybe we made a wrong turn with Kennedy, but I'll be proud of supporting him all of my life.", "And I'm very happy that John Kennedy was elected, because John Kennedy looked at the future with courage, saw what needed to be done, and understood his own government.", "The President just said that his government is shrinking.", "It's not.", "It's now the largest peacetime government ever in terms of the take from the total economy.", "And instead of retreating -- instead of being strong where we should be strong, he wants to make it strong and intervene in the most private and personal questions in American life.", "That's where government should not be.", " Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President, I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States.", "And so, my change had come earlier than that.", "I hadn't gotten around to reregistering as yet.", "I found that was rather difficult to do.", "But I finally did it.", "There are some other things that have been said here -- back, and you said that I might be able to dredge them up.", "Mr. Mondale referred to the farmers' worst year.", "The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done.", "The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 21\\1/2\\-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier.", "All of these things are presently being rectified, and I think that we are going to salvage the farmers.", "As a matter of fact, there has been less than one-quarter of 1 percent of foreclosures of the 270,000 loans from government that the farmers have.", " I have believed that in the appointment of judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they respect the sanctity of human life.", "Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life.", "But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is -- there's been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government.", "With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it's a problem of the Constitution.", "I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us.", "And I think that this is what we should concentrate on, is trying -- I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee, there were medical authorities, there were religious -- there were clerics there -- everyone talking about this matter of prolife.", "And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive.", "We have seen premature births that are now grown-up, happy people going around.", "Also, there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life.", "In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor -- signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder.", "Now, isn't it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child, and it was abortion and not murder, but if somebody else does it, that's murder?", "And it used the term \"death of the unborn child.''", "So, this has been my feeling about abortion, that we have a problem now to determine -- and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being.", " The laws regarding that always were State laws.", "It was only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that the Federal Government intervened in what had always been a State policy.", "Our laws against murder are State laws.", "So, I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this.", "As I say, I feel that we have a problem here to resolve.", "And no one has approached it from that matter.", "It does not happen that the church that I belong to had that as part of its dogma.", "I know that some churches do.", "Now, it is a sin if you're taking a human life.", "At the same time, in our Judeo-Christian tradition, we recognize the right of taking a human life in self-defense.", "And therefore, I've always believed that a mother, if medically it is determined that her life is at risk if she goes through with the pregnancy, she has a right then to take the life of even her own unborn child in defense of her own.", " This is one of the most emotional and difficult issues that could possibly be debated.", "I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people.", "The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest.", "Is it really the view of the American people, however you feel on the question of abortion, that government ought to be reaching into your livingrooms and making choices like this?", "I think it cannot work, won't work, and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law.", "Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them.", "The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do.", "I think these questions are inherently personal and moral, and every individual instance is different.", "Every American should be aware of the seriousness of the step.", "But there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do.", "Now, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion.", "Somebody went to a woman and nearly killed her.", "That's always been a serious crime and always should be a serious crime.", "But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped?", "Do we really want those decisions made by judges who've been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty?", "I don't think so, and I think it's going in exactly the wrong direction.", "In America, on basic moral questions we have always let the people decide in their own personal lives.", "We haven't felt so insecure that we've reached for the club of state to have our point of view.", "It's been a good instinct.", "And we're the most religious people on Earth.", " President Reagan, as Governor of California, signed a bill which is perhaps the most liberal proabortion bill of any State in the Union.", " The basic decision of the Supreme Court is that each person has to make this judgment in her own life, and that's the way it's been done.", "And it's a personal and private, moral judgment.", "I don't know the answer to when life begins.", "And it's not that simple, either.", "You've got another life involved.", "And if it's rape, how do you draw moral judgments on that?", "If it's incest, how do you draw moral judgments on that?", "Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment?", "It won't work.", "[Applause]", " Yes.", "Well, with regard to this being a personal choice, isn't that what a murderer is insisting on, his or her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that?", "Now, I'm not capable, and I don't think you are, any of us, to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life.", "I am simply saying that I believe that that's where the effort should be directed -- to make that determination.", "I don't think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition.", "That, too, would have to be worked out then, when you once recognize that we're talking about a life.", "But in this great society of ours, wouldn't it make a lot more sense, in this gentle and kind society, if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child, that instead we make it available for the adoption?", "There are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who can't have them any other way.", " I agree with that, and that's why I was a principal sponsor of a liberal adoption law, so that more of these children could come to term, so that the young mothers were educated, so we found an option, an alternative.", "I'm all for that.", "But the question is whether this other option proposed by the President should be pursued.", "And I don't agree with it.", "Since I've got about 20 seconds, let me just say one thing.", "The question of agriculture came up a minute ago.", "Net farm income is off 50 percent in the last 3 years, and every farmer knows it.", "And the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo, which has caused farm exports to drop 20 percent.", "It's been a big failure.", "I opposed the grain embargo in my administration.", "I'm opposed to these policies as well.", " In my opinion, as we deal with this deficit, people from about $70,000 a year on down have to be dealt with very, very carefully, because they are the ones who didn't get any relief the first time around.", "Under the 1981 tax bill, people making $200,000 a year got $60,000 in tax relief over 3 years, while people making $30,000 a year, all taxes considered, got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up.", "That's why my proposal protects everybody from $25,000 a year or less against any tax increases, and treats those $70,000 and under in a way that is more beneficial than the way the President proposes with a sales tax or a flat tax.", "What does this mean in real life?", "Well, the other day, Vice President Bush disclosed his tax returns to the American people.", "He's one of the wealthiest Americans, and he's our Vice President.", "In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes.", "In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12.8 percent in taxes.", "That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work.", "I believe we need some fairness.", "And that's why I've proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people who've already got no relief or actually got a tax increase.", " The first thing is, everybody 25,000 and under would have no tax increase.", "Mr. Reagan, after the election, is going to have to propose a tax increase, and you will have to compare what he proposes.", "And his Secretary of the Treasury said he's studying a sales tax or a value-added tax.", "They're the same thing.", "They hit middle- and moderate-income Americans and leave wealthy Americans largely untouched.", "Up until about $70,000, as you go up the ladder, my proposals will be far more beneficial.", "As soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well, I'd like to see the total repeal of indexing.", "I don't think we can do that for a few years.", "But at some point, we want to do that as well.", " You know, I wasn't going to say this at all, but I can't help it.", "There you go again.", "[Laughter] I don't have a plan to tax -- or increase taxes.", "I'm not going to increase taxes.", "I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes.", "Now, I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed; it's that government is overfed.", "And I think that most of our people -- this is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up.", "And, as a matter of fact, it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes, those above $50,000 actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage-wise as did those from 50,000 down.", "From 50,000 down, those people paid two-thirds of the taxes, and those people got two-thirds of the tax cut.", "Now, the Social Security tax of '77 -- this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest.", "It had two features.", "It had several tax increases phased in over a period of time -- there are two more yet to come between now and 1989.", "At the same time every year, it increased the amount of money -- virtually every year, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there -- that was subject to that tax.", "Today it is up to about $38,000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for Social Security.", "And that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, 20 -- they're paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money.", "Now, I don't think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesn't work out that way.", "The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as I've said, and that has not been changed.", "But if you take it in numbers of dollars instead of percentage, yes, you could say, well, that person got 10 times as much as this other person.", "Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also.", "But if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board.", " Yes, I had used -- \"last resort'' would always be with me.", "If you got the Government down to the lowest level, that you yourself could say it could not go any lower and still perform the services for the people, and if the recovery was so complete that you knew you were getting the ultimate amount of revenues that you could get through that growth, and there was still some slight difference there between those two lines, then I had said once that, yes, you would have to then look to see if taxes should not be adjusted.", "I don't foresee those things happening, so I say with great confidence I'm not going to go for a tax.", "With regard to assailing Mr. Bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid, I think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there -- had to do, possibly, with the sale of his home, and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust.", "All of those are legally deductions, deductible in computing your tax, and it was a 1-year thing with him.", " Well, first of all, I gave him the benefit of the doubt on the house deal.", "I'm just talking about the 12.8 percent that he paid, and that's what's happening all over this country with wealthy Americans.", "They've got so many loopholes they don't have to pay much in taxes.", "Now, Mr. President, you said, \"There you go again,'' right?", " Yes.", " You remember the last time you said that?", " Mm-hmm.", " You said it when President Carter said that you were going to cut Medicare, and you said, \"Oh, no, there you go again, Mr.", "President.''", "And what did you do right after the election?", "You went out and tried to cut $20 billion out of Medicare.", "And so, when you say, \"There you go again'' -- people remember this, you know.", "[Laughter] And people will remember that you signed the biggest tax increase in the history of California and the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States, and what are you going to do?", "You've got a $260 billion deficit.", "You can't wish it away.", "You won't slow defense spending; you refuse to do that -- --", " Sorry.", " Yes.", "With regard to Medicare, no, but it's time for us to say that Medicare is in pretty much the same condition that Social Security was, and something is going to have to be done in the next several years to make it fiscally sound.", "And, no, I never proposed any $20 billion should come out of Medicare; I have proposed that the program we must treat with that particular problem.", "And maybe part of that problem is because during the 4 years of the Carter-Mondale administration medical costs in this country went up 87 percent.", " I gave you back some of that time.", "[Laughter]", " Well, some of those facts and figures just don't stand up.", "Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here.", "It has begun to decline, but it is still going up.", "On the other hand, women heads of household -- single women heads of household have -- for the first time there's been a turndown in the rate of poverty for them.", "We have found also in our studies that in this increase in poverty, it all had to do with their private earnings.", "It had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs.", "We are spending now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980.", "We're spending a third more on all of the -- well, all of the programs of human service.", "We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before -- 2,300,000 more are receiving them -- even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them.", "We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits.", "We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy.", "Some time ago, Mr. Mondale said something about education and college students and help of that kind.", "Half -- one out of two of the full-time college students in the United States are receiving some form of Federal aid.", "But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans.", "We didn't think that was right.", "And so, we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college, their family incomes were so low.", "So, there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been, taking care of more people than they ever have.", "7.7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest 20 percent of earnings -- 7.7 million have moved up into another bracket since our administration took over, leaving only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there had been more than 13 million.", " Yes.", " That had nothing to do with the other thing of talking about their needs or anything.", "I remember distinctly, I was segueing into another subject.", "I was talking about the things that have been accomplished, and that was referring to the revival of patriotism and optimism, the new spirit that we're finding all over America.", "And it is a wonderful thing to see when you get out there among the people.", "So, that was the only place that that was used.", "I did avoid, I'm afraid, in my previous answer, also, the idea of uneven, yes.", "There is no way that the recovery is even across the country, just as in the depths of the recession, there were some parts of the country that were worse off, but some that didn't even feel the pain of the recession.", "We're not going to rest and not going to be happy until every person in this country who wants a job can have one, until the recovery is complete across the country.", " Number one, we've got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed.", "Number two, we have to work with cities and others to help generate economic growth in those communities -- through the Urban Development Action Grant Program.", "I don't mind those enterprise zones; let's try them, but not as a substitute for the others.", "Certainly education and training is crucial.", "If these young Americans don't have the skills that make them attractive to employees, they're not going to get jobs.", "The next thing is to try to get more entrepreneurship in business within the reach of minorities so that these businesses are located in the communities in which they're found.", "The other thing is, we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth.", "There is no question that the poor are worse off.", "I think the President genuinely believes that they're better off.", "But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago.", "How you can cut school lunches, how you can cut student assistance, how you can cut housing, how you can cut disability benefits, how you can do all of these things and then the people receiving them -- for example, the disabled, who have no alternative -- how they're going to do better, I don't know.", "Now, we need a tight budget, but there's no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and they're hurting.", "One final point if I might.", "There's another part of the lopsided economy that we're in today, and that is that these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports.", "We are now $120 billion of imports, 3 million jobs lost, and farmers are having their worst year.", "That's another reason to get the deficit down.", " I think the American people want to make certain that that dollar is wisely spent.", "I think they stand for civil rights.", "I know they're all for education in science and training, which I strongly support.", "They want these young people to have a chance to get jobs and the rest.", "I think the business community wants to get involved.", "I think they're asking for new and creative ways to try to reach it with everyone involved.", "I think that's part of it.", "I think also that the American people want a balanced program that gives us long-term growth so that they're not having to take money that's desperate to themselves and their families and give it to someone else.", "I'm opposed to that, too.", " Yes.", "The connection that's been made again between the deficit and the interest rates -- there is no connection between them.", "There is a connection between interest rates and inflation, but I would call to your attention that in 1981 while we were operating still on the Carter-Mondale budget that we inherited -- that the interest rates came down from 21\\1/2\\, down toward the 12 or 13 figure.", "And while they were coming down, the deficits had started their great increase.", "They were going up.", "Now, if there was a connection I think that there would be a different parallel between deficits getting larger and interest rates going down.", "The interest rates are based on inflation.", "And right now I have to tell you I don't think there is any excuse for the interest rates being as high as they are because we have brought inflation down so low.", "I think it can only be that they're anticipating or hope -- expecting, not hoping, that maybe we don't have a control of inflation and it's going to go back up again.", "Well, it isn't going to go back up.", "We're going to see that it doesn't.", "And I haven't got time to answer with regard to the disabled.", " Mr. President, if I heard you correctly, you said that these deficits don't have anything to do with interest rates.", "I will grant you that interest rates were too high in 1980, and we can have another debate as to why -- energy prices and so on.", "There's no way of glossing around that.", "But when these huge deficits went in place in 1981, what's called the real interest rates -- the spread between inflation and what a loan costs you doubled -- and that's still the case today.", "And the result is interest costs that have never been seen before in terms of real charges, and it's attributable to the deficit.", "Everybody -- every economist, every businessman -- believes that.", "Your own Council of Economic Advisers -- Mr. Feldstein in his report told you that.", "Every chairman of the Finance and Ways and Means Committee, Republican leaders in the Senate and the House are telling you that.", "That deficit is ruining the long-term hopes for this economy.", "It's causing high interest rates.", "It's ruining us in trade.", "It's given us the highest small business failure in 50 years.", "The economy is starting downhill with housing failure -- --", " Do you want to give me some suggestions?", "[Laughter] I'm going to use my time a little differently.", "I'm going to give the President some credit.", "I think the President has done some things to raise the sense of spirit, morale, good feeling in this country, and he's entitled to credit for that.", "What I think we need, however, is not just that but to move forward, not just congratulating ourselves but challenging ourselves to get on with the business of dealing with America's problems.", "I think in education, when he lectured the country about the importance of discipline, I didn't like it at first, but I think it helped a little bit.", "But now we need both that kind of discipline and the resources and the consistent leadership that allows this country to catch up in education and science and training.", "I like President Reagan.", "And this is not personal -- there are deep differences about our future, and that's the basis of my campaign.", " Without any doubt, I have stood up and told the American people that that $263 billion deficit must come down.", "And I've done what no candidate for President has ever done, I told you before the election what I'd do.", "Mr. Reagan, as you saw tonight -- President Reagan takes the position it will disappear by magic.", "It was once called voodoo economics.", "I wish the President would say: Yes, the CBO is right.", "Yes, we have a $263 billion deficit.", "This is how I'm going to get it done.", "Don't talk about growth, because even though we need growth, that's not helping.", "It's going to go in the other direction, as they've estimated.", "And give us a plan.", "What will you cut?", "Whose taxes will you raise?", "Will you finally touch that defense budget?", "Are you going to go after Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and the handicapped again as you did last time?", "If you'd just tell us what you're going to do, then the American people could compare my plan for the future with your plan.", "And that's the way it should be.", "The American people would be in charge.", " Well, now, I have to start with a smile, since his kind words to me.", "I'll tell you what I think has been the most outrageous thing in political dialog, both in this campaign and the one in '82.", "And that is the continued discussion and claim that somehow I am the villain who is going to pull the Social Security checks out from those people who are dependent on them.", "And why I think it is outrageous -- first of all, it isn't true.", "But why it is outrageous is because, for political advantage, every time they do that, they scare millions of senior citizens who are totally dependent on Social Security, have no place else to turn.", "And they have to live and go to bed at night thinking, \"Is this true?", "Is someone going to take our check away from us and leave us destitute?''", "And I don't think that that should be a part of political dialog.", "Now, to -- I still -- I just have a minute here?", " Oh, I -- --", " Okay.", "All right.", "Now, Social Security, let's lay it to rest once and for all.", "I told you never would I do such a thing.", "But I tell you also now, Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit.", "Social Security is totally funded by the payroll tax levied on employer and employee.", "If you reduce the out-go of Social Security, that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit.", "It would go into the Social Security Trust Fund.", "So, Social Security has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit.", "Now, again, to get to whether I am depending on magic, I think I have talked in straight economic terms about a program of recovery that I was told wouldn't work.", "And then, after it worked, I was told that lowering taxes would increase inflation.", "And none of these things happened.", "It is working, and we're going to continue on that same line.", "As to what we might do, and find in further savings cuts, no, we're not going to starve the hungry.", "But we have 2,478 specific recommendations from a commission of more than 2,000 business people in this country, through the Grace commission, that we're studying right now -- and we've already implemented 17 percent of them -- that are recommendations as to how to make government more efficient, more economic.", " Why the deficits are so much of a problem for him now, but that in 1976, when the deficit was $52 billion and everyone was panicking about that, he said, no, that he thought it ought to be bigger, because a bigger deficit would stimulate the economy and would help do away with unemployment.", "In 1979 he made similar statements, the same effect, that the deficits -- there was nothing wrong with having deficits.", "Remember, there was a trillion dollars in debt before we got here.", "That's got to be paid by our children and grandchildren, too, if we don't do it.", "And I'm hoping we can start some payments on it before we get through here.", "That's why I want another 4 years.", " Well, we've just finished almost the whole debate.", "And the American people don't have the slightest clue about what President Reagan will do about these deficits.", "[Laughter] And yet, that's the most important single issue of our time.", "I did support the '76 measure that he told about, because we were in a deep recession and we needed some stimulation.", "But I will say as a Democrat, I was a real piker, Mr. President.", "In 1979 we ran a $29 billion deficit all year.", "This administration seems to run that every morning.", "And the result is exactly what we see.", "This economy is starting to run downhill.", "Housing is off.", "Last report on new purchases, it's the lowest since 1982.", "Growth is a little over 3 percent now.", "Many people are predicting a recession.", "And the flow of imports into this country is swamping the American people.", "We've got to deal with this problem, and those of us who want to be your President should tell you now what we're going to do, so you can make a judgment.", " No, I might as well just go with -- --", " I don't think so.", "I'm all confused now.", " All right.", " Well, we'll include it in that.", " Four years ago, in similar circumstances to this, I asked you, the American people, a question.", " \"Are you better off than you were 4 years before?''", "The answer to that obviously was no, and as the result, I was elected to this office and promised a new beginning.", "Now, maybe I'm expected to ask that same question again.", "I'm not going to, because I think that all of you -- or not everyone, those people that are in those pockets of poverty and haven't caught up, they couldn't answer the way I would want them to -- but I think that most of the people in this country would say, yes, they are better off than

beginning.", "So far, it is only a beginning.", "If the job were finished, I might have thought twice about seeking reelection for this job.", "But we now have an economy that, for the first time -- well, let's put it this way: In the first half of 1980, gross national product was down a minus 3.7 percent.", "The first half of '84 it's up 8\\1/2\\ percent.", "Productivity in the first half of 1980 was down a minus 2 percent.", "Today it is up a plus 4 percent.", "Personal earnings after taxes per capita have gone up almost $3,000 in these 4 years.", "In 1980 -- or 1979, a person with a fixed income of $8,000 was $500 above the poverty line, and this maybe explains why there are the numbers still in poverty.", "By 1980 that same person was $500 below the poverty line.", "We have restored much of our economy.", "With regard to business investment, it is higher than it has been since 1949.", "So, there seems to be no shortage of investment capital.", "We have, as I said, cut the taxes, but we have reduced inflation, and for 2 years now it has stayed down there, not at double digit, but in the range of 4 or below.", "We believe that we had also promised that we would make our country more secure.", "Yes, we have an increase in the defense budget.", "But back then we had planes that couldn't fly for lack of spare parts or pilots.", "We had navy vessels that couldn't leave harbor because of lack of crew or, again, lack of spare parts.", "Today we're well on our way to a 600-ship navy.", "We have 543 at present.", "We have -- our military, the morale is high.", "I think the people should understand that two-thirds of the defense budget pays for pay and salary, or pay and pension.", "And then you add to that food and wardrobe, and all the other things, and you only have a small portion going for weapons.", "But I am determined that if ever our men are called on, they should have the best that we can provide in the manner of tools and weapons.", "There has been reference to expensive spare parts, hammers costing $500.", "Well, we are the ones who found those.", "I think we've given the American people back their spirit.", "I think there's an optimism in the land and a patriotism, and I think that we're in a position once again to heed the words of Thomas Paine, who said: \"We have it in our power to begin the world over again.''", " I want to thank the League of Women Voters and the city of Louisville for hosting this evening's debate.", "I want to thank President Reagan for agreeing to debate.", "He didn't have to, and he did, and we all appreciate it.", "The President's favorite question is: Are you better off?", "Well, if you're wealthy, you're better off.", "If you're middle income, you're about where you were.", "And if you're modest income, you're worse off.", "That's what the economists tell us.", "But is that really the question that should be asked?", "Isn't the real question is will we be better off?", "Will our children be better off?", "Are we building the future that this nation needs?", "I believe that if we ask those questions that bear on our future, not just congratulate ourselves but challenge us to solve those problems, you'll see that we need new leadership.", "Are we better of with this arms race?", "Will we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens?", "Are we better off when we deemphasize our values in human rights?", "Are we better off when we load our children with this fantastic debt?", "Would fathers and mothers feel proud of themselves if they loaded their children with debts like this nation is now -- over a trillion dollars on the shoulders of our children?", "Can we say, really say that we will be better off when we pull away from sort of that basic American instinct of decency and fairness?", "I would rather lose a campaign about decency than win a campaign about self-interest.", "I don't think this nation is composed of people who care only for themselves.", "And when we sought to assault Social Security and Medicare, as the record shows we did, I think that was mean-spirited.", "When we terminated 400,000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability -- confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for 4 years, I don't think that's what America is all about.", "America is a fair society, and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him.", "I believe there's fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system.", "I believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment.", "And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful.", "These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price.", "That's not fair for our future.", "I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training, because this world is more complex and we're being pressed harder all the time.", "I believe in opening doors.", "We won the Olympics, in part, because we've had civil rights laws and the laws that prohibit discrimination against women.", "I have been for those efforts all my life.", "The President's record is quite different.", "The question is our future.", "President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, \"We are great, but we can be greater.''", "We can be better if we face our future, rejoice in our strengths, face our problems, and by solving them, build a better society for our children.", "Thank you.", " I think we've seen a deterioration of values.", "I think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have condemned.", "For a while, as I recall, it even seems to me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana and other drugs, and I think that's all wrong.", "So we've seen a deterioration in values, and one of the things that I think we should do about it in terms of cause is to instill values into the young people in our schools.", "We got away, we got into this feeling that value- free education was the thing.", "And I don't believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use.", "And, of course, as far as the how we make it better, yes, we can do better on interdiction.", "But we've got to do a lot better on education, and we have to do, be tougher on those who commit crimes.", "We've got to get after the users more.", "We have to change this whole culture.", "You know, I saw a movie - \"Crocodile Dundee.\"", "And I saw the cocaine scene treated with humor, as though this was a humorous little incident.", "And it's bad.", "Everybody ought to be in this thing.", "Entertainment industry, people involved in the schools, education.", "And it isn't a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem.", "But we have got to instill values in these young people.", "And I have put forward a many-point drug program that includes what I would do as president of the United States; in terms of doing better on interdiction; and in terms of better in the neighborhoods.", "But I think we're all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.", " I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important.", "But it's important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top.", "That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves.", "Here we are with a government that's been dealing with a drug-running Panamanian dictator.", "We've been dealing with him; he's been dealing drugs to our kids.", "Governors like me and others have been trying to deal with the consequences.", "I remember being in a high school in my own state as we were organizing

woman with help.", "But I want to be a president of the United States who makes sure that we never again do business with a drug-running Panamanian dictator, that we never again funnel aid to the contras through convicted drug dealers.", "Values begin at the top, in the White House.", "Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.", " I'm saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention.", "And Mr. Bush is right - the two go hand in hand.", "But if our government itself is doing business with people who we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking, if we don't understand that that sends out a very, very bad message to our young people, it's a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that I talked about and to young people like her all over the country, and say to them we want to help you.", "Now, I've outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad, doubling the number of drug enforcement agents, having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together.", "But we also have to take demand seriously.", "You know, we have five percent of the world's population in this country.", "We're

country.", "We're helping youngsters; we're reaching out to them.", "And we're beginning with drug education and prevention beginning in the early elementary grades in every elementary school in our state, and that's the kind of effort we need in every elementary school in the United States of America.", "And we've got to begin early, in the first, second and third grade, before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very, very dangerous substances.", "I guess the question I would ask of Mr. Bush is how we instill those values, how we create this environment for the drug free schools that we want in this country.", "If he or representatives of the administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy, or don't pursue that connection in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an example to our kids all over the country.", " Well, the other day my opponent was given a briefing by the CIA.", "I asked for and received the same briefing.", "I am very careful in public life about dealing with classified information.", "And what I'm about to say is unclassified.", "Seven administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega.", "It was the Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man to justice.", "And as the governor of Massachusetts knows, there was no evidence that governor - that Mr. Noriega was involved in drugs, no hard evidence until we indicted him.", "And so I think it's about time we get this Noriega matter in perspective.", "Panama is a friendly country.", "I went down there and talked to the president of Panama about cleaning up their money laundering, and Mr. Noriega was there, but there was no evidence at that time, and when the evidence was there, we indicted him.", "And we want to bring him to justice.", "And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations.", " Yes, I've been very specific about those, John.", "And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down, because as a chief executive that's balanced ten budgets in a row, I've had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices.", "First, I've suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don't need and we can't afford.", "Mr. Bush has been critical of me for that, but I think those are the kinds of tough choices you have to make.", "I've also suggested that there are weapons systems that we should proceed on, and I've outlined those in detail.", "Secondly, we've got to invest in economic growth in this country, in every part of this country.", "Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit.", "Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down.", "And, finally, we've got to go out there and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren't being paid to this country.", "It's very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected.", "I've also suggested that on the domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts.", "We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which is what we've been doing under this administration.", "We can help people to live better lives, and at the same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare, and to become productive citizens again.", "The thing I don't understand about Mr. Bush's approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do.", "He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says he's against new taxes, although he's broken that pledge at least times in the last year that I know of; he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break.", "He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs.", "If he keeps this up, he's going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics.", "(Laughter)", " But I hope you won't take my five seconds away from me.", "I will say this -", " If he's serious about what he's saying, then the only place he can go to balance that budget is to raid the Social Security Trust Fund, and he tried that in 1985, and I think he's going to try it again.", " Is this the time to unleash our one-liners?", "That answer was about as clear as Boston harbor.", "(Laughter)", " Let me help the governor.", "There are so many things there, I don't quite know where to begin.", "When you cut capital gains, you put people to work.", "John Kennedy proposed cutting capital gains.", "Paul Tsongas, a liberal senator from Massachusetts said the dumbest thing I did was to oppose the capital gains cut.", "It's not going to cost the government money.", "It's going to increase revenues to the federal government, and it's going to create jobs.", "So that's one of the things that I think makes a big difference between us.", "Massachusetts doesn't have an enormous defense budget, but nevertheless, the governor raised taxes five different times.", "That happens to be a fact.", "And so let's kind of stay on the issue, and I have made a specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze.", "And it permits - economists on the East Coast and West think it's good - it permits the president to sort out the priorities, and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes.", " I think it's the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down.", "And presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down, but we've got to get the Democrats - Congress under control.", "They do all the spending, they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime.", "I'd like to ask the Governor to join in getting for the president what 43 governors have, the line-item veto.", "He has to operate in Massachusetts under a balanced budget proviso.", "I would like a balanced budget amendment.", "But the dynamics of the economy - we cut the taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years.", "So the problem is - it's not that the working is being taxed too little or the person working out - the woman working in some factory being taxed too little.", "It is that we are continuing to spend too much.", "So, my formula says grow at the rate of inflation.", "Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending.", "And remember the Federal deficit has come down $70 billion in one year, in 1987.", "And if we - and the - actually this year Congress is doing a little better in controlling the growth of spending.", "Spending was only up something like 4 percent.", "So, it isn't that we're taking too little - from taxpayer - we're spending too much still.", "And the formula I've given you works, we've put it through a good economic model, we've got good economists on the West Coast, Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there who's a very respected economist in the - Massachusetts.", "And they agree, that if we can do what I've said, we can get it down without going and socking the American taxpayer once again.", "Capital gains, one more point on that, please let's learn from history.", "A capital gains differential will increase jobs, increase risk taking, increase revenues to the Federal Government.", " Well, I hope all of those Americans out there who are watching us, listening to us and trying to make up their mind about which one of us ought to be president of the United States listen to the Vice President very carefully.", "What he's proposing after over a trillion in new debt which has been added in the Federal debt in the course of the past eight years, an IOU our children and grandchildren will be paying for years, is a tax cut for the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country, an average of about $30,000 that we're going to give to people making $200,000 a year.", "Why that's more than the average teacher makes.", "We've had enough of that, ladies and gentlemen.", "We've run up more debt in the last eight years than under all the presidents from George Washington to Jimmy Carter combined.", "It's time for a chief executive who can make tough choices, can work with the Congress, can get that deficit down and begin to build a strong fiscal foundation under this country.", " One thing I will not do is sock every business in the country and, thus, throw some people out of work.", "I want to keep this economic recovery going.", "More Americans at work today than any time in history, a greater percentage of the work force.", "What I will do is permit people to buy into Medicaid.", "I believe that's the answer.", "I am proud to have been part of an administration that past the first catastrophic health bill.", "And in that there are some Medicaid provisions that will be very helpful to the very kind of people we're talking about here.", "But we've got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work.", "So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program.", "It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then it also - I do not want to see us mandate across the board that every company has to do this, because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say, \"We can't make it.\"", "And I think then you're going to see that people are put out of work.", "All these programs - and this cost on his - is - was - I saw an estimate, I'd love to know what he thinks, $35 - $40 billion - and it seems to me that somebody pays that.", "There isn't any such thing as something free out there.", "It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work so the business can continue to compete.", "So, I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid system.", "I think we ought to do it by full enforcement of the catastrophic health insurance.", "I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience.", "It's a terrible problems in terms of flexibility on private insurance.", "But I just don't want to mandate it and risk putting this - setting the recovery back.", " But, George, that's no answer.", " You don't like the answer, but it's an answer.", " Well, no, it's no answer to those 37 million people, most of them members of working families who don't have a dime of health insurance and don't know how to pay the bills if their kids get sick at night.", "I was in Houston on Tuesday meeting with a group of good citizens, working citizens.", "All of them with little or no health insurance.", "One of them was a father who had been laid off a few months ago and lost his health insurance.", "Has an 11 year old son and can't let that son compete in sports and Little League, because he's afraid he's going to get hurt and he won't be able to provide health insurance to pay those bills.", "My state just became the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care and we did it with the support of the business community and labor and the health care community and with virtually everybody in the state.", "The fact of the matter is that employers who today are insuring their employees are paying the freight, because they're paying for those who aren't.", "And I think it's time that when you got a job in this country it came with health insurance.", "That's the way we're going to provide basic health security for all of the citizens of this country of ours.", " Well, Anne, let me just say before I answer your question that I didn't know that the Vice President attacked our program in Massachusetts.", "I hope he hasn't.", "Because has won the support of a great many people all over the state and I think it's a model for what I hope we can do across the country.", "But when I proposed my plan this past Tuesday, he or one of his spokesmen called it socialized medicine.", "The last time the Vice President used that phrase, I suspect he remembers it, don't you?", "It was in 1964 and that's what he called Medicare.", "Well, he was wrong then and he's wrong now.", "(Applause)", " Let me say this about AIDS.", "It's the single most important public health crisis, single most important public health emergency we've had in our lifetimes and I think there are a number of things we have to do including supporting legislation which is now moving through the Congress, which will commit this nation to the resources to find a cure which will provide broad education and prevention, which will provide sensitive and caring treatment for the victims of AIDS.", "I think we have to demonstrate some flexibility and I think the FDA is attempting to do so now in trying to make it possible for new and experimental drugs to be available to people who are at risk at AIDS and I would hope that we could bring that kind of a policy to bear beginning in January.", "And I would encourage the current administration to proceed with that kind of flexibility where it's appropriate and where it's done carefully and responsibly.", "But we have not had the kind of leadership we should have had.", "In this particular area, I think the Vice President and I are in general agreement on what we have to do.", "The special Federal commission made good solid recommendations.", "I think we're both supportive of them and I would strongly lead in that area as I have in my state as Governor.", " Well, we're on the right track.", "The NIH is doing a good job in research.", "The Surgeon General is doing a good job in encouraging the proper kind of education.", "I notice that the Governor did not mention any testing.", "But we got to have a knowledge base.", "Testing should be confidential, but we have to have a knowledge.", "We can't simply stick our heads in the sands in terms of testing.", "I'm Chairman of the President's Task Force on Regulatory Relief and we are working with the FDA and they have sped up bringing drugs to market that can help.", "And you got to be careful here, because there's a safety factor, but I think these things - and then also I am one who believes we've got to go the extra mile in clean - being sure that that blood supply is pure.", "We cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature.", "So, research, speeding the drugs to market, testing, blood supply are very important elements of this.", " Passionless?", " Well, I don't question his passion.", "I question - and I don't question his concern about the war in Vietnam.", "He introduced or supported legislation back then that suggested that kids of Massachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war.", "Now, that's a certain passion that in my view it's misguided passion.", "He - we have a big difference on issues.", "You see, last year in the primary, he expressed his passion.", "He said, \"I am a strong liberal Democrat\" - August, '87.", "Then he said, \"I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU.\"", "That was what he said.", "He is out there on out of the mainstream.", "He is very passionate.", "My argument with the governor is, do we want this country to go that far left.", "And I wish we had time to let me explain.", "But I salute him for his passion.", "We just have a big difference on where this country should be led, and in what direction it ought to go.", "(Applause)", " Nothings wrong with it.", "But just take a look at the positions of the ACLU.", "But, Peter, please understand, the liberals do not like me talking about liberal They don't like it when I say that he says he's a card carrying member.", "Now, if that quote was wrong, he can repudiate it, right here.", "I've seen it authoritatively written twice, and if I've done him an injustice, and he didn't say it, I'm very, very sorry.", "But I don't agree with a lot of - most of the positions of the ACLU.", "I simply don't want to see the ratings on movies.", "I don't want my ten year old grandchild to go into an X-rated movie.", "I like those ratings systems.", "I don't think they're right to try to take the tax exemption away from the Catholic Church.", "I don't want to see the kiddie pornographic laws repealed; I don't want to see \"under God\" come out from our currency.", "Now, these are all positions of the ACLU.", "And I don't agree with them.", "He has every right to exercise his passion, as what he said, a strong, progressive liberal.", "I don't agree with that.", "I come from a different point.", "And I think I'm more in touch with the mainstream of America.", "They raised the same thing with me on the Pledge of Allegiance.", "You see, I'd have found a way to sign that bill.", "Governor Thompson of Illinois did.", "I'm not questioning his patriotism.", "He goes out and says the man is questioning my patriotism.", "And then all the liberal columnists join in.", "I am not.", "I am questioning his judgment on these matters, or where he's coming from He has every right to do it.", "But I believe that's not what the American people want, and when he said, when he said at the convention, ideology doesn't matter, just competence, he was moving away from his own record, from what his passion has been over the years.", "And that's all I'm trying to do, is put it in focus.", "And I hope people don't think that I'm questioning his patriotism when I say he used his words to describe his participation in that organization.", " Well, I hope this is the first and last time I have to say this.", "Of course, the vice president is questioning my patriotism.", "I don't think there's any question about that, and I resent it.", "I resent it.", "My parents came to this country as immigrants.", "They taught me that this was the greatest country in the world.", "I'm in public service because I love this country.", "I believe in it.", "And nobody's going to question my patriotism as the vice president has now repeatedly.", "The fact of the matter is if the Pledge of Allegiance was the acid test of one's patriotism--the vice president's been the presiding officer in the United States Senate for the past seven and a half years.", "To the best of my knowledge he's never once suggested that a session of the Senate begin with the Pledge of Allegiance.", "(Applause)", " Mr. Bush, I don't question your patriotism.", "When you're attacked for your military record, I immediately said it was inappropriate, it had no place in this campaign, and I rejected it.", "I would hope that from this point on, we get to the issues that affect the vast majority of Americans, jobs, schools, health care, housing, the environment.", "Those are the concerns of the people that are watching us tonight.", "Not labels that we attach to each other, questions about each other's patriotism and loyalty.", " I want to see the McKinney Act fully funded.", "I believe that that would help in terms of shelter.", "I want to see - when I talked at our convention about a thousand points of light, I was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help.", "The governor's wife has been very active in the homeless.", "My campaign chairman, Secretary Jim Baker's wife.", "This isn't government.", "These are people that care, that are trying to give of themselves.", "The government has a role.", "It is to fully fund the McKinney Act.", "There are certain army bases that the act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when it's rough.", "And so I think that we're on the right track.", "I don't see this, incidentally, as a Democrat or a Republican or a liberal or conservative idea.", "I see an involvement by a thousand points of light.", "I see the funding that is required, and I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill.", "They gave it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work.", "And we're on the track on this one.", "But - and I, look, mental - that was a little overstated it.", "I'd say around 30 percent.", "And I think maybe we could look back over our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all those mental patients out.", "Maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them.", "Because there is a major problem there.", "A lot of them are mentally sick.", "And we've got to attend to them.", "But fully, my short range answer is fully fund that McKinney Act.", " Well, this is another fundamental difference that I have with the vice president, just as I do in the case of health care for 37 million members of working families in this country who don't have health insurance.", "The problem, Mr. Bush, is that you've cut back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and moderate income.", "And when you do that, you've have homeless families.", "We didn't have two and a half million, or three million homeless people living on streets and in doorways in this country ten years ago.", "We've got to begin to get back to the business of building and rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in this country; housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy.", "We've got communities in this country increasingly where our own kids can't afford to live in the communities that they grew up in.", "That's an essential commitment.", "And I think the housing community is ready.", "But it's going to take a president who's committed to housing, who's had experience in building and rehabilitating housing who understands that affordable housing for families of low and moderate income, for young families, first time home buyers, is an essential part of the American dream.", "And while I'm all for the McKinney bill, that, by itself, simply won't do.", "We've got to have a president that can lead on this issue, that can work with the Congress, and I'm prepared to do so.", "This is one of the most important priorities that faces this country.", " Well, I certainly hope not.", "And it's all a question of what our priorities are.", "Mr. Bush talked about values.", "I agree with him.", "What are our values?", "Isn't providing housing for families of low and moderate income, isn't it making possible for young families, first time home buyers to own their own home some day something that's part of the American dream?", "I think so.", "You know, back after World War II when we had hundreds of thousands of GIs who came back from the war, we didn't sit around.", "We went out and built housing.", "The government was very much involved; so was the housing industry; so was the banking industry; so were housing advocates; so were non-profit agencies; so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing.", "Now, that's the kind of leadership that I want to provide as president of the United States.", "This isn't a question of a little charity for the homeless.", "This is a question of organizing the housing community.", "I've talked to bankers and builders and developers, the housing advocates, community development agencies, and they want leadership from Washington.", "Washington, by itself, can't do it all.", "We shouldn't expect that.", "But governors are ready; mayors are ready.", "Builders and community leaders are ready.", "It will require some funds, John.", "And we ought to be prepared to provide those funds.", "But that, too, will require some choices.", "Mr. Bush wants to spend billions and trillions on Star Wars.", "Well, that's a choice we have to make, isn't it?", "Do we spend money on that weapon system in the billions and trillions, or is providing some decent and affordable housing for families of this country something that is at least as important and probably more so.", "Because it's so essential to our economic strength and to our future.", "Now, that's the kind of presidency I believe in.", "And simply to say, well, the McKinney bill will do it just doesn't do.", "We need a president who will lead on this issue, who has had experience on this issue.", "It's the kind of priority that will be at the top of our list beginning in January of 1989.", " I think the governor is blurring housing and the homeless.", "Let's talk about housing which the question was.", "When you talk to those bankers, did they discuss where interest rates were when your party controlled the White House?", "Ten days before I took the oath of office as president they were 21 and a half percent.", "Now, how does that grab you for increasing housing?", "Housing is up.", "We are serving a million more families now.", "But we're not going to do it in that old Democratic, liberal way of trying to build more bricks and mortars.", "Go out and take a look at St. Louis at some of that effort.", "It is wrong.", "I favor home ownership.", "I want to see more vouchers.", "I want to see control of some of these projects, and I want to keep the interest rates down.", "They're half, now of what they were when we came into office, and with my policy of getting this deficit under control, they'll be a lot less.", "But if we spend and spend and spend, that is going to wrap up the housing market, and we'll go right back to the days of the misery index and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome - thank God for the United States on that one.", " No, I don't think there is.", "There are two very different issues here, and they've got to be dealt with separately.", "I'm opposed to the death penalty.", "I think everybody knows that.", "I'm also very tough on violent crime.", "And that's one of the reasons why my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in America.", "It's one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in the country.", "It's one of the reasons why we have a drug education and prevention program that is reaching out and helping youngsters all over our state, the kind of thing I want to do as president of the United States.", "You know, the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country, which gave last year 7,000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to execute.", "The issue of abortion is a very difficult issue, one that I think that we all have to wrestle with, we have to come to terms with.", "I don't favor abortion.", "I don't think it's a good thing.", "I don't think most people do.", "The question is who makes the decision.", "And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.", " Well, the Massachusetts furlough program was unique.", "It was the only one in the nation that furloughed murderers who had not served enough time to be eligible for parole.", "The federal program doesn't do that.", "No other state programs do that.", "And I favor the death penalty.", "I know it's tough and honest people can disagree.", "But when a narcotics wrapped up guy goes in and murders a police officer, I think they ought to pay with their life.", "And I do believe it would be inhibiting.", "And so I am not going to furlough men like Willie Horton, and I would meet with their, the victims of his last escapade, the rape and the brutalization of the family down there in Maryland.", "Maryland would not extradite Willie Horton, the man who was furloughed, the murderer, because they didn't want him to be furloughed again.", "And so we have a fundamental difference on this one.", "And I think most people know my position on the sanctity of life.", "I favor adoption.", "I do not favor abortion.", " I haven't sorted out the penalties.", "But I do know, I do know that I oppose abortion.", "And I favor adoption.", "And if we can get this law changed, everybody should make the extraordinary effort to take these kids that are unwanted and sometimes aborted, take the - let them come to birth, and then put them in a family where they will be loved.", "And you see, yes, my position has evolved.", "And it's continuing to evolve, and it's evolving in favor of life.", "And I have had a couple of exceptions that I support - rape, incest and the life of the mother.", "Sometimes people feel a little uncomfortable talking about this, but it's much clearer for me now.", "As I've seen abortions sometimes used as a birth control device, for heavens sakes.", "See the millions of these killings accumulate, and this is one where you can have an honest difference of opinion.", "We certainly do.", "But no, I'm for the sanctity of life, and once that illegality is established, then we can come to grips with the penalty side, and of course there's got to be some penalties to enforce the law, whatever they may be.", " Well, I think what the vice president is saying is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this decision.", "It's as simple as that.", "I don't think it's enough to come before the American people who are watching us tonight and say, well, I haven't sorted it out.", "This is a very, very difficult and fundamental decision that all of us have to make.", "And what he is saying, if I understand him correctly, is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this choice.", " I just -", " Let me finish.", "Let me simply say that I think it has to be the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs that makes that decision, and I think that's the right approach, the right decision, and I would hope by this time that Mr. Bush had sorted out this issue and come to terms with it as I have.", "I respect his right to disagree with me.", "But I think it's important that we have a position, that we take it, and we state it to the American people.", " One of the reasons, and I first would like to know which programs you're talking about, and then we could talk on the merits of the programs.", "But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible.", "That might be the explanation, if you tell me the program.", "I do strongly support the WIC program.", "I think it is good.", "I think part of the answer to this haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid, to challenge the states, and maybe we're going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of these.", "But, Peter, so much of it is, gets into a whole other phase of things.", "The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in, and that leads me to the programs I'm talking about in terms of education.", "I think that part of it is the crime infested neighborhoods, and that's why I'm a strong believer in trying to control crimes in the neighborhood, why I was so pleased to be endorsed by the policemen on the beat, the Boston Police Department the other day.", "I think they understand my commitment to helping them in the neighborhoods.", "And so it's a combination of these things.", "But do not erode out of the system the thousand points of light.", "The people that are out there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and schools, the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty.", "I'm for Head Start and moving that up.", "And I've already made a proposal - and yes, it will cost some money.", "But I favor that.", "So these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I don't think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program.", " Well, I must have been living through a different eight years then the ones the vice president's been living through, because this administration has cut and slashed and cut and slashed programs for children, for nutrition, for the kinds of things that can help these youngsters to live better lives.", "It's cut federal aid to education; it's cut Pell grants and loans to close the door to college opportunity on youngsters all over this country.", "And that, too, is a major difference between the vice president and me.", "Let me just give you one other example.", "We have a great many people, hundreds of thousands of people living on public assistance in this country.", "The 50 governors of this nation have proposed to the Congress that we help those families to get off of welfare, help those youngsters, help their mothers to become independent and self-sufficient.", "It's taken months and months and months to get Mr. Bush and the administration to support that legislation, and they're still resisting.", "That's the way you help people.", "Being haunted, a thousand points of light - I don't know what that means.", "I know what strong political leadership is.", "I know what's happened over the course of the past eight years.", "These programs have been cut and slashed and butchered, and they've hurt kids all over this country.", " Well, I said a few minutes ago, Peter, that you could improve the lives of families and youngsters and save money at the same time.", "Welfare reform is one way to do it.", "If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids don't lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of families, to get off of welfare, to become independent and self-sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives, the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children.", "That's just one example of how you can save money and improve the quality of life at the same time.", "In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very unwisely.", "One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance.", "Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he can't play little league ball that he can't go out on the ball field because he's afraid he's going to get hurt.", "And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I don't think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital.", "So these are the ways that you help families, you help youngsters to live better lives, and more decent lives.", "Were ready to go to work at the state and local level, all of us.", "I know the private sector is.", "People are all over the country.", "But it takes presidential leadership.", "It takes a commitment to being involved and the leading.", "And that's the kind of presidency I want to lead.", " What troubles me is that when I talk of the voluntary sector and a thousand points of light and a thousand different ways to help on these problems, the man has just said he doesn't understand what I'm talking about.", "This is the problem I have with the big spending liberals.", "They think the only way to do it is for the federal government to do it all.", "The fact happens to be that education spending is up by the federal government; it is up.", "It is not down.", "But here's the point he misses.", "The federal government spends seven percent of the total on education, and the rest of the state governments and local governments and the thousand points of lightened I'm talking about private schools and private church schools and things of this nature--are putting up 93 percent.", "But the federal spending for education is up, and I want to be the education president, because I want to see us do better.", "We're putting more money per child into education, and we are not performing as we should.", "We've gotten away fro values and the fundamentals.", "And I would like to urge the school superintendents and the others around the country to stand up now and keep us moving forward on a path towards real excellence.", "And we can do it.", "But it\u00cf\u20acs not going to be dedicated by some federal bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.", " Of course not.", "Of course that's a charge that's always made against any governor who runs for the presidency.", "I think it was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980.", "Remember that, George?", "And yet some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest international leaders were governors-Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt.", "Its not the amount of time you spend in Washington.", "It's not the length of your resume.", "It's your strength, it's your values, it's the quality of the people you pick.", "It's your understanding of the forces of change that are sweeping the world, and whether or not you're in a position to provide leadership to make those forces of change work for us and not against us.", "The vice president has a long resume.", "But it didn't stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah.", "And we now know that he was not out of the loop; he was in meeting after meeting listening to Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger opposing that, and yet he supported it.", "His experience didn't prevent him from participating or involving or in some way being involved in the relationship between this government and Mr. Noriega and drug trafficking in Panama.", "He went to Philippines in the early 80\u00cf\u20acs and commended Ferdinand Macros for his commitment to democracy.", "And he continues to support a failed policy in Central America which is getting worse and worse, and which has in fact increased Cuban and Soviet influence in that region.", "So I don't believe that the fact you've got that long resume or had that experience is the real question.", "The question is values; the question is strength, the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provided.", "I'm ready to provide that leadership.", "I want to be the commander in chief of this country.", "I think it take fresh leadership now, and an understanding of those forces of change to provide the kind of strength that we need, and perhaps the vice president can explain what he was doing when he supported the trading of arms to terrorist nation, and his involvement in Panama and that endorsement of Mr. Macros.", "But I don't think it's just experience that makes the difference.", "It's strength; it's values.", " Well, I thought the question was about defense.", "The governor was for a nuclear freeze that would have locked in a thousand Soviet intermediate nuclear force weapons and zero for the West.", "And because we didn't listen to the freeze advocates, and strengthen the defense of this country, we now have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age.", "Now, we're sitting down and talking to the Soviets about strategic arms, and he wants to do away with the Midgetman and the MX, the modernization or our nuclear capability.", "That is not the way you deal with the Soviets.", "I've met Mr. Gorbachev.", "Met Mr. Shevardnadze and talked substance with him the other day.", "These people are tough.", "But now we have a chance.", "I few have experience and now how to handle it, but please do not go back to the days when the military was as weak as they could be, when the morale was down, and when we were the laughing stock around the world.", "And now we are back, because we have strengthened the defenses of this country, and believe me, I don't want to see us return to those days.", "As to Ferdinand Marcos, he isn't there any more.", "It was under our administration that Mrs. Aquino came in.", "But I'll tell you what I was thinking of.", "I flew a combat mission, my last one was over Manila.", "And he was down there fighting against imperialism.", "And he had just-", " And he just lifted martial law.", "And he just called for new elections.", "And all of those things happened because the Philippines do crave democracy.", "And out he goes.", " I don't think it's a question of eliminating.", "I can tell him some I'm against.", "A-6F, for example.", "DIVAD.", "And I can go on and on.", "Minuteman III, penetration systems.", "I mean, there's plenty of them that I oppose, but what I am not going to do, when we are negotiating with the Soviet Union, sitting down talking to Mr. Gorbachev about how we achieve a 50 percent reduction in our strategic weapons, I'm not going to give away a couple of aces I that very tough card game.", "I'm simply not going to do that.", "And under me, when I lead this country, the secretary of defense is going to have to make the choices, between how we keep, how we protect the survivability of our nuclear deployment on the Midgetman missile, or on the Minuteman, whatever it is.", "We're going to have to-the MX.", "We're going to have to do that.", "It's Christmas.", "(Laughter)", " Wouldn't it be nice to be perfect?", " I hope it isn't Christmas when you make that decision.", " wouldn't it be nice to be the ice man so you never make a mistake?", "These are the-my answer is do not make these unilateral cuts, and everybody now realizes that peace through strength works, and so this is where I have a big difference.", "Of course we're going to have to make some determination on this, and we're going to have to make it on the convention forces.", "But now we've got a very good concept called competitive strategies.", "We will do what we do best.", "It's a strategy that we've been working on for a couple of years.", "It is going to take us to much better advantage in conventional forces.", "But look, let me sum it up.", "I want to be the president that gets conventional forces balance.", "I want to be the one to banish chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth.", "But you have to have a little bit of experience to know where to start.", "And I think I've had that.", " Well, first let me say with respect to the freeze, that back in the spring of 1982 Mr. Bush was a lot more sympathetic to the freeze than he seems to be today.", "As a matter of fact, he said it was not and should not be subject to partisan demagoguery because it was too important for the United States or for the world.", "I didn't hear, John, exactly where he was going to cut and what he was going to do.", "But I know this, we have serious financial problems in this country.", "We've piled up over a trillion dollars in debt and the next president of the United States is going to have to make some choices.", "Mr. Bush wants to spend billions on Star Wars.", "He apparently wants to spend billions on the MX on railroad cars, a weapons system we don't need and can't afford.", "I thought the administration was opposed to the Midgetman.", "I thought the administration was at the negotiating table in Geneva suggesting that we ban mobile missile systems entirely.", "But those are the choices the next president of the United States is going to have to make.", "I'm for the Stealth, I'm for the D-5, I'm for going ahead with the advance Cruise missile.", "But I don't think we need these other systems.", "I don't think we need them to remain strong.", "We've got to move ahead with the strategic arms negotiation process, with the comprehensive test ban treaty and with negotiations leading to conventional force reduction in Europe with deeper cuts on the Soviet side and Senator Bentsen and I will pursue that policy.", " What I think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika and glasnost, welcome them, but keep our eyes open.", "Be cautious.", "Because the Soviet change is not fully established yet.", "Yes, I think it's fine to do business with them.", "And, so, I'm encouraged with what I see when I talk to Mr. -- what I hear when I talk to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze, but can they pull it off.", "And when they have a --they a --deals that are good for us, as China started to do--the changes in China since Barbara and I lived there is absolutely amazing, in terms of incentive, in partnership and things of this nature.", "And now the Soviet Union seems to be walking down that same path.", "We should encourage that.", "We ought to say this is good.", "But where I differ with my opponent is I am not going to make unilateral cuts in our strategic defend systems or support some freeze when they have superiority.", "I'm not going to do that, because I think the jury is still out on the Soviet experiment.", "And the interesting place-one of the things that fascinates me about this perestroika and glasnost is wheats going to happen in Eastern Europe.", "You see the turmoil in Poland today.", "And I think we have enormous opportunity for trade.", "I don't want to go back to the Carter grain embargo on the Soviets.", "We are once again reliable suppliers and I would never use food as a political tool like our predecessors did.", "But this is an exciting time.", "But all I'm suggesting is let's not be na\u00c3\u00afve in dealing with the Soviets and make a lot of unilateral cuts hoping against hope that they will match our bid.", "Look at the INF treaty.", "And if we haven't learned from the negotiating history on that, we'll never learn.", "The freeze people were wrong.", "The Reagan-Bush administration was right.", " It was a very different George Bush who was talking much more sympathetically about the freeze in the spring of 1982 than he is today.", "And you were right then, George, when you said it was no time for partisan demagoguery.", "Nobody is suggesting that we unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce our strength, of course not.", "What we're talking about is a combination of a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent.", "Strong, well-equipped, well-trained, well-maintained conventional forces.", "And at the same time a willingness to move forward steadily, thoughtfully cautiously.", "We have serious differences with the Soviet Union.", "We have very fundamental differences about human rights, democracy and our basic system, our basic view of human beings and of what life is all about.", "But there are opportunities there now.", "Senator Bentsen and I have a plan for the 1990\u00cf\u20acs and beyond.", "Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle do not.", "And we want to pursue that plan in a way which will bring down the level of nuclear armament, will build a more stable and more peaceful world while making choices here at home.", "Let's not forget that our national security and our economic security go hand in hand.", "We cannot be strong militarily when we're teeter-tottering on top of a mountain of debt which has been created in the past eight years.", "That's why we need a Democratic administration in Washington in 1989.", "(Applause)", " No, there's been no change of heart.", "I said from the beginning that we ought to continue research into the strategic system at about the level that was added in 1983, that's about a billion dollars a year.", "But I don't know of any reputable scientist who believed that this system, at least as originally conceived could possibly work, this notion of some kind of astrodome over ourselves that could protect us from enemy attack.", "It makes real sense.", "And as a matter of fact, the system that the administration is now talking about is very different from the one that was originally proposed in 1983.", "So, I'm for continued research, but I also want strong conventional forces.", "Now, the other day, Mr. Bush said, \u00e2\u2030\u00a5Well, if we continue with Star War-Star Wars-we have to cut some place.\u00e2\u2030\u00a4 He hasn't told us where.", "We know where they're cutting.", "We know where you're cutting right now.", "You're cutting into the fiber and muscle of our conventional forces.", "You're cutting back on maintenance and equipment.", "An Air Force General not too long ago in Europe who said that pretty soon we'd have airplanes without engines, tank commanders who can't drive their tanks more than three-quarters of a mile, because they don't have enough fuel.", "Coast Guard cutters tied up at the dock this summer, not patrolling.", "They're supposed to be our first line of defense against drugs and the war against drugs, because they don't have enough fuel.", "You have to make choices.", "We're not making those choices.", "And to spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr. Bush apparently wants to, although, he, himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately-on Star Wars-in my judgment makes no sense at all.", "We need a strong, credible, effective nuclear deterrent.", "We have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads right now on land, on sea and in the air, enough to blow up the Soviet Union forty times over.", "They have about 12,000.", "So, we've got to move forward with those negotiations, get the level of strategic weapons down.", "But to continue to commit billions to this system makes no sense at all and I think Mr. Bush has been reconsidering his position over the course of the past few weeks.", "That's-at least that's what I read.", "Maybe he'll tell us where he stand on it tonight.", " I'm not reconsidering my position.", " How do you deter nuclear attack without modernizing our nuclear forces when the Soviets are modernizing and how come you spend-willing to spend a dime on something that you consider a fantasy and a fraud.", "Those are two hypo-rhetorical questions.", "He is the man on conventional forces that wants to eliminate two carrier battle groups.", "The armed forces, the conventional forces of the United States have never been more ready.", "Every single one of the Joint Chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness is in an historic high.", "And secondly, in terms of the cutting of the Coast Guard, the Democratic controlled Congress, so please help us with that, who cut $70 million from the Coast Guard out of the interdiction effort on narcotics.", "(Applause)", " He's got to get this thing more clear.", "Why do you spend a billion dollars on something you think is a fantasy and a fraud?", "I will fully research it, go forward as fast as we can.", "We've set up the levels of funding and when it is deployable, I will deploy it.", "That is my position on SDI and it's never wavered a bit.", " Peter, it's one of the most agonizing decisions a president has to make.", "These are American citizens, we care deeply about them.", "Their families care deeply about them, want them back and understandably so and we want to do everything we can to bring them back.", "But if there's one thing we also understand it is that you cannot make concessions to terrorists, ever, ever.", "Because if you do, it's an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us.", "And that's the tragedy of the Iran/Contra scandal.", "As a matter of fact, Mr. Bush was the Chairman of a task force on international terrorism which issued a report shortly before that decision was made and said, and rightly so, that we never ever can make concessions to terrorists and hostage takers.", "And, yet, after sitting through meeting after meeting, he endorsed that decision, endorsed the sale of arms to the Ayatollah in exchange for hostages, one of the most tragic, one of the most mistaken foreign policy decisions we've ever made in this country and I dare say encouraged others to take hostages as we now know.", "So, there can be no concessions under any circumstances, because if we do it's an open invitation to others to do the same.", "We've got to be tough on international terrorism.", "We've got to treat it as international crime.", "We've got to attack at all points, we've go to use undercover operations.", "We have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camps, we have to work closely with our allies to make sure that they're working with us and we with them and we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of international terrorism.", "Yes, we should make every effort to try to help those hostages come home, but it can never be because we make concessions.", "That was a tragic mistake that we made, a mistake that Mr. Bush made and others made and it should never ever be made again.", " I wrote the anti-terrorist report for this government.", "It is the best anti-terrorist report written.", "Yes, we shouldn't trade arms for hostages.", "But we have made vast improvements in our anti-terrorism.", "Now, it's fine to say that sometimes you have to hit base camps, but when the president saw this state sponsored-fingerprints of Muammar Khadaffi on the loss of American life, he hit Libya.", "And my opponent was unwilling to support that action.", " That's not true.", "That's not true.", " And since that action, terrorist action against the United States citizens have gone down.", " That's not true.", " And I have long ago said I supported the president on this other matter.", "And I've said mistakes were made.", "Clearly nobody's going to think the president started out thinking he was going to trade arms for hostages.", "That is a very serious charge against the president.", "The matter has been thoroughly looked into.", "But the point is sometimes the action- (Laughter)", " - has to be taken by the Federal Government and when we took action, it had a favorable response.", " You're judged by the whole record.", "You're judged by the entire record.", "Are we closer to peace?", "Are we doing better in anti-terrorism?", "Should we have listened to my opponent who wanted to send the UN into the Persian Gulf or in spite of the mistakes of the past, are we doing better there?", "How is our credibility with the GCC countries on the Western side of the Gulf.", "Is Iran talking to Iraq about peace?", "You judge on the record.", "Are the Soviets coming out of Afghanistan?", "How does it look in a program he called or some one of these marvelous Boston adjective up there and-about Angola-now, we have a chance-several Bostonians don't like it, but the rest of the country will understand.", "(Applause)", " Now we have a chance.", "Now we have a chance.", "And, so, I think that I'd leave it right there and say that you judge on the whole record.", "And let me say this-all he can talk about-he goes around ranting about Noriega.", "Now, I've told you what the intelligence briefing he received said about that.", "He can talk about Iran/Contra and also-I'll make a deal with you, I will take the blame for those two incidents if you give me half the credit for all the good things that have happened in world peace since Ronald Reagan and I took over from the Carter administration.", "(Applause)", " I still have a couple of minutes left.", "And there is a difference principle -", " It's only on yellow here.", "Wait a minute.", "(Laughter)", " Jim -", " I said I wasn't perfect.", "Where was I?", " 25th of December, Mr. Vice President.", "(Laughter)", " I finished.", " He can have another ten seconds if he wants, Jim.", " Well, the matter of judgment is very

have a right to judge us on this question, on how we picked a running mate, a person who is a heartbeat away from the presidency.", "I picked Lloyd Bentsen, distinguished, strong, mature, a leader in the Senate, somebody whose qualifications nobody has questioned.", "Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle.", "I doubt very much that Dan Quayle was the best qualified person for that job.", "And as a matter of fact, I think for most people the notion of President Quayle is a very very troubling thought.", " I did indeed.", " Well, John, I'm a man that's been a chief executive for ten years.", "I've picked a

us to clean up our environment at the same time.", "Bio-degradable plastics-plastic-gasohol, which the Vice President has been involved in, road de-icers made from corn products.", "I mean, there are

of fact, Mexico, itself, is one of our biggest agricultural customers, so in the sense that we can work to help Mexico rebuild and expand and deal with these very serious economic problems we help our farmers at the same time.", " I oppose supply management and production controls.", "I support the farm bill, the 1985 farm bill and spending is moving in the right direction.", "I want to expand our

grain embargo on the farmers in this country.", "I want to see rural redevelopment and I have been out front in favor of alternate sources of energy and one of them is gasohol and comes from using your corn and I think we can do better in terms of biodegradable for a lot of product, so I'm optimistic about the agricultural economy.", "In terms of the Third World, I support the Baker plan.", "I want to see market economies spring up all around the world and to the degree they do, we are succeeding.", "And I don't want to see the banks let off the hook.", "I would oppose that, but I think were on the right track in agriculture and I am very very encouraged.", "But let's not go back to that-what they call supply management and production control, that'll simply price us out of the international market.", "Let's try to expand our markets abroad.", " I talked in New Orleans about a gentler and kinder nation and I have made specific proposals on education and the environment and

people.", " The most important distinction in this campaign is that I represent real hope for change, a departure from trickle-down economics, a departure from tax and spend economics, to invest in

tomorrow.", " Well, I think one thing that distinguishes is experience.", "I think we've dramatically changed the world.", "I'll talk about that a little bit later, but the changes are mind-boggling for world peace.", "Kids go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war.", "And change for change sake isn't enough.", "We saw that message in the late 70s when heard a lot about change, and what happened, that misery index went right through the roof.", "But my economic program is the kind of change we want.", "And the way we're going to get it done is we're going to have a brand new Congress.", "A lot of them are thrown out because of all the scandals.", "I'll sit down with them, Democrats and Republicans alike, and work for my agenda for American renewal, which represents real change.", "But I'd say, if you had to separate out, I think it's experience at this level.", " I believe experience counts, but it's not everything.", "Values, judgment, and the record that I have amassed in my state also should count for something.", "I've worked hard to create good jobs and to educate people.", "My state now ranks first in the country in job growth this year, fourth in income growth, fourth in reduction of poverty, third in overall economic performance, according to a major news magazine.", "That's because we believe in investing in education and in jobs.", "And we have to change in this country.", "You know, my wife, Hillary, gave me a book about a year ago in which the author defined insanity as just doing the same old thing over and over again and expecting a different result.", "We have got to have the courage to change.", "Experience is important, yes.", "I've gotten a lot of good experience in dealing with ordinary people over the last year and month.",

worked harder.", "In the last four years, there have been twice as many bankruptcies as new jobs created.", "We need a new approach.", "The same old experience is not relevant.", "We're living in a new world after the Cold War, and what works in this new world is not trickle down, not government for the benefit of the privileged few, not tax and spend, but a commitment to invest in American jobs

could win would be to convince everybody how horrible things are.", "Yes, there are big problems, and yes, people are hurting.", "But I believe that this Agenda for American renewal I have is the answer to do it, and I believe we can get it done now, whereas we didn't in the past, because you're going to have a whole brand new bunch of people in the Congress that are going to have to listen to

man.", " I think the American people should be the judge of that.", "I think character is a very important question.", "I said something the other day where I was accused of being like Joe McCarthy

demonstrations against it when young men are held prisoner in Hanoi or kids out of the ghetto were drafted.", "Some say, \"well, you're a little old fashioned.\"", "Maybe I am, but I just don't think that's right.", "Now, whether it's character or judgment -- whatever it is -- I have a big difference here on this issue and so we'll just have to see how it plays out.", "But I -- I couldn't do that.", "And I don't think most Americans could do that.", "And they all say, \"Well, it was a long time ago.\"", "Well, let's admit it then.", "Say, \"I made a terrible mistake.\"", "How could you be

go.", "The Commander-in-Chief was organizing demonstrations halfway around the world during another era.", "So there are differences but that's about the main area where I think we have a difference.", "I don't know about -- we'll talk about that a little with Ross here in a bit.", " I think the American people will make their own decisions on character and at a time when we have work to do and we need action I think they need to clearly understand the backgrounds of each person.", "I think the press can play a huge roll in making sure that the backgrounds are clearly presented in an objective way.", "Then, make a decision.", "Certainly anyone in the White House should have the character to be there.", "But, I think it's very important to measure when and where things occurred.", "Did they occur when you were a young person, in your formative years?", "Or did they occur while you were a senior official in the federal government?", "When you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a senior official in the federal government spending billions of dollars in taxpayer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a mature individual and you make a mistake, then that was on our ticket.", "If you make it as a young man, time passes.", "So I would say just, you know, look at all three of us.", "Decide who you think will do the job.", "Pick that person in November because believe me, as I've said before, \"The party's over and it's time for the clean-up crew.\"", "And we do have to have change and people who never take responsibility for anything when it happens on

Prize-winning economists and 500 others, including numerous Republican and Democratic business executives, have endorsed this approach because it offers the best hope to put America back to work and get our incomes rising instead of falling.", " Your question was on fairness.", "I just disagree with Mr. Perot.", "I don't believe it is fair to slap a 50-cent-a-gallon tax over whatever many years on the people that have to drive for a living, people that go long distances.", "I don't think we need to do it.", "You see, I have a fundamental difference.", "I agree with what he's talking about in trying to get this spending down and the discipline, although I think we ought to totally exempt Social Security.", "But he's talking tough medicine, and I think that's good.", "I disagree with the tax-and-spend philosophy.", "You see, I don't think we need to tax more and spend more, and then say that's going to make the problem better.", "And I'm afraid that's what I think I'm hearing from Governor Clinton.", "I believe what you need to do is some of what Ross is talking about: control the growth of mandatory spending and get taxes down.", "He's mentioned some ways to do it--and I agree with those.", "I've been talking about getting a capital gains cut forever, and his friends in Congress have been telling me that's a tax break for the rich.", "It would stimulate investment.", "I'm for an investment tax allowance; I'm for a tax break for first- time homebuyers.", "And with this new Congress coming in, gridlock will be gone, and I'll sit down with them and say let's get this done.", "But I do not want to go the tax-and-spend route.", " I assume she was supportive of the decision on McDonnell Douglas, I assume she was supporting me on the decision to sell those airplanes.", "I think it's a good decision--took a little heat for it, but I think it was the correct decision to do.", "And we worked it out, and indeed we're moving forward all around the world in a much more peaceful way.", "So that one we came away with in creating jobs for the American people.", "I would simply say to her, look, take a look at what the president has proposed on job retraining.", "When you cut back on defense spending, some people are going to be thrown out of work.", "If you throw another 50,000 kids on the street because of cutting recklessly in troop levels, you're going to put a lot more out of work.", "I would say to them, look at the job retraining programs that we're proposing.", "Therein is the best answer to her.", " stimulate investment and savings.", "I mean, we've got big economic problems, but we are not coming apart at the seams; we're ready for a recovery.", "With interest rates down and inflation down, the cruelest tax of all, caught up in a global slowdown right now, that that will change if you go with the programs I've talked about and if you help with job retraining and education.", "I am a firm believer that our America 2000 education problem is the answer--a little longer run; it's going to take awhile to educate.", "But it is a good program.", "So her best help for short term is job retraining, if she was thrown out of work at a defense plant.", "But tell her it's not all that gloomy; we're the US, we faced tough problems before.", "Look at the misery index when the Democrats had both the White House and the Congress.", "It was just right through the roof.", "Now, we can do better.", "And the way to do better is not to tax and spend but to retrain, get that control of the mandatory spending programs.", "I'm much more optimistic about this country than some.", "(APPLAUSE)", " Defense industries are going to have to convert to civilian industries.", "Many of them are.", "And the sooner they start, the sooner they'll finish.", "And there will be a significant transition.", "And it's very important that we not continue to let our industrial base deteriorate.", "We had someone who I'm sure regrets said it in the president's staff said he didn't care whether we made potato chips or computer chips.", "Well, anybody that thinks about it cares a great deal.", "Number one, you make more making computer chips than potato chips; and, number 2, 19 out of 20 computer chips that we have in this country now come from Japan.", "We've given away whole industries.", "So as we phase these industries over, there's a whole of intellectual talent in these industries.", "A lot of these people in industries can be converted to the industries of tomorrow, and that's where the high-paying jobs are.", "We need to have a very carefully thought through phase-over.", "Now, see, we practice 19th century capitalism.", "The rest of the world practices 21st century capitalism.", "I can't handle that in a minute, but I hope we can get back into it later.", "In the rest of the world, the countries and the businesses would be working together to make this transition in an intelligent way.", " We must have a transition plan to plan to convert from a defense to a domestic economy.", "No other nation would have cut defense as much as we already have without that.", "There are 200,000 people unemployed in California alone because we have cut defense without planning to retrain them and to reinvest in the technologies of the future here at home.", "That is what I want to do.", "This administration may say they have a plan, but the truth is they have not even released all the money, the paltry sum of money, that Congress appropriated.", "I want to take very dollar by which we reduce defense and reinvest it in technologies for the 21st century--in new transportation, in communication, in environmental clean-up technologies.", "Let's put the American people to work, and let's build the kind of high-tech, high-wage, high-growth economy that the American people deserve.", " Step one, the American people send me up there, the day after election, I'll get with congressional--we won't even wait till inauguration, and I'll ask the president to help me and I'll ask his staff to help me.", "And we will start putting together teams to put together--to take all the plans that exist and do something with them.", "Please understand.", "There are great plans lying all over Washington nobody ever executes.", "It's like having a blueprint for a house you never built.", "You don't have anywhere to sleep.", "Now our challenge is to take these things, do something with them.", "Step one, we want to put America back to work, clean up the small business problem, have one task force at work on that.", "The second, you've got your big companies that are in trouble, including the defense industries--have another one on that.", "Have a 3rd task force on new industries of the future to make sure we nail those for our country and they don't wind up in Europe and Asia.", "Convert from 19th to 21st century capitalism.", "See, we have an adversarial relationship between government and business.", "Our international competitors that are cleaning our plate have an intelligent relationship between government and business, and a supportive relationship.", "Then have another task force on crime because, next to jobs, our people are concerned about their safety.", "Health care, schools--one on the debt and deficit.", "And finally in that 90- day period before the inauguration, put together the framework for the town hall and give the American people a Christmas present.", "Show them by Christmas the first cut at these plans.", "By the time Congress comes into session to go to work, have those plans ready to go in front of Congress.", "Then get off to a flying start in '93 to execute these plans.", "Now, there are people in this room and people on this stage who've been in meetings when I would sit there and say, \"Is this the one we're going to talk about or do something about?\"", "Well, obviously, my orientation is let's go do it.", "Now, put together your plans by Christmas, be ready to go when Congress goes, nail these things.", "Small business--you've got to have capital, you've got to credit, and many of them need mentors or coaches.", "And we can create more jobs there in a hurry than any other place.", " This country desperately needs a jobs program, and my first priority would be to pass a jobs program, to introduce it on the first day I was inaugurated.", "I would meet with the leaders of the Congress, with all the newly elected members of the Congress and as many others with whom I could meet between the time of the election and the inauguration, and we would present a jobs program.", "Then we would present a plan to control health care costs and phase in health care coverage for all Americans.", "Until we control health care costs, we're not going to control the deficit.", "It is the number one culprit.", "But first we must have an aggressive jobs program.", "I live in a state where manufacturing job growth has far outpaced the nation in the last few years, where we have created more private sector jobs since Mr. Bush has been president than have been created in the entire rest of the country, where Mr. Bush's labor secretary said job growth has been enormous.", "We've done it in Arkansas.", "Give me a chance to create these kind of jobs in America.", "We can do it.", "I know we can.", "(APPLAUSE)", " We've got the plan announced for what we can do for small business.", "I've already put forward things that'll get this country working fast, some of which have been echoed here tonight--investment tax allowance, capital gains reduction, more on research and development, tax credit for first-time home buyers.", "What I'm going to do is say to Jim Baker when this campaign is over, all right, let's sit down now, you do in domestic affairs what you've done in foreign affairs, be kind of the economic coordinator of all the domestic side of the House, and that includes all the economic side, all the training side, and bring this program together.", "We're going to have a new Congress, and we're going to say to them, you've listened to the voters the way we have.", "Nobody wants gridlock anymore, and so let's get the program through.", "And I believe it'll work because, as Ross said, we got the plans.", "The plans are all over Washington.", "And I've put ours together in something called the Agenda for American Renewal, and it makes sense, it's sensible, it creates jobs, it gets to the base of the kind of jobs we need.", "And so I'll just be asking for support to get that put into effect.", " Well, let me say that I think that we might ought to review the terms, the way it works.", "But frankly, I don't think that's the problem today.", "We have low interest rates today.", "At least we have low interest rates that the Fed can control.", "Our long-term interest rates are still pretty high because of our deficit and because of our economic performance.", "And there was a terrible reaction internationally to Mr. Bush saying he was going to give us 4 more years of trickle-down economics--another across-the- board tax cut and most of it going to the wealthy, with no real guarantee of investment.", "But I think the important thing--the important thing-- is to use the powers the president does have on the assumption that, given the condition of this economy, we're going to keep interest rates down if we have the discipline to increase investment and reduce the debt at the same time.", "That is my commitment.", "I think the American people are ready for action.", "I think Congress is hungry for someone who will work with them instead of manipulate them.", "Someone who will not veto a bill that has an investment tax credit, middle class tax relief, research and development tax credits as Mr. Bush has done.", "Give me a chance to do that.", "I don't have to worry in the near term about the Federal Reserve.", "Their policies so far, it seems to me, are pretty sound.", " I don't think the Fed ought to be put under the Executive Branch.", "There is a separation there.", "I think that's fine.", "Alan Greenspan is respected.", "I've had some arguments with him about the speed in which we might have lowered interest rates, but Governor Clinton, he talks about the reaction to the markets.", "There was a momentary fear that he might win and that the markets went phwee, down like that.", "So I don't think we can judge on, the stock market has been strong.", "It's been very strong since I've been president.", "And they recognize we got great difficulties, but they're also much more optimistic than the pessimists we have up here tonight.", "In terms of vetoing tax bills, you're darn right.", "I am going to protect the American taxpayer against the spend and tax Congress.", "And I'm going to keep on vetoing them, because I don't think we're taxed too little.", "I think the government's spending too much.", "So Governor Clinton can label it tax for the rich or anything he wants.", "I'm going to protect the working man by continuing to veto, and to threaten to veto until we get this new Congress, and then we're going to move forward on our plan.", "I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to protect them.", " Keep the Federal Reserve independent, but let's live in a world of reality.", "We live in a global economy, not a national economy.", "These interest rates we have now don't make any sense.", "We have a four trillion dollar debt, and only in America would you finance seventy percent of it five years or less.", "So seventy percent of our debt is five years or less.", "It's very interest sensitive.", "We have a four percent gap between what we pay for treasuries, and what Germany pays for one to five year treasuries.", "That gap is going to close, because the Arabs, the Japanese and folks in this country are going to start buying German treasuries because they can get more money.", "Every time our interest rates go up one percent, that adds 28 billion dollars to the deficit or to the debt.", "Whichever place you put it.", "We are sitting on a ticking time bomb folks, because we have totally mismanaged our country, and we had better get it back under control.", "Just think in your own business, if you had all of your long term problems financed short term.", "You'd go broke in a hurry.", " Again, if you're not rich, you're not a superpower.", "So we have two that I'd put as number one.", "I have number 1 and 1A.", "One is we've got to have the money to be able to pay for defense, and we've got to manufacture here.", "Believe it or not folks, you can't ship it all overseas, you've got to make it here.", "And you can't convert from potato chips to airplanes in an emergency.", "See, Willow Run could be converted from cars to airplanes in World War II because it was here.", "We've got to make things here.", "You can't ship them overseas anymore.", "I hope we can talk more about that.", "Second thing, on priorities.", "We've got to help Russia succeed in its revolution and all of its republics.", "When we think of Russia, remember we're thinking of many countries, now.", "We've got to help them.", "That's pennies on the dollar compared to renewing the cold war.", "Third, we've got all kinds of agreements on paper, and some that are being executed on getting rid of nuclear warheads.", "Russia and its republics are out of control or at best in weak control right now.", "It's a very unstable situation.", "You've got every rich Middle Eastern country over there trying to buy nuclear weapons.", "As you well know.", "And that will lead to another five star migraine headache down the road.", "We really need to nail down the big intercontinental ballistic missiles, the ones that can hit us from Russia.", "And we've focused on the tactical.", "We've made real progress there.", "We've got some agreement on the nuclear, but we don't have those things put away yet.", "The sooner the better.", "So, in terms of priorities, we've got to be financially strong.", "Number two, we've got to take care of this missile situation and try to get the nuclear war behind us and give this thing very high priority.", "And number three, we need to help and support Russia and the republics in every possible way to become democratic capitalistic societies, and not just sit back and let those countries continue in turmoil.", "Because they could go back worse than things used to be.", "And believe me there are a lot of old boys in the K.G.B.", "and the military that liked it better the way it used to be.", " In order to keep America the strongest nation in the world, we need some continuity and some change.", "There are three fundamental challenges.", "First of all, the world is still a dangerous and uncertain place.", "We need a new military and a new national security policy equal to the challenges of a post cold war era, a smaller permanent military force, but one that is more mobile, well trained with high technology equipment.", "We need to continue the negotiations to reduce the nuclear arsenals in the Soviet Union, the former Soviet Union, and the United States.", "We need to stop this proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.", "Second, we have to face that in this world, economic security is a whole lot of national security.", "Our dollar's at an all time low against some foreign currencies.", "We're weak in the world.", "We must rebuild America's strength at home.", "And finally, we ought to be promoting the democratic impulses around the world.", "Democracies are our partners.", "They don't go to war with each other.", "They're reliable friends in the future.", "National security, economic strength, democracy.", " Well, we still are the envy of the world in terms of our military.", "There's no question about that.", "We're the envy of the world in terms of our economy, despite the difficulties we're having.", "There's no question about that.", "Our exports are dramatically up.", "I might say to Mr. Perot, I can understand why you might have missed it, because there's so much fascination with trivia, but I worked out a deal with Boris Yeltsin to eliminate, get rid of entirely, the most destabilizing weapons of all, the SS-18, the intercontinental ballistic missile.", "I mean, that's been done.", "And thank God, it has, because the parents of these young people around here go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war.", "We made dramatic progress.", "And so, we've got a good military.", "the question, to sort of get a new military, get the best in the world, we got it, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re keeping the peace, and they're respected around the world.", "And we're more respected because of the way we have conducted ourselves.", "We didn't listen to the nuclear freeze crowd.", "We said, \"Peace through strength,\" and it worked and the cold war is over.", "And America understands that.", "But we're so, turned so inward we don't understand the global picture.", "And we are helping democracy, Ross.", "The Freedom Support Act is something I got through the Congress, and it's a very good thing, because it does exactly what you say, and I think you agree with that, to help Russian democracy.", "And we're going to keep on doing that.", " I think our relationships with China are important and I don't want to isolate China, but I think it is a mistake for us to do what this Administration did when all those kids went out there carrying the Statue of Liberty in Tiananmen Square.", "Mr Bush sent two people in secret to toast the Chinese leaders and basically tell them not to worry about it.", "They rewarded him by opening negotiations with Iran to transfer nuclear technology.", "That was their response to that sort of action.", "Now that the voices in the Congress and throughout the country have insisted that we do something about China, look at what has happened.", "China has finally agreed to stop sending us products made with prison labor.", "Not because we coddled them, but because the Administration was pushed into doing something about it.", "And recently the Chinese have announced they are going to lower some barriers to our products, which they ought to do since they have a 15 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States under Mr. Bush.", "The second biggest surplus next to Japan.", "So I would be firm.", "I would say if you want to continue as Most Favored Nation status for your government owned industries as well as your private ones, observe human rights in the future.", "Open your society.", "Recognize the legitimacy of those kids that were carrying the Statue of Liberty.", "If we can stand up for our economics, we ought to be able to preserve the democratic interests of the people of China.", "And over the long run they will be more reliable partners.", " Well, the Administration was the first major country to stand up to the abuse in Tiananmen Square.", "We are the one that worked out the prison labor deal.", "We are the ones that lowered the barrier to products with Carla Hill's negotiation.", "I am the one that said let's keep the M.F.N.", "because you see China moving towards a free market economy.", "To do what the Congress and Governor Clinton is suggesting, you'd isolate and ruin Hong Kong.", "They are making some progress, not enough for us.", "We were the first ones to put sanctions on.", "We still have them on, on some things.", "But Governor Clinton's philosophy is isolate them.", "He says don't do it, but the policies he's expounding of putting conditions on M.F.N.", "and kind of humiliating them is not the way you make the kind of progress we are getting.", "And I've stood up with these people, and I understand what you have to do to be strong in this situation, and it's moving, not as fast as we'd like.", "But you isolate China and turn them inward, and then we've made a tremendous mistake.", "And I'm not going to do it.", "And I've had to fight a lot of people that were saying human rights, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the ones that put the sanctions on and stood for it.", "And he can insult General Scowcroft if he wants to.", "They didn't go over to coddle.", "He went over to say we must make the very changes they're making now.", " All right, it's huge.", "China, is a huge country, broken into many provinces.", "It has some very elderly leaders that will not be around too much longer.", "Capitalism is growing and thriving across big portions of China.", "Asia will be our largest trading partner in the future.", "It will be a growing and a closer relationship.", "We have a delicate, tight-wire walk that we must go through at the present time to make sure that we do not cozy up to tyrants, to make sure that they don't get the impression that they can suppress their people.", "But time is our friend there, because their leaders will change in not too many years, worst case, and their country is making great progress.", "One last point on the missiles.", "I don't want the American people to be confused.", "We have written agreements and we have some missiles that have been destroyed, but we have a huge number of intercontinental ballistic missiles that are still in place in Russia.", "The fact that you have an agreement is one thing.", "Till they're destroyed, some crazy person can either sell them or use them.", " Ann, both of them are very complicated situations.", "And I vowed something because I learned something from Vietnam.", "I am not going to commit US forces until I know what the mission is, till the military tell me that it can be completed, and till I know how they can come out.", "We are helping.", "American airplanes are helping today on humanitarian relief for Sarajevo.", "It is America that's in the lead in helping with humanitarian relief for Somalia.", "But when you go to put somebody else's son or daughter into war, I think you got to be a little bit careful and you have to be sure that there's a military plan that can do this.", "You have ancient ethnic rivalries that have cropped up as Yugoslavia's dissolved or getting dissolved, and it isn't going to be solved by sending in the 82nd Airborne, and I'm not going to do that as commander-in-chief.", "I am going to stand by and use the moral persuasion of the US to get satisfaction in terms of prison camps, and we're making some progress there, and in terms of getting humanitarian relief in there.", "And right now, as you know, the US took the lead in a no-fly operation up there in-- no- fly order up in the United Nations.", "We're working through the international organizations.", "That's one thing I learned by forging that tremendous and greatly--highly successful coalition against Saddam Hussein, the dictator.", "Use--work internationally to do it.", "I am very concerned about it.", "I am concerned about ethnic cleansing.", "I am concerned about a tax on Muslims, for example, over there.", "But I must stop short of using American force until I know how those young men and women are going to get out of there as well as get in, know what the mission is, and define it.", "And I think I'm on the right track.", " I think if we learned anything in Vietnam is you first commit this nation before you commit the troops to the battlefield.", "We cannot send our people all over the world to solve every problem that comes up.", "This is basically a problem that is a primary concern to the European Community.", "Certainly we care about the people, we care about the children, we care about the tragedy.", "But it is inappropriate for us, just because there's a problem somewhere around the world, to take the sons and daughters of working people--and make no mistake about it, our all- volunteer armed force is not made up of the sons and daughters of the beautiful people; it's the working folks who send their sons and daughters to war, with a few exceptions.", "It's very unlike World War II, when FDR's sons flew missions.", "Everybody went.", "It's a different world now.", "It's very important that we not just, without thinking it through, just rush to every problem in the world and have our people torn to pieces.", "  I agree that we cannot commit ground forces to become involved in the quagmire of Bosnia or in the tribal wars of Somalia.", "But I think that it's important to recognize that there are things that can be done short of that, and that we do have interests there.", "There are, after all, 2 million refugees now because of the problems in what was Yugoslavia, the largest number since World War II, and there may be hundreds of thousands of people who will starve or freeze to death in this winter.", "The US should try to work with its allies and stop it.", "I urged the president to support this air cover, and he did--and I applaud that.", "I applaud the no-fly zone, and I know that he's going back to the United Nations to try to get authority to enforce it.", "I think we should stiffen the embargo on the Belgrade government, and I think we have to consider whether or not we should lift the arms embargo now on the Bosnians, since they are in no way in a fair fight with a heavily armed opponent bent on ethnic cleansing.", "We can't get involved in the quagmire, but we must do what we can.", " Well, thank you very much, Jim, for this opportunity.", "I want to thank Governor Romney and the University of Denver for your hospitality.", "There are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me.", "And so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people.", "(LAUGHTER)  You know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.", "Millions of jobs were lost, the auto industry was on the brink of collapse.", "The financial system had frozen up.", "And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, we've begun to fight our way back.", "Over the last 30 months, we've seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created.", "The auto industry has come roaring back.", "And housing has begun to rise.", "But we all know that we've still got a lot of work to do.", "And so the question here tonight is not where we've been, but where we're going.", "Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that we'll be better off.", "I've got a different view.", "I think we've got to invest in education and training.", "I think it's important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that we're helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States, that we take some of the money that we're saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments.", "Now, it ultimately is going to be up to the voters -- to you -- which path we should take.", "Are we going to double on top-down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best?", "And I'm looking forward to having that debate.", " Thank you, Jim.", "It's an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the chance to be with the president.", "I'm pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates.", "And congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary.", "I'm sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine, here -- here with me.", "So I...  (LAUGHTER)  Congratulations.", "This is obviously a very tender topic.", "I've had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country.", "I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm and she said, \"I've been out of work since May.", "Can you help me?\"", "Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, \"Ann, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs.", "He's lost his most recent job and we've now just lost our home.", "Can you help us?\"", "And the answer is, yes, we can help, but it's going to take a different path.", "Not the one we've been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich.", "That's not what I'm going to do.", "My plan has five basic parts.", "One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent.", "That creates about 4 million jobs.", "Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America.", "Crack down on China, if and when they cheat.", "Number three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world.", "We're far away from that now.", "Number four, get to us a balanced budget.", "Number five, champion small business.", "It's small business that creates the jobs in America, and over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30-year low.", " Now, I'm concerned that the path that we're on has just been unsuccessful.", "The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more -- if you will, trickle-down government -- would work.", "That's not the right answer for America.", "I'll restore the vitality that gets America working again.", "Thank you.", " Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do.", "First, we've got to improve our education system and we've made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools.", "We've got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers.", "So now I want to hire another 100,000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now.", "And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.", "When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent.", "But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas.", "I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.", "On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we've got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than they've been in years.", "But I also believe that we've got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments.", " So all of this is possible.", "Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things I'm sure we'll be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code?", "And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments?", "And this is where there's a difference, because Governor Romney's central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut -- on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts -- that's another trillion dollars -- and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn't asked for.", "That's $8 trillion.", "How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign.", " Well, sure.", "I'd like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece.", "First of all, I don't have a $5 trillion tax cut.", "I don't have a tax cut of a scale that you're talking about.", "My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class.", "But I'm not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people.", "High-income people are doing just fine in this economy.", "They'll do fine whether you're president or I am.", "The people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans.", "Under the president's policies, middle-income Americans have been buried.", "They're just being crushed.", "Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300.", "This is a -- this is a tax in and of itself.", "I'll call it the economy tax.", "It's been crushing.", "At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president.", "Electric rates are up.", "Food prices are up.", "Health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family.", "Middle-income families are being crushed.", " And so the question is how to get them going again.", "And I've described it.", "It's energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business.", "Those are the -- the cornerstones of my plan.", "But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I'll just note.", "First, education.", " Education is key, particularly the future of our economy.", "But our training programs right now, we've got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies.", "Overhead is overwhelming.", "We've got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them.", "The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down.", "And I do, both for corporations and for individuals.", "But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth.", "The third area, energy.", "Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up.", "But not due to his policies.", "In spite of his policies.", "Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land.", "On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half.", "If I'm president, I'll double them, and also get the -- the oil from offshore and Alaska.", "And I'll bring that pipeline in from Canada.", "And, by the way, I like coal.", "I'm going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal.", "People in the coal industry feel like it's getting crushed by your policies.", "I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs.", "And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, I'm not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the -- the revenues going to the government.", "My -- my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit.", "I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit.", "But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans.", "And I -- and to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans.", "So any -- any language to the contrary is simply not accurate.", " Mr. President?", " Well, I think -- let's talk about taxes, because I think it's instructive.", "Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families.", "And that's exactly what I did.", "We cut taxes for middle-class families by about $3,600.", "And the reason is, because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well.", "And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car.", "They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through.", "They can buy a computer for their kid who's going off to college, which means they're spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers.", "Now, Governor Romney's proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military.", "And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions.", "The problem is that he's been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasn't been able to identify them.", "But I'm going to make an important point here, Jim.", " When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper-income individuals can -- are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you don't come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending.", " And that's why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romney's pledge of not reducing the deficit or -- or -- or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle-class families.", "The average middle-class family with children would pay about $2,000 more.", "Now, that's not my analysis.", "That's the analysis of economists who have looked at this.", "And -- and that kind of top -- top-down economics, where folks at the top are doing well, so the average person making $3 million is getting a $250,000 tax break, while middle-class families are burdened further, that's not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth.", " Well, but -- but virtually -- virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate.", " So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I'd say absolutely not.", "I'm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut.", "What I've said is I won't put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit.", "That's part one.", "So there's no economist that can say Mitt Romney's tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.", "Number two, I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals.", "I know that you and your running mate keep saying that and I know it's a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but it's just not the case.", "Look, I've got five boys.", "I'm used to people saying something that's not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I'll believe it.", "But that -- that is not the case.", "All right?", "I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans.", "And number three, I will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middle-income families.", "I will lower taxes on middle-income families.", "Now, you cite a study.", "There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it's completely wrong.", "I saw a study that came out today that said you're going to raise taxes by $3,000 to $4,000 on middle-income families.", "There are all these studies out there.", "But let's get at the bottom line.", "That is, I want to bring down rates.", "I want to bring the rates down, at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need.", "And you'd think, well, then why lower the rates?", " And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate.", "And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people.", "For me, this is about jobs.", "This is about getting jobs for the American people.", "(CROSSTALK)", " Well, for 18 months he's been running on this tax plan.", "And now, five weeks before the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is, \"Never mind.\"", "And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class.", "It's -- it's math.", "It's arithmetic.", "Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth.", "So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times.", "And what I want to do is continue the tax rates -- the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families.", "But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot.", "And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we're also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.", " And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business.", "Under -- under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up.", "Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they're the job creators, they'd be burdened.", "But under Governor Romney's definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses.", "Donald Trump is a small business.", "Now, I know Donald Trump doesn't like to think of himself as small anything, but -- but that's how you define small businesses if you're getting business income.", "And that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow.", "And I think that would be a mistake.", " Jim, let me just come back on that -- on that point, which is these...", " ... the small businesses we're talking about...", " It's fun, isn't it?", " You bet.", "Well, President, you're -- Mr. President, you're absolutely right, which is that, with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not -- not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate, they're taxed at a lower rate.", "But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half -- half of all the people who work in small business.", "Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America.", "And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent.", "Now, and -- and I've talked to a guy who has a very small business.", "He's in the electronics business in -- in St. Louis.", "He has four employees.", "He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes, federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax.", "It added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned.", "And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent.", "The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs.", "I don't want to cost jobs.", "My priority is jobs.", "And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions, the same idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the way, get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions, to create more jobs, because there's nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes.", "That's by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.", " Jim, I -- you may want to move onto another topic, but I -- I would just say this to the American people.", "If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for, $7 trillion -- just to give you a sense, over 10 years, that's more than our entire defense budget -- and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then Governor Romney's plan may work for you.", "But I think math, common sense, and our history shows us that's not a recipe for job growth.", "Look, we've tried this.", "We've tried both approaches.", "The approach that Governor Romney's talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.", " Bill Clinton tried the approach that I'm talking about.", "We created 23 million new jobs.", "We went from deficit to surplus.", "And businesses did very well.", "So, in some ways, we've got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans and I believe that the economy works best when middle-class families are getting tax breaks so that they've got some money in their pockets, and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure we're not blowing up the deficit.", " Jim, the president began this segment, so I think I get the last word.", "(CROSSTALK)", " All right.", "Well, but he gets the first word of that segment.", "I get the last word (inaudible) I hope.", "Let me just make this comment.", "(CROSSTALK)", " I think first of all, let me -- let me repeat -- let me repeat what I said.", "I'm not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut.", "That's not my plan.", "My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit.", "That's point one.", "So you may keep referring to it as a $5 trillion tax cut, but that's not my plan.", "Number two, let's look at history.", "My plan is not like anything that's been tried before.", "My plan is to bring down rates, but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working.", "My priority is putting people back to work in America.", "They're suffering in this country.", "And we talk about evidence.", "Look at the evidence of the last four years.", "It's absolutely extraordinary.", "We've got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country.", "It's just -- it's -- we've got -- when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before.", "Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.", " Good.", "I'm glad you raised that, and it's a -- it's a critical issue.", "I think it's not just an economic issue, I think it's a moral issue.", "I think it's, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and they're going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives.", "And the amount of debt we're adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral.", "So how do we deal with it?", "Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit.", "One, of course, is to raise taxes.", "Number two is to cut spending.", "And number is to grow the economy, because if more people work in a growing economy, they're paying taxes, and you can get the job done that way.", "The presidents would -- president would prefer raising taxes.", "I understand.", "The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth.", "And you could never quite get the job done.", "I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.", "What things would I cut from spending?", "Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they don't pass it: Is the program so critical it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it?", "And if not, I'll get rid of it.", "Obamacare's on my list.", "I apologize, Mr. President.", "I use that term with all respect, by the way.", " I like it.", " Good.", "OK, good.", "So I'll get rid of that.", "I'm sorry, Jim, I'm going to stop the subsidy to PBS.", "I'm going to stop other things.", "I like PBS, I love Big Bird.", "Actually like you, too.", "But I'm not going to -- I'm not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for.", "That's number one.", "Number two, I'll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state.", " Number three, I'll make government more efficient and to cut back the number of employees, combine some agencies and departments.", "My cutbacks will be done through attrition, by the way.", "This is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget.", "The president said he'd cut the deficit in half.", "Unfortunately, he doubled it.", "Trillion-dollar deficits for the last four years.", "The president's put it in place as much public debt -- almost as much debt held by the public as al prior presidents combined.", " When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me.", "And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis.", "And despite that, what we've said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn't slip into a Great Depression, but what we've also said is, let's make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow.", "So 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but weren't working very well, 18 government -- 18 government programs for education that were well-intentioned, not weren't helping kids learn, we went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars, $50 billion of waste taken out of the system.", "And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget.", "That's the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower.", "Now, we all know that we've got to do more.", "And so I've put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan.", "It's on a website.", "You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise.", "And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit.", "Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission.", "Well, that's how the commission -- bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts.", "And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have.", "Let -- let me just finish their point, because you're looking for contrast.", "You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue?", "And he said no.", "Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education.", "It means that Governor Romney...  (CROSSTALK)", " ... talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities.", " And -- and that is not a right strategy for us to move forward.", " Sorry.", " Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that.", " I have my own plan.", "It's not the same as Simpson- Bowles.", "But in my view, the president should have grabbed it.", "If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress, fight for it.", " That's what we've done, made some adjustments to it, and we're putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan...", " But you've been -- but you've been president four years... (CROSSTALK)", " You've been president four years.", "You said you'd cut the deficit in half.", "It's now four years later.", "We still have trillion-dollar deficits.", "The CBO says we'll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next four years.", "If you're re-elected, we'll get to a trillion-dollar debt.", " I mean, you have said before you'd cut the deficit in half.", "And this -- I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts.", "You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year.", "That doesn't get the job done.", "Let me come back and say, why is it that I don't want to raise taxes?", "Why don't I want to raise taxes on people?", "And actually, you said it back in 2010.", "You said, \"Look, I'm going to extend the tax policies that we have now; I'm not going to raise taxes on anyone, because when the economy is growing slow like this, when we're in recession, you shouldn't raise taxes on anyone.\"", "Well, the economy is still growing slow.", "As a matter of fact, it's growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement.", "And so if you believe the same thing, you just don't want to raise taxes on people.", "And the reality is it's not just wealthy people -- you mentioned Donald Trump.", "It's not just Donald Trump you're taxing.", "It's all those businesses that employ one-quarter of the workers in America; these small businesses that are taxed as individuals.", "You raise taxes and you kill jobs.", "That's why the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs.", "I don't want to kill jobs in this environment.", "I'll make one more point.", "(CROSSTALK)", " OK.", " Well, we've had this discussion before.", " There has to be revenue in addition to cuts.", "Now, Governor Romney has ruled out revenue.", "He's ruled out revenue.", "(CROSSTALK)", " Absolutely.", "(CROSSTALK)", " Look, the revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more taxes.", "That's how we get growth and how we balance the budget.", "But the idea of taxing people more, putting more people out of work, you'll never get there.", "You'll never balance the budget by raising taxes.", "Spain -- Spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government.", "We're now spending 42 percent of our economy on government.", "I don't want to go down the path to Spain.", "I want to go down the path of growth that puts Americans to work with more money coming in because they're working.", " If -- if we're serious, we've got to take a balanced, responsible approach.", "And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes.", "Let's talk about corporate taxes.", "Now, I've identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually help the economy.", "The oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare.", "Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don't get.", "Now, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money, when they're making money every time you go to the pump?", "Why wouldn't we want to eliminate that?", "Why wouldn't we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets?", "My attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it.", "When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue neutral way, close loopholes, deductions -- he hasn't identified which ones they are -- but that thereby bring down the corporate rate.", "Well, I want to do the same thing, but I've actually identified how we can do that.", "And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas.", "Right now, you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas.", "I think most Americans would say that doesn't make sense.", "And all that raises revenue.", "And so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college.", " It means that the teacher that I met in Las Vegas, a wonderful young lady, who describes to me -- she's got 42 kids in her class.", "The first two weeks she's got them, some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned.", "They're using text books that are 10 years old.", "That is not a recipe for growth.", "That's not how America was built.", "And so budgets reflect choices.", "Ultimately, we're going to have to make some decisions.", "And if we're asking for no revenue, then that means that we've got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff.", "And the magnitude of the tax cuts that you're talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow.", "As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we're talking about potentially a 30 -- a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time.", "Now, you know, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is, you know, numbers on a sheet of paper, but if we're talking about a family who's got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid, that's a big problem.", "And governors are creative.", "There's no doubt about it.", "But they're not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid.", "What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help.", " Jim, let's -- we've gone on a lot of topics there, and so it's going to take a minute to go from Medicaid to schools...", " ... to oil, to tax breaks, then companies going overseas.", "So let's go through them one by one.", "First of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year.", "And it's actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that's been in place for a hundred years.", "Now...", " It's time to end it.", " And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world.", "Now, I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas receives.", "And you say Exxon and Mobil.", "Actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth.", " But, you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table.", "Of course it's on the table.", "That's probably not going to survive you get that rate down to 25 percent.", "But don't forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years' worth of breaks, into -- into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1.", "I mean, I had a friend who said you don't just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right?", "So this -- this is not -- this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy secure.", "The second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas.", "Look, I've been in business for 25 years.", "I have no idea what you're talking about.", "I maybe need to get a new accountant.", " But -- but the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case.", "(CROSSTALK)", " What we do have right now is a setting where I'd like to bring money from overseas back to this country.", "And, finally, Medicaid to states?", "I'm not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you're going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you're going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best.", "And I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors -- Republican and Democrats -- said, please let us do that.", "We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor.", "So -- so let's state -- one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy.", "Don't have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have.", "Let states do this.", "And, by the way, if a state gets in trouble, well, we can step in and see if we can find a way to help them.", " But -- but the right -- the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and states, not the federal government.", " OK.", " You know, I suspect that, on Social Security, we've got a somewhat similar position.", "Social Security is structurally sound.", "It's going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker -- Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill.", "But it is -- the basic structure is sound.", "But -- but I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare, and then talk about Medicare, because that's the big driver of our deficits right now.", "You know, my grandmother -- some of you know -- helped to raise me.", "My grandparents did.", "My grandfather died a while back.", "My grandmother died three days before I was elected president.", "And she was fiercely independent.", "She worked her way up, only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank.", "And she ended up living alone by choice.", "And the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare.", "She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go.", "And that's the perspective I bring when I think about what's called entitlements.", "You know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks.", "These are folks who've worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this.", " So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term?", "And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if we're going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, let's look where some of the money's going.", "$716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we weren't overpaying providers.", "And using that money, we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600, and we were also able to make a -- make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the -- throughout the system.", "So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs.", "When it comes to Social Security, as I said, you don't need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future.", " Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and I know anytime we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that something's going to happen that's going to change their life for the worse.", "And the answer is neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare.", "So if you're 60 or around 60 or older, you don't need to listen any further.", "But for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring.", "Oh, I just thought about one.", "And that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the president isn't proposing any changes for current retirees.", "In fact he is on Medicare.", "On Social Security he's not.", "But on Medicare, for current retirees, he's cutting $716 billion from the program.", "Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers.", "Actually just going to them and saying, \"We're going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody's going to get a lower rate.\"", "That's not just going after places where there's abuse.", "That's saying we're cutting the rates.", "Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won't take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario.", "We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won't take more Medicare patients.", "This -- we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts.", "I can't understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare.", "Now, you point out, well, we're putting some back.", "We're going to give a better prescription program.", "That's $1 -- that's $1 for every $15 you've cut.", "They're smart enough to know that's not a good trade.", "I want to take that $716 billion you've cut and put it back into Medicare.", "By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it.", "But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake.", "And with regards to young people coming along, I've got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question.", " First of all, I think it's important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future.", "And the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program.", "It's called premium support, but it's understood to be a voucher program.", "His running mate...", " I don't.", "And let me explain why.", " Again, that's for future...", " I understand.", " ... people, right, not for current retirees.", " For -- so if you're -- if you're 54 or 55, you might want to listen 'cause this -- this will affect you.", "The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance.", "The problem is that because the voucher wouldn't necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year.", "Now, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is he'll maintain traditional Medicare alongside it.", "But there's still a problem, because what happens is, those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors.", "They recruit them, leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare.", "And every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, what'll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse.", " And then what you've got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care.", "So, I don't think vouchers are the right way to go.", "And this is not my own -- only my opinion.", "AARP thinks that the -- the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years.", "Benefits were not affected at all.", "And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I have become fond of this term, \"Obamacare,\" if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care.", "They're now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier.", "And the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they aren't making seniors any healthier.", "And I don't think that's the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term.", " What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare.", "And the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program.", " So that's -- that's number one.", "Number two is for people coming along that are young, what I do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan.", "Their choice.", "They get to choose -- and they'll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them.", "So they don't have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000.", "That's not going to happen.", "They'll have at least two plans.", " And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or they'll be able to get a private plan.", "I know my own view is I'd rather have a private plan.", "I'd just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get.", "I'd rather be able to have an insurance company.", "If I don't like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company.", "But people make their own choice.", "The other thing we have to do to save Medicare?", "We have to have the benefits high for those that are low income, but for higher income people, we're going to have to lower some of the benefits.", "We have to make sure this program is there for the long term.", "That's the plan that I've put forward.", "And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or -- or Senator Wyden, who's the co-author of the bill with -- with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill -- Bill Clinton's chief of staff.", "This is an idea that's been around a long time, which is saying, hey, let's see if we can't get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality.", "I believe in competition.", " Jim, if I -- if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it.", "And private insurers have to make a profit.", "Nothing wrong with that.", "That's what they do.", "And so you've got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that.", "And if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney's proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere.", "And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies.", "And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they're stuck.", "And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially.", "And that's why they were supportive of the approach that we took.", "One last point I want to make.", "We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare and Medicaid... LEHRER: Talk about that in a minute.", " ... but -- but -- but overall.", " And so...", " That's -- that's a big topic.", "Can we -- can we stay on Medicare?", " Is that a -- is that a separate topic?", "(CROSSTALK)", " I'm sorry.", " Let's get back to Medicare.", " Let's get back to Medicare.", "(CROSSTALK)", " The president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit.", " If that's the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase.", " But my experience -- my experience the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost.", " Absolutely.", " Absolutely.", " Absolutely.", " Regulation is essential.", "You can't have a free market work if you don't have regulation.", "As a businessperson, I had to have -- I need to know the regulations.", "I needed them there.", "You couldn't have people opening up banks in their -- in their garage and making loans.", "I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work.", "Every free economy has good regulation.", "At the same time, regulation can become excessive.", " In some places, yes.", "Other places, no.", " No, it can become out of date.", "And what's happened with some of the legislation that's been passed during the president's term, you've seen regulation become excessive, and it's hurt -- it's hurt the economy.", "Let me give you an example.", "Dodd-Frank was passed.", "And it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy.", "One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and they're effectively guaranteed by the federal government.", "This is the biggest kiss that's been given to -- to New York banks I've ever seen.", "This is an enormous boon for them.", "There've been 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd- Frank.", "So there's one example.", "Here's another.", "In Dodd-Frank...", " Well, I would repeal and replace it.", "We're not going to get rid of all regulation.", "You have to have regulation.", "And there are some parts of Dodd-Frank that make all the sense in the world.", "You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits for...", " But let's -- let's mention -- let me mention the other one.", "Let's talk... (CROSSTALK)", " I think this is a great example.", "The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board.", "Now, it wasn't just on Wall Street.", "You had loan officers were -- that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn't have been given, because the folks didn't qualify.", "You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn't afford.", "You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A1 great investments when they weren't.", "But you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didn't even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable.", "So what did we do?", "We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s.", "We said you've got -- banks, you've got to raise your capital requirements.", "You can't engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk.", "We've going to make sure that you've got to have a living will so -- so we can know how you're going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don't have other taxpayer bailouts.", " In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime, with interest.", "Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank.", "And, you know, I appreciate and it appears we've got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation.", "But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back.", "And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street?", "Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate.", "But that's not what I believe.", " Sorry, but that's just not -- that's just not the facts.", "Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street.", "That's why I'd have regulation.", "But I wouldn't designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check.", "That's one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank.", "It wasn't thought through properly.", "We need to get rid of that provision because it's killing regional and small banks.", "They're getting hurt.", "Let me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank.", "You say we were giving mortgages to people who weren't qualified.", "That's exactly right.", "It's one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had.", "And so Dodd-Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that's not qualified, there are big penalties, except they didn't ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was.", "It's been two years.", "We don't know what a qualified mortgage is yet.", "So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages.", "Try and get a mortgage these days.", "It's hurt the housing market because Dodd-Frank didn't anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have.", "It's not that Dodd-Frank always was wrong with too much regulation.", "Sometimes they didn't come out with a clear regulation.", "I will make sure we don't hurt the functioning of our -- of our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs.", " I sure do.", "Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience.", "You know, I was in New Hampshire.", "A woman came to me and she said, look, I can't afford insurance for myself or my son.", "I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we're thinking of dropping our insurance, we can't afford it.", "And the number of small businesses I've gone to that are saying they're dropping insurance because they can't afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive.", "And -- and we've got to deal with cost.", "And, unfortunately, when -- when -- when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance.", "So it's adding to cost.", "And as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500 a family.", "Instead, it's gone up by that amount.", "So it's expensive.", "Expensive things hurt families.", "So that's one reason I don't want it.", "Second reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it.", "I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors.", "Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that's going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have.", "I don't like that idea.", "Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country, said, what's been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans?", "And three-quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people.", "I just don't know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the -- at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people.", "It has killed jobs.", "And the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state.", "And then let's focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium.", " Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about.", "And it wasn't just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn't get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees.", "It wasn't just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country.", "If they had a pre-existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all.", "If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit.", "And so as a consequence, they're paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they don't have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance companies say that they've hit the limit.", "So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle-class families are secure in this country.", "And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did.", "Number one, if you've got health insurance, it doesn't mean a government takeover.", "You keep your own insurance.", "You keep your own doctor.", "But it does say insurance companies can't jerk you around.", "They can't impose arbitrary lifetime limits.", "They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance -- your insurance plan until you're 26 years old.", "And it also says that you're going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care.", "Number two, if you don't have health insurance, we're essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if you're out there trying to get insurance on the individual market.", "Now, the last point I'd make before...", " No, I think -- I had five seconds before you interrupted me, was ... (LAUGHTER)  ... the irony is that we've seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there.", "It hasn't destroyed jobs.", "And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold.", " Well, I did with my first statement.", "(CROSSTALK)", " First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts.", "I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together.", "What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote.", "As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary -- elected a Republican senator to stop Obamacare, you pushed it through anyway.", "So entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer and drove it through.", "What we did in a legislature 87 percent Democrat, we worked together; 200 legislators in my legislature, only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished.", "What were some differences?", "We didn't raise taxes.", "You've raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare.", "We didn't cut Medicare.", "Of course, we don't have Medicare, but we didn't cut Medicare by $716 billion.", " We didn't put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they're going to receive.", "We didn't also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put -- put people in a position where they're going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted.", "Right now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year.", "And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage.", "So for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance, this is why the American people don't want Medicare -- don't want Obamacare.", "It's why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had -- had the plan.", "They put a plan out.", "They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan.", "It was swept aside.", "I think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis.", "And we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties.", " Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis.", "This was a bipartisan idea.", "In fact, it was a Republican idea.", "And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.", "And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it's the same plan.", "It -- when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we've created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall?", "Because there -- there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis.", "One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that's been the trend line.", "Or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective?", "And there are ways of doing it.", "So at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average.", "And the reason they do is because they do some smart things.", "They -- they say, if a patient's coming in, let's get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests.", "Let's make sure that we're providing preventive care so we're catching the onset of something like diabetes.", "Let's -- let's pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they've -- they've engaged in.", "Now, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let's use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do.", "And the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we're going to be in a position to show that costs are going down.", "And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up -- it's true -- but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years.", "So we're already beginning to see progress.", "In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you're already getting a rebate.", "Let me make one last point.", "Governor Romney says, we should replace it, I'm just going to repeal it, but -- but we can replace it with something.", "But the problem is, he hasn't described what exactly we'd replace it with, other than saying we're going to leave it to the states.", " But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he's offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there's no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who's got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance.", "In fact, it's estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you're looking at 50 million people losing health insurance...", " ... at a time when it's vitally important.", " Well...", " Well, actually it's -- it's -- it's a lengthy description.", "But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan.", "Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan.", "That's already offered in the private marketplace.", "You don't have to have the government mandate that for that to occur.", "But let's come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it's more affordable for families.", "And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have.", "(CROSSTALK)", " In my opinion, the government is not effective in -- in bringing down the cost of almost anything.", "As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be.", "Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe.", "This is the private market.", "These are small -- these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs.", "I used to consult to businesses -- excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers.", "I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people.", "In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have.", "We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that's happening.", "Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others.", " But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have.", "That's the wrong way to go.", "The private market and individual responsibility always work best.", " Let me just point out first of all this board that we're talking about can't make decisions about what treatments are given.", "That's explicitly prohibited in the law.", "But let's go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions.", "Well, actually Governor, that isn't what your plan does.", "What your plan does is to duplicate what's already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can't deny you if you've -- if it's been under 90 days.", "But that's already the law and that doesn't help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions.", "There's a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts.", "It wasn't a government takeover of health care.", "It was the largest expansion of private insurance.", "But what it does say is that \"insurers, you've got to take everybody.\"", "Now, that also means that you've got more customers.", "But when -- when Governor Romney says that he'll replace it with something, but can't detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isn't a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem.", " It just reminds me of, you know, he says that he's going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan.", "That's how it's going to be paid for, but we don't know the details.", "He says that he's going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don't know exactly which ones.", "He won't tell us.", "He now says he's going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don't have to worry.", "And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good?", "Is it -- is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them?", "No.", "The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we've got to make choices.", "And the choices we've made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country.", " No.", "I -- I have to respond to that.", " Which is -- which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and -- and lay down a piece of legislation and say, \"It's my way or the highway,\" I don't get a lot done.", "What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago.", "When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster.", "He said he was going to lower tax rates.", "He said he was going to broaden the base.", "You've said the same thing, you're going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base.", "Those are my principles.", "I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families.", "And I'm going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what -- what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance?", "One way, for instance, would be to have a single number.", "Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000.", "Anybody can have deductions up to that amount.", "And then that number disappears for high-income people.", "That's one way one could do it.", "One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way.", "There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth.", "And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre-existing condition plan.", "You obviously studied up on -- on my plan.", "In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions.", "That's part of my health care plan.", "And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state.", "And I said that at that time.", "The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy.", " Well, I definitely think there are differences.", " The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe.", "That's its most basic function.", "And as commander-in-chief, that is something that I've worked on and thought about every single day that I've been in the Oval Office.", "But I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed.", "Look, the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions.", " But as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together.", "So, in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said, let's help to finance the Transcontinental Railroad, let's start the National Academy of Sciences, let's start land grant colleges, because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans, because if all Americans are getting opportunity, we're all going to be better off.", "That doesn't restrict people's freedom.", "That enhances it.", "And so what I've tried to do as president is to apply those same principles.", "And when it comes to education what I've said is we've got to reform schools that are not working.", "We use something called Race to the Top.", "Wasn't a top-down approach, Governor.", "What we've said is to states, we'll give you more money if you initiate reforms.", "And as a consequence, you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference.", "But what I've also said is let's hire another 100,000 math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed.", "And hard-pressed states right now can't all do that.", "In fact we've seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesn't think we need more teachers.", "I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help.", "It can't do it all, but it can make a difference.", "And as a consequence we'll have a better trained workforce and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where we've got a skilled workforce.", " Well, first, I love great schools.", "Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states.", "And the key to great schools, great teachers.", "So I reject the idea that I don't believe in great teachers or more teachers.", "Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own.", "The role of government: Look behind us.", "The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.", "The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents.", " First, life and liberty.", "We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none.", "I do not believe in cutting our military.", "I believe in maintaining the strength of America's military.", "Second, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country.", "That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose.", "I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can't care for themselves are cared by -- by one another.", "We're a nation that believes that we're all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled.", "We care for them.", "And we -- we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens.", "But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals.", "And what we're seeing right now is, in my view, a -- a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams.", "And it's not working.", "And the proof of that is 23 million people out of work.", "The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty.", "The proof of that is we've gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps.", "The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can't find work.", " We know that the path we're taking is not working.", "It's time for a new path.", " Well, the primary responsibility for education is -- is, of course, at the state and local level.", "But the federal government also can play a very important role.", "And I -- and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, he's -- some ideas he's put forward on Race to the Top, not all of them, but some of them I agree with and -- and congratulate him for pursuing that.", "The federal government can get local and -- and state schools to do a better job.", "My own view, by the way, is I've added to that.", "I happen to believe, I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I -- these are disabled kids or -- or -- or poor kids or -- or lower-income kids, rather, I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice.", "So all federal funds, instead of going to the -- to the state or to the school district, I'd have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their -- their -- their student.", " Well, as I've indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play.", "Through our Race to the Top program, we've worked with Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major reforms, and they're having an impact right now.", " You know, this is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices.", "So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it we're having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference.", "You know, his -- his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney's talked about.", "And it wasn't very detailed.", "This seems to be a trend.", "But -- but what it did do is to -- if you extrapolated how much money we're talking about, you'd look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent.", " When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now.", "And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they're setting up their training programs...", " Let me just finish the point.", "(CROSSTALK)", " The -- where they're partnering so that they're designing training programs.", "And people who are going through them know that there's a job waiting for them if they complete it.", "That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support.", "Let me just say one final example.", "When it comes to making college affordable, whether it's two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed.", "So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system.", "And we said, \"Why not cut out the middleman?\"", "And as a consequence, what we've been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans.", "And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference.", "Governor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that, you know, \"you should borrow money from your parents to go to college,\" you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver, just don't have that option.", "And for us to be able to make sure that they've got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids.", "It's how we're going to grow this economy over the long term.", " Mr. President, Mr. President, you're entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts.", "All right, I'm not going to cut education funding.", "I don't have any plan to cut education funding and -- and grants that go to people going to college.", "I'm planning on (inaudible) to grow.", "So I'm not planning on making changes there.", "But you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is.", "You put $90 billion into -- into green jobs.", "And I -- look, I'm all in favor of green energy.", "$90 billion, that would have -- that would have hired 2 million teachers.", "$90 billion.", "And these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business.", "A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns.", "Look, the right course for America's government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the economic player, picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world.", "The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective?", "How do we get schools to be more competitive?", "Let's grade them.", "I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a -- to a school that he's being more successful.", "I don't want to cut our commitment to education.", "I wanted to make it more effective and efficient.", "And by the way, I've had that experience.", "I don't just talk about it.", "I've been there.", "Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation.", "This is not because I didn't have commitment to education.", "It's because I care about education for all of our kids.", " You've done a great job.", " Jim, I had the great experience -- it didn't seem like it at the time -- of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat.", "And that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done.", "We drove our schools to be number one in the nation.", "We cut taxes 19 times.", " We -- as president, I will sit on day one -- actually, the day after I get elected -- I'll sit down with leaders -- the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and continue -- as we did in my state -- we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the -- in the -- in our state in that case.", "We have to work on a collaborative basis, not because we're going to compromise our principle, but because there's common ground.", "And the challenges America faces right now -- look, the reason I'm in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country.", "And we face -- this deficit could crush the future generations.", "What's happening in the Middle East, there are developments around the world that are of real concern.", " And Republicans and Democrats both love America.", "But we need to have leadership -- leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if -- if it's a Republican or a Democrat.", "I've done it before.", "I'll do it again.", " Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney's going to have a busy first day, because he's also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as you're sitting down with them.", "(LAUGHTER)  But, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they're advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class.", "That's how we cut taxes for middle- class families and small businesses.", "That's how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasn't advancing that cause.", "That's how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world.", "That's how we repealed \"don't ask/don't tell.\"", "That's how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and that's how we're going to wind down the war in Afghanistan.", "That's how we went after Al Qaida and bin Laden.", "So we've -- we've seen progress even under Republican control of the House of Representatives.", "But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, \"I'll sit down,\" but you have to have a plan.", "Number two, what's important is occasionally you've got to say no, to -- to -- to folks both in your own party and in the other party.", "And, you know, yes, have we had some fights between me and the Republicans when -- when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of Wall Street?", "Absolutely, because that was a fight that needed to be had.", "When -- when we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no, yes, that was a fight that we needed to have.", " And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things.", "And I've got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party.", " Well, Jim, I want to thank you, and I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think was a terrific debate, and I very much appreciate it.", "And I want to thank the University of Denver.", "You know, four years ago, we were going through a major crisis.", "And yet my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished.", "And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she's gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn't lay off workers during a recession.", "The auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride, that they're helping to build America.", "And so the question now is how do we build on those strengths.", "And everything that I've tried to do, and everything that I'm now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing American energy or making sure that we're closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the United States, or closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allows us to invest in our future.", "All those things are designed to make sure that the American people, their genius, their grit, their determination, is -- is channeled and -- and they have an opportunity to succeed.", "And everybody's getting a fair shot.", "And everybody's getting a fair share -- everybody's doing a fair share, and everybody's playing by the same rules.", "You know, four years ago, I said that I'm not a perfect man and I wouldn't be a perfect president.", "And that's probably a promise that Governor Romney thinks I've kept.", "But I also promised that I'd fight every single day on behalf of the American people, the middle class, and all those who were striving to get into the middle class.", "I've kept that promise and if you'll vote for me, then I promise I'll fight just as hard in a second term.", " Thank you, Jim, and Mr. President.", "And thank you for tuning in this evening.", "This is a -- this is an important election and I'm concerned about America.", "I'm concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years.", "I -- I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals.", "It's bigger than our respective parties.", "It's an election about the course of America.", "What kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children.", "And there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening, and over the course of this month we're going to have two more presidential debates and a vice presidential debate.", "We're talk about those two paths.", "But they lead in very different directions.", "And it's not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of where they go.", "You can look at the record.", "There's no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected you'll continue to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up.", "I'll get incomes up again.", "You'll see chronic unemployment.", "We've had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent.", "If I'm president I will create -- help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes.", "If the president's reelected, Obamacare will be fully installed.", "In my view that's going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past.", "Many will lose it.", "You're going to see health premiums go up by some $2,500 per family.", "If I'm elected we won't have Obama.", "We'll put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and we'll focus on getting the cost of health care down.", "If the president were to be reelected you're going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare.", "You'll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare Advantage.", "You'll have hospital and providers that'll no longer accept Medicare patients.", "I'll restore that $716 billion to Medicare.", "And finally, military.", "The president's reelected you'll see dramatic cuts to our military.", "The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating.", "I will not cut our commitment to our military.", "I will keep America strong and get America's middle class working again.", "Thank you, Jim.", " I want to thank the people here in Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, for sponsoring this and making it possible.", "And I'm delighted to be here tonight with you, Joe.", "I too want to avoid any personal attacks.", "I promise not to bring up your singing.", "(LAUGHTER)", " Good.", "I think this is an extraordinarily important decision we'll make on November 7th.", "We're really going to choose between what I consider to be an old way of governing ourselves of high levels of spending, high taxes, ever more intrusive bureaucracy or a new course, a new era, if you will.", "And Governor Bush and I want to offer that new course of action.", "With respect to the surplus, Bernie, we have to make some kind of forecast.", "We can't make 12-month decisions in this business.", "We're talking about the kinds of fundamental changes in programs and government that are going to affect people's lives for the next 25 or 30 years.", "And while it may be a little risky in some respects from an economic standpoint to try to forecast surpluses, I think we have to make some planning assumption to proceed.", "We care a great deal about the issues at stake here.", "One of the difficulties we have, frankly, for the last eight years we ignored a lot of these problems.", "We haven't moved aggressively on Social Security, on Medicare.", "There are important issues out there that need to be resolved.", "It's important for us to get on with that business.", "That's what Governor Bush and I want to do.", " I think public education is a solution.", "Our desire is to find ways to reform our educational system, to return it to its former glory.", "I'm a product of public schools, my family, wife and daughters all went to public schools.", "We believe very much in the public school system.", "But if you look at where we are from the standpoint of the nation, recent exams.", "For example, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, an independent testing service, shows there's been no progress on reading scores in the last eight years.", "Almost no progress on math.", "The achievement gap between minority and non-minority students is as big as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever been.", "We've had a significant increase in spending for education nationwide, but it has produced almost no positive results.", "That's unacceptable from our standpoint.", "If you look at it and think about it, we now have in our most disadvantaged communities, 70% of our fourth graders can't read at the basic level of understanding.", "We've graduated 15 million kids from high school in the last few years who can't read at a significant level.", "They are permanently sentenced to a lifetime of failure.", "What we want to do is to change that.", "We think we know how to do it.", "Governor Bush has done it in Texas.", "We want to emphasize local control so that people here in Danville, KY decide what is best for their kids.", "We want to insist on high standards.", "One of the worst things we can do is fail to establish high standards, in effect to say to a youngster because of their ethnic background or income level, we don't have the same kind of expectations from you that we have from everybody else.", "We want accountability.", "We have to test every child every year to know whether or not we're making progress with respect to achieving those goals and objectives.", "We think it's extraordinarily important.", "Probably the single most important issue in this campaign.", "Governor Bush has made it clear that when he's elected this will be his number one priority as a legislative measure to submit to the Congress.", " This is a very important issue, Bernie.", "Maybe we could extend on education for a moment.", " Yes.", " Thank you, sir.", " Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talk about this question of the surplus because it drives a lot of what we're talking about here, Joe.", "If you look at our proposal, we take half of the projected surplus and set it aside for Social Security.", "Over $2.4 trillion.", "We take roughly a fourth of it for other urgent priorities such as Medicare reform and education, several of these other key programs we want to support.", "And we take roughly one-fourth of it and return it in the form of a tax cut to the American taxpayer.", "We think it's extraordinarily important to do that.", "It is a fundamental difference between our two approaches.", "If you look, frankly, by our numbers and the numbers of the Senate Budget Committee, which has totaled up all the promises that Vice President Gore has made during the course of the campaign, they are some $900 billion in spending over and above that surplus already and we still have a month to go in the campaign.", "The fact is that the program that we put together we think is very responsible.", "Suggestion that somehow all of it is going for tax cuts isn't true.", "Another way to look at it is over the course of the next ten years we'll collect roughly $25 trillion in revenue.", "We want to take about 5% of that and return that to the American taxpayer in the form of tax relief.", "We have the highest level of taxation now we've had since World War II.", "The average American family is paying about 40% in federal, state and local taxes.", "We think it is appropriate to return to the American people so that they can make choices themselves in how that money ought to be spent; whether on education, retirement or on paying their bills.", "It is their choice and it is their prerogative.", "We want to give them the opportunity to make those kinds of choices for themselves and we think this is a totally reasonable approach.", " I share the view that we ought to have equal pay for equal work regardless of someone's gender.", "We have made progress in recent years, but I think we have a ways to go.", "It's not just about the differential with respect to women.", "If you look at our opponent's tax proposal, they discriminate between stay-at-home moms with children that they take care of themselves and those who go to work or who, in fact, have their kids taken care of outside the home.", "You, in effect, as a stay-at-home mom get no tax advantage under the Gore tax plan as contrasted with the Bush proposal.", "It provides tax relief for absolutely everybody who pays taxes.", "It's important to understand the things we're trying to change and address in the course of the campaign and what our agenda is for the future, our plans are for the future, focus very much about giving as much control as we can to individual Americans, be they men or women, be they single or married, as much control as possible over their own lives, especially in the area of taxation.", "We want to make certain that the American people have the ability to keep more of what they earn and then they can get to decide how to spend it.", "The proposal we have from Al Gore, basically, doesn't do that.", "It in effect lays out some 29 separate tax credits.", "If you live your life the way they want you to live your life, if you behave in a certain way, you qualify for a tax credit and at that point you get some relief.", "Bottom line, though, is 50 million American taxpayers out there get no advantages at all out of the Gore tax proposal, whereas under the Bush plan everybody who pays taxes will get tax relief.", " Depends on what he says.", " You have to be a CPA to understand what he just said.", "The fact of the matter is the plan is so complex that the ordinary American is never going to ever figure out what they even qualify for.", "It's a classic example of wanting to have a program, in this case a tax program, that will, in fact, direct people to live their lives in certain ways rather than empowering them to make decisions for themselves.", "It is a big difference between us.", "They like tax credits, we like tax reform and tax cuts.", " The abortion issue is a very tough one, without question, and a very important one.", "Governor Bush and I have emphasized while, while we are clearly both pro-life, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we believe.", "We want to reduce the incidence of abortion on our society.", "Many on the pro-choice side have said the same thing.", "Even Bill Clinton has advocated reducing abortion to make it as rare as possible.", "With respect to the question of RU-486, we believe that -- of course, that it's recently been approved by the FDA.", "That really was a question of whether or not it was safe to be used by women.", "They didn't address the sort of the question of whether or not there should or should not be abortion in the society so much as evaluate that particular drug.", "What we would like to be able to do is to look for ways to reach across the divide between the two points of view and find things that we can do together to reduce the incidence of abortion.", "Such things as promoting adoption as an alternative.", "Encouraging parental notification.", "And we also think banning the horrific practice of partial birth abortions is an area where there could be agreement.", "Congress has twice passed by overwhelming margins, a significant number of votes from both parties, the ban on partial birth abortions.", "Twice it's been vetoed by Bill Clinton and Al Gore.", "We would hope eventually they would recognize that's not a good position for them to be in.", "With respect to the RU-486 proposal, at this stage I haven't looked in particular at that particular piece of legislation.", "Governor Bush made it clear the other night he did not anticipate that he would be able to go in and direct the FDA to reverse course on that particular issue, primarily because the decision they made was on the drug, not the question of whether or not it would support abortion.", " I noted, Bernie, like Joe, I'm pleased to see what happened in Yugoslavia today.", "I hope it marks the end of Milosevic.", "I think probably more than anything else it's a victory for the Serbian people.", "They've taken to the streets to support their democracy, to support their vote.", "In some respects this is a continuation of a process that began ten years ago all across eastern Europe and has only now arrived in Serbia.", "We saw it in Germany, we saw it in Rumania, we saw it in Czechoslovakia, as the people of eastern Europe rose up and made their claim for freedom.", "And I think we all admire that.", "I think with respect to how this process has been managed most recently, we want to do everything we can to support Mr. Milosevic's departure.", "Certainly, though, that would not involve committing U.S. troops.", "I do think it's noteworthy that there appears to be an effort underway to get the Russians involved.", "I noted the other night, for example, Tuesday night at the debate in Boston, Governor Bush suggested exactly that we ought to try to get the Russians involved to exercise some leverage over the Serbians.", "It's now clear from the press that, in fact, that's exactly what they were doing.", "It's -- Governor Bush was correct in his assessment and his recommendation.", "He has supported the administration on Kosovo.", "He lobbied actively against passage of the Byrd-Warner provision which would have set a specific deadline, one he felt was too soon, for forcing the U.S. troops out.", "He's been supportive of the policy that we've seen with respect to Yugoslavia.", "And I think he deserves a lot of credit for that.", "I would go beyond that.", "I think this is an opportunity for the United States to test President Putin of Russia.", "That in fact now is the time we ought to find out whether he's committed to democracy.", "Whether or not he's willing to support the forces of freedom and democracy diplomatically there in the area of eastern Europe.", "And it's a test for him whether he represents the old guard in the Soviet Union.", "One of the most important challenges we face as a nation is how we manage that process of integrating those 150 million eastern Europeans into the security and economic framework of Europe.", " My preference is to deploy them as warriors.", "There may be occasion when it's appropriate to use them in a peacekeeping role, but I think the role ought to be limited, there ought to be a time limit on it.", "The reason we have a military is to be able to fight and win wars.", "And to maintain with sufficient strength so that would-be adversaries are deterred from ever launching a war in the first place.", "I think that the administration has, in fact, in this area failed in a major responsibility.", "We've seen a reduction in our forces far beyond anything that was justified by the end of the Cold War.", "At the same time we've seen a rapid expansion of our commitments around the world as troops have been sent hither and yon.", "There was testimony before the Joint Chiefs of Staff before the Armed Services Committee that pointed out a lot of these problems.", "For example General Mike Ryan of the Air Force with 40% fewer aircraft, he's now undertaking three times as many deployments on a regular basis as he had to previously.", "We're overcommitted and underresourced.", "This has had some other unfortunate effects.", "I saw a letter the other day from a young captain stationed in Fort Bragg, a graduate of West Point in '95 getting ready to get out of the service because he's only allowed to train with his troops when fuel is available for the vehicles and only allowed to fire their weapons twice a year.", "He's concerned that if he had to send them into combat it would mean lives lost.", "That is a legitimate concern, this is a very important area.", "The fact that the U.S. military is worse off today than it was eight years ago.", "Major responsibility for us in the future, a high priority for myself and Governor Bush to rebuild the U.S. military and to give them the resources they need to do the job we ask them to do for us and give them good leadership.", " Bernie, this is a special interest of mine.", "I would like a chance to elaborate further, if I might.", "The facts are dramatically different.", "I'm not attacking the military, Joe.", "I have enormous regard for the men and women of the U.S. military.", "I had the privilege of working with them for the four years I was the Secretary of Defense.", "No one has a higher regard than I do for them.", "It's irresponsible to suggest we shouldn't have this debate, that we should ignore what is a major, major concern.", "If you have friends and relatives serving in the U.S. military, you know there's a problem.", "If you look at the data that's available, 40% of our Army helicopters are not combat ready.", "The combat readiness level in the Air Force dropped from 85% to 65%.", "Significant problems of retention.", "The important thing for us to remember is that we're a democracy and we're defended by volunteers.", "Everybody out there tonight wearing the uniform, standing on guard to protect the United States is there because they volunteered to put on a uniform.", "When we don't give them the spare parts they need, when we don't give our pilots the flying hours they need to maintain their proficiency, when we don't give them the kind of leadership that spells out what their mission is and let's them know why they're putting their lives at risk, then we undermine that morale.", "That's an extraordinarily valuable trust.", "There is no more important responsibility for a President of the United States than his role as Commander in Chief, and the obligation he undertakes on behalf o fall of us when he decides when to send our young men and women to war.", "When we send them without the right kind of training, when we send them poorly equipped or with equipment that's old and broken down, we put their lives at risk.", "We will suffer more casualties in the next conflict if we don't look to those basic fundamental problems now.", "With all due respect this administration has a bad track record in this regard, and it's available for anybody who wants to look at the record and wants to talk to our men and women in uniform, and wants to spend time with the members of the Joint Chiefs, wants to look at readiness levels and other -- other indicators.", "Final point, the issue of procurement is very important because we're running now off the buildup of the investment we made during the Reagan years.", "As that equipment gets old, it has to be replaced.", "We've taken money out of the procurement budget to support other ventures.", "We have not been investing in the future of the U.S. military.", " Bernie, it has been a very, very difficult area to work in for a long time.", "Numerous administrations going back certainly to World War II have had to wrestle with the problem of what should happen to the Middle East.", "We made significant breakthroughs, I think, at the end of the Bush administration because of the Gulf War.", "In effect, we had joined together with Arab allies and done enormous damage to the Iraqi armed forces.", "Iraq was the biggest military threat to Israel.", "By virtue of the end of the Cold War, the Soviets were no longer a factor.", "They used to fish in troubled waters whenever they had the opportunity in the Middle East.", "With the end of the Soviet Union, the implosion of the empire, that created a vacuum if you will, and made it easier for us to operate there.", "We were able to, I think, reassure both Arabs and Israelis would play a major role there.", "We have the ability and the will to deploy forces if we had to, to engage in military operations to help our friends and oppose our foes.", "We were able to convene them in a conference.", "The first time Arab and Israelis sat down face-to-face and began this process of trying to move the peace process forward.", "I think also a lot of credit goes to some great men like Yitzak Rabin.", "His tragic passing was of great consequence, a great tragedy for everybody who cares about peace in the Middle East.", "He was a man who had the military stature to be able to confidently persuade the Israelis to take risks for peace.", "I think Barak has tried to same thing.", "I hope that we can get this resolved as soon as possible.", "My guess is the next administration is going to be the one that is going to have to come to grips with the current state of affairs there.", "I think it's very important that we have an administration where we have a president with firm leadership who has the kind of track record of dealing straight with people, of keeping his word so friends and allies both respect us and our adversaries fear us.", " We might have no other choice.", "We'll have to see if that happens.", "The thing about Iraq, of course, was at the end of the war we had pretty well decimated their military.", "We had put them back in the box, so to speak.", "We had a strong international coalition raid against them, effective economic sanctions, and a very robust inspection regime was in place under the U.N. auspices and it was able to do a good job of stripping out the capacity to build weapons of mass destruction, the work he had been doing that had not been destroyed during the war in biological and chemical agents, as well as a nuclear program.", "Unfortunately now we find ourselves in a situation where that started to fray on us, where the coalition now no longer is tied tightly together.", "Recently the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, two Gulf States, have reopened diplomatic relations with Baghdad.", "The Russians and French are flying commercial airliners back into Baghdad and thumbing their nose at the international sanctions regime, and of course U.N. inspectors have been kicked out and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been absolutely no response.", ".", "We're in a situation today where our posture with Iraq is weaker than it was at the end of the war.", "It's unfortunate.", "I also think it's unfortunate we find ourselves in a position where we don't know for sure what might be transpiring inside Iraq.", "I certainly hope he's not regenerating that kind of capability, but if he were, if in fact Saddam Hussein were taking steps to try to rebuild nuclear capability or weapons of mass destruction, you would have to give very serious consideration to military action to -- to stop that activity.", "I don't think you can afford to have a man like Saddam Hussein with nuclear weapons in the Middle East.", " This is an area, again, where I think again Joe and I have fairly significant disagreements.", "My assessment is that there is no comprehensive energy policy today.", "That as a nation, we are in trouble because the administration has not addressed these issues.", "We have the prospects of brownouts in California.", "We have a potential home heating oil crisis in the northeast.", "We have gasoline price rises in various other places.", "For years now the administration has talked about reducing our dependence on foreign sources of oil, but they haven't done it.", "In fact, we've gone exactly in the opposite direction.", "We have the lowest rate of domestic production of oil now in 46 years.", "You have to go back to 1954 to find a time when we produced as little oil as we do today.", "Our imports are at an all-time record high.", "In June we imported almost 12 million barrels of oil a day.", "That means we are more subject to the wide fluctuations and swings in price.", "We have other problems.", "We don't have refinery capacity.", "We haven't built a new refinery in this country for over ten years.", "They're operating at 96% or 97% capacity.", "Even with more crude available they're probably not going to be able to do very much by way of producing additional home heating oil for this winter.", "We have a growing problem with our growing dependence on foreign sources of energy.", "That will allways be the case but we ought to be able to shift the trend and begin to move it in the right direction.", "We need to do a lot more about generating the capacity for power here at home.", "We need to get on with the business and we think we can do it very safely in an environmentally sound manner.", "We don't think we ought to buy into this false choice that somehow we cannot develop energy resources without being cautious with the environment.", "We can.", "We have the technology to do it and we ought to do it.", "We do support the low income energy assistance program.", "We think it's important that senior citizens don't suffer this winter, but we need to get on to the business of having a plan to develop our domestic energy resources in producing more supplies, and this administration hasn't produced them.", " It shows I have a balanced approach to how we deal with environmental issues.", " No.", "I think we have to make choices.", "The Wyoming wilderness bill, frankly was one of my proudest achievements as a member of Congress.", "I worked on that with my good friend Al Simpson for about four years.", "We set aside a part of Wyoming, nearly a million acres of wilderness that ought to be separate and not be developed.", "We think that was important.", "There are a lot of areas around the country where Governor Bush and I support restraint.", "For example we support the moratorium on drilling off the coast of California, but there are places where we think we ought to go forward and develop those resources.", "The Arctic National Wildlife Reserve is one of them.", "It's on the north slope right next to Prudhoe Bay.", "The infrastructure is there to be able to deliver that product to market.", "We think we can do it given today's technology in a way that will not damage the environment, will not permanently marr the countryside at all, and so what we're looking for with respect to environmental policy and energy policy is balance.", "We do have to make choices, we recognize that.", "The way you phrased the question, frankly I welcome because it shows, in fact, we are trying to pursue a balanced approach and the suggestion that somehow all we care about is energy development isn't true.", "But we do have to get on with developing those resources or we're going to find ourselves ever more dependent on foreign sources.", "We're going to find that the fact that we don't have an energy policy out there is one of the major storm clouds on the horizon for our economy.", "I think if you look for something that could develop, some problem that could arise, that might, in fact, jeopardize our continuing prosperity, it's the possibility that we might find ourselves without adequate supplies of energy in the future.", "And there would be no quicker way to shut down our economy than that.", " You won't be surprised if I disagree with Joe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s description.", "The Social Security system is in trouble.", "It's been a fantastic program and has been there for 65 years that has provided benefits for senior citizens over that period of time.", "For my parents.", "It means a great deal to millions of Americans.", "And Governor Bush and I want to make absolutely certain that the first thing we do is guarantee the continuation of those payments, those benefits and keep those promises that were made.", "But if you look down the road, you say you're 30 years old today, and I have two daughters about that age.", "They seriously question whether or not there will be any system left for them.", "That's because the demographics that work out there, it's almost an iron law.", "They know how many people there are, when they reach retirement, we know when the baby boom generation is coming along, how long they will live after that, it will drive the system into bankruptcy unless we reform and deal with it.", "The reform we would like to offer is to allow our young people to begin to take a portion of the payroll tax, 2% of it, and invest it in a personal retirement account.", "That does several things.", "First of all, it gives them a stake in the Social Security system.", "That becomes their property.", "They own it.", "They can pass it on to their kids if they want.", "They don't have that kind of equity in Social Security today.", "Secondly, we can generate a higher return off that investment than you get in the existing system.", "Today you get about a 2% return of what you pay into Social Security.", "We think we can generate at least 6%.", "At least three times what we're able to get now.", "And long-term by generating a bigger return, we'll put additional funds into the system that will help us survive that crunch that is otherwise going to hit in the future.", "Bottom line is there's a choice here.", "With respect to Al Gore and Joe's plan, they don't reform Social Security.", "They add another huge obligation on top of it that future generations will have to pay.", "They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t touch the basic system itself.", "They don't reform it and don't save it.", "We have a plan to do that and a plan to give our young people a choice and more control over their own lives.", " Well, I think there are a number of ways to do it.", "First of all, I agree with your assessment.", "I've been out of Washington for the last eight years and spent the last five years running a company global concern.", "And been out in the private sector building a business, hiring people, creating jobs.", "I have a different perspective on Washington than I had when I was there in the past.", "I'm proud of my service for 25 years, but also proud I had the opportunity to go out and get a different experience.", "And you're absolutely right.", "People are fed up.", "They've had enough with the bickering and the partisanship that seems to characterize the debate that goes on in the nation's capital.", "I've seen it done differently though.", "I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen it in Texas.", "I've watched George Bush.", "And one of the reasons I was eager to sign on when he asked me to become his running mate is because I've been so tremendously impressed with what he's done as the Governor of Texas.", "He came in when he had a legislature completely controlled by the other party.", "He managed to reach across partisan lines and unite republicans, and democrats and independents and put them to work to achieve good things for the State of Texas.", "Partly because he didn't point the finger of blame looking for scapegoats he was quick to share the credit.", "He ended up, as a result of that activity of his first term, having the top Democrat in the state, Bob Bulloch, endorse George Bush for reelection.", "It's possible to change the tone.", "It is possible to get people to work together and to begin to focus on achieving results.", "I think it will take new leadership.", "I don't think you can do it, with all due respect to Al Gore, with somebody who spent all the last 24 years in that Washington environment and who campaigns on the basis of castigating others, pointing the finger of blame at others in terms of blaming business or various groups for failings.", "I think you have to be able to reach out and work together and build coalitions.", "I think George W. Bush has done it in Texas and can do it at the national level.", " With all due respect, Joe, there's an awful lot of evidence that there hasn't been any bipartisan leadership out of this administration or Al Gore.", "The fact is the Medicare problems have not been addressed.", "We have had eight years of problems with prescription drugs not being addressed.", "Social Security problem\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been addressed.", "The educational problem has not been addressed.", "We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had eight years of talk but no action.", "They've been in a position of responsibility in the White House.", "The powerful interests, if you will, in Washington, D.C. and been unable to work with others.", "Medicare is a good example.", "The Breaux Commission, a good effort at a bipartisan solution for Medicare whether you bought or didn't buy the answer that was generated, the fact is the administration set it up and pulled the plug on it because they would rather have an issue, not a solution.", "They haven't lead from a bipartisan standpoint and I think Al Gore's record isn't very good.", " I can tell you, Joe, the government had absolutely nothing to do with it.", "(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)", " I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to try to help you do that, Joe.", " Bernie, I would like to answer your question to the best of my ability, but I don't think I can understand fully what it would be like.", "I try hard to put myself in that position and imagine what it would be like, but I've always been part of the majority, never part of a minority group.", "It has to be a horrible experience.", "The sense of anger and frustration and rage that go with knowing that the only reason you were stopped, the only reason you were arrested, was because of the color of your skin would make me extraordinarily angry, and I'm not sure how I would respond.", "I think that we have to recognize that while we've made enormous progress in the U.S. in racial relations and come a great long way, we still have a very long way to go.", "We still have not only the problems we're talking about here tonight in terms of the problems you mentioned in profiling, but beyond that, we still have an achievement gap in education, income differentials, differences in life span.", "We still have, I think, a society that -- where we haven't done enough yet to live up to that standard that we'd all like to live up to.", "I think in terms of equality of opportunity, that we judge people as individuals.", "As Martin Luther King said, we ought to judge people on the content of their character instead of the color of their skin.", "I would hope we can continue to make progress int that regard in the years ahead.", " This is a tough one, Bernie.", "The fact of the matter is we live in a free society, and freedom means freedom for everybody.", "We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to choose, and we shouldn't be able to choose and say you get to live free and you don't.", "That means people should be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to enter into.", "It's no one's business in terms of regulating behavior in that regard.", "The next step then, of course, is the question you ask of whether or not there ought to be some kind of official sanction of the relationships or if these relationships should be treated the same as a traditional marriage.", "That's a tougher problem.", "That's not a slam dunk.", "The fact of the matter is that it is regulated by the states.", "I think different states are likely to come to different conclusions, and that's appropriate.", "I don't think there should necessarily be a federal policy in this area.", "I try to be open minded about it as much as I can and tolerant of those relationships.", "And like Joe, I'm also wrestling with the extent to which there ought to be legal sanction of those relationships.", "I think we ought to do everything we can to tolerate and accommodate whatever kind of relationships people want to enter into.", " We clearly come from different political perspectives.", "Joe is a Democrat from New England, I'm a Republican from the west, from Wyoming.", "And I think that weighs into it to some extent.", "Clearly we're both in the positions we're in because of our personal relationships with our principals.", "I think the areas that I would bring are the things that Governor Bush emphasized when he picked me.", "That I have been White House Chief of Staff and ran the White House under President Ford.", "Spent ten years in the House, eight of that in the leadership.", "Served as Secretary of Defense, and then had significant experience in the private sector.", "I think that where there are differences between Joe and myself in terms of background and experience, I clearly have spent a lot of time in executive positions running large organizations both in private business as well as in government.", "And that is a set of qualifications that Governor Bush found attractive when he selected me.", "I'll leave it at that.", " We've been trying very hard to keep this on a high plane, Bernie.", " I do have a couple of concerns where I like the old Joe Lieberman better than I do the new Joe Lieberman.", "Let's see if I can put them in those terms.", "Joe established an outstanding record, I thought, in his work on this whole question of violence in the media.", "And the kinds of materials that were being peddled to our children.", "And many of us on the Republican side admired him for that.", "There is, I must say, the view now that having joined with Al Gore on the ticket on the other side, that the depth of conviction that we had admired before isn't quite as strong as it was, perhaps, in the past.", "The temptation on the one hand to criticize the activities of the industry, as was pointed out recently in the Federal Trade Commission where they're taking clearly material meant for adults and selling it to our children, while at the same time they are participating in fundraising events with some of the people responsible for that activity has been a source of concern for many of us.", "We were especially disturbed, Joe, at a recent fundraiser you attended where there was a comedian that got up and criticized George Bush's religion.", "I know you're not responsible for having uttered any words of criticism of his religion.", "My concern would be, frankly, that you haven't been as -- as consistent as you had been in the past.", "That a lot of your good friends like Bill Bennett and others of us who had admired your firmness of purpose over the years have felt that you're not quite the crusader for that cause that you once were.", " Bernie, I want to thank you and Joe as well.", "I've enjoyed the debate this evening.", "And thank the folks here at the Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done a tremendous job of making this possible.", "This is a very important decision you're going to make on November 7.", "We have a fundamental choice between whether or not we continue with our old ways of big government, high taxes and ever more intrusive bureaucracy, or whether we take a new course for a new era.", "Governor Bush and I want to pursue the new course.", "We want to reform the Social Security system to guarantee benefits will be there for our retired folks, as well as make it possible for our young people to invest a portion of their payroll tax into a retirement account that they'll control and give them greater control over their own lives.", "We want to reform the Medicare system to make certain the benefits are there for our senior citizens, but also to provide prescription drug coverage for them and give them a range of choices in terms of the kind of insurance we have.", "We want to reform the education system.", "We want to restore our public schools to the greatness they once represented so that every parent has the opportunity to choose what is best for their child and so that every child has an opportunity to share in the American dream.", "We also want to reform the tax code.", "We think it's very important now that we have a surplus, that a portion of that surplus go back to the people who earned it.", "It's not the government's money, it's your money.", "You're entitled to it, and we would like to see to it that we provide tax relief for everybody who pays taxes.", "Finally, we think it's very important to rebuild the U.S. military.", "The military is in trouble.", "The trends are in the wrong direction.", "The finest men and women in uniform that you'll find anyplace in the world but they deserve our support.", "They deserve the resources that we need to provide for them and they deserve good leadership.", "George Bush is the man to do this.", "I've seen him do it in Texas.", "What we need is to be able to reach across the aisle.", "Put together coalitions of Republicans and Democrats and build the kinds of coalitions that will get something done, finally, in Washington.", "George Bush is good man, an honorable man, a man of great integrity.", "He will make a first rate president.", " Mr. Smith, Mr. Nixon.", "In the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln said the question was whether this nation could exist half-slave or half-free.", "In the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half-slave or half-free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, in the direction of the road that we are taking, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery.", "I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain.", "We discuss tonight domestic issues, but I would not want that to be any implication to be given that this does not involve directly our struggle with Mr. Khrushchev for survival.", "Mr. Khrushchev is in New York, and he maintains the Communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the Soviet Union itself.", "The Chinese Communists have always had a large population.", "But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country.", "The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom.", "If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if we're moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world.", "If we fail, then freedom fails.", "Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do?", "Are we as strong as we should be?", "Are we as strong as we must be if we're going to maintain our independence, and if we're going to maintain and hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to us for assistance, to those who look to us for survival?", "I should make it very clear that I do not think we're doing enough, that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we're making.", "This is a great country, but I think it could be a greater country; and this is a powerful country, but I think it could be a more powerful country.", "I'm not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel-mill capacity unused.", "I'm not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world.", "Because economic growth means strength and vitality; it means we're able to sustain our defenses; it means we're able to meet our commitments abroad.", "I'm not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food - some of it rotting - even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual.", "I saw cases in West Virginia, here in the United States, where children took home part of their school lunch in order to feed their families because I don't think we're meeting our obligations toward these Americans.", "I'm not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are.", "I'm not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part-time shifts.", "I think we should have an educational system second to none.", "I'm not satisfied when I see men like Jimmy Hoffa - in charge of the largest union in the United States - still free.", "I'm not satisfied when we are failing to develop the natural resources of the United States to the fullest.", "Here in the United States, which developed the Tennessee Valley and which built the Grand Coulee and the other dams in the Northwest United States at the present rate of hydropower production - and that is the hallmark of an industrialized society - the Soviet Union by 1975 will be producing more power than we are.", "These are all the things, I think, in this country that can make our society strong, or can mean that it stands still.", "I'm not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights.", "If a Negro baby is born - and this is true also of Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in some of our cities - he has about one-half as much chance to get through high school as a white baby.", "He has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student.", "He has about a third as much chance to be a professional man, about half as much chance to own a house.", "He has about uh - four times as much chance that he'll be out of work in his life as the white baby.", "I think we can do better.", "I don't want the talents of any American to go to waste.", "I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government.", "I don't at all.", "I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities.", "And I want the states to meet their responsibilities.", "But I think there is also a national responsibility.", "The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty-five years.", "The people of the United States individually could not have developed the Tennessee Valley; collectively they could have.", "A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so.", "Seventeen million Americans, who live over sixty-five on an average Social Security check of about seventy-eight dollars a month, they're not able to sustain themselves individually, but they can sustain themselves through the social security system.", "I don't believe in big government, but I believe in effective governmental action.", "And I think that's the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom.", "It's the only way that we're going to move ahead.", "I think we can do a better job.", "I think we're going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us.", "We cannot turn the job over to anyone else.", "If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails.", "And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country.", "The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States.", "Because they felt that the American society was moving again.", "I want us to recapture that image.", "I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how we're doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese Communists.", "That is the obligation upon our generation.", "In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt said in his inaugural that this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny.", "I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous.", "The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack - attack it has ever known?", "I think it can be.", "And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here.", "I think it's time America started moving again.", " Mr. Smith, Senator Kennedy.", "The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with.", "There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position.", "There is no question but that this nation cannot stand still; because we are in a deadly competition, a competition not only with the men in the Kremlin, but the men in Peking.", "We're ahead in this competition, as Senator Kennedy, I think, has implied.", "But when you're in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead.", "And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the United States should move ahead.", "Where, then, do we disagree?", "I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still.", "We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world.", "Now last year, of course, was 1958.", "That happened to be a recession year.", "But when we look at the growth of G.N.P.", "this year, a year of recovery, we find that it's six and nine-tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today.", "More about that later.", "Looking then to this problem of how the United States should move ahead and where the United States is moving, I think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner: Let's look at the record.", "Is the United States standing still?", "Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation?", "Is it true that, as far as this country is concerned, in the field of electric power, in all of the fields that he has mentioned, we have not been moving ahead.", "Well, we have a comparison that we can make.", "We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration.", "When we compare these two records in the areas that Senator Kennedy has - has discussed tonight, I think we find that America has been moving ahead.", "Let's take schools.", "We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years.", "Let's take hydroelectric power.", "We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history.", "Let us take hospitals.", "We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration.", "The same is true of highways.", "Let's put it in terms that all of us can understand.", "We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen percent over seven years.", "That shows that there's been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor.", "But let's not put it there; let's put it in terms of the average family.", "What has happened to you?", "We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration.", "What about the prices you pay?", "We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration.", "What's the net result of this?", "This means that the average family income went up fifteen per cent in the Eisenhower years as against two percent in the Truman years.", "Now, this is not standing still.", "But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isn't enough.", "A record is never something to stand on.", "It's something to build on.", "And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress.", "And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way.", "Senator Kennedy has suggested that he believes he knows the way.", "I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion.", "But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new.", "They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it.", "And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then.", "What kind of programs are we for?", "We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people.", "We are for programs, in addition, which will see that our medical care for the aged are - is - are much - is much better handled than it is at the present time.", "Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims.", "We both want to help the old people.", "We want to see that they do have adequate medical care.", "The question is the means.", "I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates.", "I could give better examples, but for - for whatever it is, whether it's in the field of housing, or health, or medical care, or schools, or the eh- development of electric power, we have programs which we believe will move America, move her forward and build on the wonderful record that we have made over these past seven and a half years.", "Now, when we look at these programs, might I suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much you're spending.", "I will concede that in all the areas to which I have referred Senator Kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than I would have it spend.", "I costed out the cost of the Democratic platform.", "It runs a minimum of thirteen and two-tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than we're presently spending.", "Now the Republican platform will cost more too.", "It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than we're presently spending.", "Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours?", "Not at all.", "Because it isn't a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn't a question of which government does the most.", "It is a question of which administration does the right thing.", "And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans.", "I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress.", "The final point that I would like to make is this: Senator Kennedy has suggested in his speeches that we lack compassion for the poor, for the old, and for others that are unfortunate.", "Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere.", "I know what it means to be poor.", "I know what it means to see people who are unemployed.", "I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals.", " Well, the Vice President and I came to the Congress together 1946; we both served in the Labor Committee.", "I've been there now for fourteen years, the same period of time that he has, so that our experience in uh - government is comparable.", "Secondly, I think the question is uh - what are the programs that we advocate, what is the party record that we lead?", "I come out of the Democratic party, which in this century has produced Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, and which supported and sustained these programs which I've discussed tonight.", "Mr. Nixon comes out of the Republican party.", "He was nominated by it.", "And it is a fact that through most of these last twenty-five years the Republican leadership has opposed federal aid for education, medical care for the aged, development of the Tennessee Valley, development of our natural resources.", "I think Mr. Nixon is an effective leader of his party.", "I hope he would grant me the same.", "The question before us is:which point of view and which party do we want to lead the United States?", " I have no comment.", " It would be rather difficult to cover them in eight and- in two and a half minutes.", "I would suggest that these proposals could be mentioned.", "First, after each of my foreign trips I have made recommendations that have been adopted.", "For example, after my first trip abroad - abroad, I strongly recommended that we increase our exchange programs particularly as they related to exchange of persons of leaders in the labor field and in the information field.", "After my trip to South America, I made recommendations that a separate inter-American lending agency be set up which the South American nations would like much better than a lend- than to participate in the lending agencies which treated all the countries of the world the same.", "Uh - I have made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian refugee situation which were adopted, not only by the President but some of them were enacted into law by the Congress.", "Within the Administration, as a chairman of the President's Committee on Price Stability and Economic Growth, I have had the opportunity to make recommendations which have been adopted within the Administration and which I think have been reasonably effective.", "I know Senator Kennedy suggested in his speech at Cleveland yesterday that that committee had not been particularly effective.", "I would only suggest that while we do not take the credit for it - I would not presume to - that since that committee has been formed the price line has been held very well within the United States.", " Well, I would say in the latter that the - and that's what I found uh - somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures uh - Mr. Nixon, that you used in your previous speech, when you talked about the Truman Administration.", "You - Mr. Truman came to office in nineteen uh - forty-four and at the end of the war, and uh - difficulties that were facing the United States during that period of transition - 1946 when price controls were lifted - so it's rather difficult to use an overall figure taking those seven and a half years and comparing them to the last eight years.", "I prefer to take the overall percentage record of the last twenty years of the Democrats and the eight years of the Republicans to show an overall period of growth.", "In regard to uh - price stability uh - I'm not aware that that committee did produce recommendations that ever were certainly before the Congress from the point of view of legislation in regard to controlling prices.", "In regard to the exchange of students and labor unions, I am chairman of the subcommittee on Africa and I think that one of the most unfortunate phases of our policy towards that country was the very minute number of exchanges that we had.", "I think it's true of Latin America also.", "We did come forward with a program of students for the Congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of Africa the previous year, so that I don't think that uh - we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor.", " That's correct.", " Well, because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh - then I think you would have complete uh - economic chaos.", "The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall.", "There are hundreds of thousands of them.", "They really don't - they're not able to control their market very well.", "They bring their crops in or their livestock in, many of them about the same time.", "They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs - a few large companies in many cases - and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place.", "I think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture.", "And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse.", "The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States.", "The automobile industry is the number one market for steel.", "So if the farmers' economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country.", "So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one.", "Secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance.", "The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh - surpluses - nine billion dollars worth.", "We've had a uh - higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years.", "I think that this farm policy has failed.", "In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance.", "And that can only be done through governmental action.", "I therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported, that the federal government, after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity, attempt to bring supply and demand into balance - attempt effective production controls - so that we won't have that five or six percent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent.", "I think Mr.Benson's program has failed.", "And I must say, after reading the Vice President's speech before the farmers, as he read mine, I don't believe that it's very much different from Mr. Benson's.", "I don't think it provides effective governmental controls.", "I think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years, which was Mr. Benson's theory.", "I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.", " I of course disagree with Senator Kennedy insofar as his suggestions as to what should be done uh - with re- on the farm program.", "He has made the suggestion that what we need is to move in the direction of more government controls, a suggestion that would also mean raising prices uh - that the consumers pay for products and im- and imposing upon the farmers uh - controls on acreage even far more than they have today.", "I think this is the wrong direction.", "I don't think this has worked in the past; I do not think it will work in the future.", "The program that I have advocated is one which departs from the present program that we have in this respect.", "It recognizes that the government has a responsibility to get the farmer out of the trouble he presently is in because the government got him into it.", "And that's the fundamental reason why we can't let the farmer go by himself at the present time.", "The farmer produced these surpluses because the government asked him to through legislation during the war.", "Now that we have these surpluses, it's our responsibility to indemnify the farmer during that period that we get rid of the farmer uh - the surpluses.", "Until we get the surpluses off the farmer's back, however, we should have a program such as I announced, which will see that farm income holds up.", "But I would propose holding that income up not through a type of program that Senator Kennedy has suggested that would raise prices, but one that would indemnify the farmer, pay the farmer in kind uh - from the products which are in surplus.", " Well, I would suggest, Mr. Vanocur, that uh - if you know the President, that was probably a facetious remark.", "Uh - I would also suggest that insofar as his statement is concerned, that I think it would be improper for the President of the United States to disclose uh - the instances in which members of his official family had made recommendations, as I have made them through the years to him, which he has accepted or rejected.", "The President has always maintained and very properly so that he is entitled to get what advice he wants from his cabinet and from his other advisers without disclosing that to anybody - including as a matter of fact the Congress.", "Now, I can only say this.", "Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council.", "I have been in the cabinet.", "I have met with the legislative leaders.", "I have met with the President when he made the great decisions with regard to Lebanon, Quemoy and Matsu, other matters.", "The President has asked for my advice.", "I have given it.", "Sometimes my advice has been taken.", "Sometimes it has not.", "I do not say that I have made the decisions.", "And I would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decisions, The president only makes the decisions.", "All that his advisers do is to give counsel when he asks for it.", "As far as what experience counts and whether that is experience that counts, that isn't for me to say.", "Uh - I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider; Senator Kennedy's is there for the people to consider.", "As he pointed out, we came to the Congress in the same year.", "His experience has been different from mine.", "Mine has been in the executive branch.", "His has been in the legislative branch.", "I would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and I think both he and I are going to abide by whatever the people decide.", " Well, I'll just say that the question is of experience and the question also is uh - what our judgment is of the future, and what our goals are for the United States, and what ability we have to implement those goals.", "Abraham Lincoln came to the presidency in 1860 after a rather little known uh - session in the House of Representatives and after being defeated for the Senate in fifty-eight and was a distinguished president.", "There's no certain road to the presidency.", "There are no guarantees that uh - if you take uh - one road or another that you will be a successful president.", "I have been in the Congress for fourteen years.", "I have voted in the last uh - eight years uh - and the Vice President was uh - presiding over the Senate and meeting his other responsibilities.", "I have met met uh - decisions over eight hundred times on matters which affect not only the domestic security of the United States, but as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.", "The question really is: which candidate and which party can meet the problems that the United States is going to face in the sixties?", " I didn't indicate.", "I did not advocate reducing the federal debt because I don't believe that you're going to be able to reduce the federal debt very much in nineteen sixty-one, two, or three.", "I think you have heavy obligations which affect our security, which we're going to have to meet.", "And therefore I've never suggested we should uh - be able to retire the debt substantially, or even at all in nineteen sixty-one or two.", " No, never.", " No.", "No.", "Not reducing the interest -", " - reducing the interest rate.", "In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960.", "What I have talked about, however, the kind of programs that I've talked about, in my judgment, are uh - fiscally sound.", "Medical care for the aged, I would put under social security.", "The Vice President and I disagree on this.", "The program - the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon- Javits program - would have cost, if fully used uh - six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state.", "The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security, and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax.", "Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers' salaries.", "I think that's a good investment.", "I think we're going to have to do it.", "And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated.", "There is no greater return to an economy or to a society than an educational system second to none.", "On the question of the development of natural resources, I would pay as you go in the sense that they would be balanced and the power revenues would bring back sufficient money to finance the projects, in the same way as the Tennessee Valley.", "I believe in the balanced budget.", "And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession.", "Otherwise, with a steady rate of economic growth - and Mr. Nixon and Mr. Rockefeller, in their meeting, said a five per cent economic growth would bring by 1962 ten billion dollars extra in tax revenues.", "Whatever is brought in, I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget, if business remains orderly.", " Yes.", "I think what Mr. Novins was referring to was not one of Senator Kennedy's speeches, but the Democratic platform, which did mention cutting the national debt.", "I think, too, that it should be pointed out that of course it is not possible, particularly under the proposals that Senator Kennedy has advocated, either to cut the national debt or to reduce taxes.", "As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes.", "As Senator Kennedy points out that as far as his one proposal is concerned - the one for medical care for the aged - that that would be financed out of Social Security.", "That, however, is raising taxes for those who pay Social Security.", "He points out that he would make pay-as-you-go be the basis for our natural resources development.", "Where our natural resources development - which I also support, incidentally, however - whenever you uh - uh - in - in - uh - appropriates money for one of these projects, you have to pay now and appropriate the money and the eh- while they eventually do pay out, it doesn't mean that you - the government doesn't have to put out the money this year.", "And so I would say that in all of these proposals Senator Kennedy has made, they will result in one of two things: either he has to raise taxes or he has to unbalance the budget.", "If he unbalances the budget, that means you have inflation, and that will be, of course, a very cruel blow to the very people - the older people - that we've been talking about.", "As far as aid for school construction is concerned, I favor that, as Senator Kennedy did, in January of this year, when he said he favored that rather than aid to s- teacher salaries.", "I favor that because I believe that's the best way to aid our schools without running any risk whatever of the federal government telling our teachers what to teach.", " I'm awfully glad you ge- got that question because as you know I got into it at the last of my other question and wasn't able to complete the argument.", "Uh - I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh - pay teachers' salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers' salaries - at least that's the way I read his remarks.", "Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers' salaries?", "Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then?", "Why do I take it now?", "We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers' salaries.", "We need higher teachers' salaries.", "But we also want our education to be free of federal control.", "When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach.", "I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession.", "There is another point that should be made.", "I favor higher salaries for teachers.", "But, as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference, the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction, which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers' salaries.", "I should also point out this; once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers' salaries, your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should.", "I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility.", "Teachers' salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries.", " it should be more.", "But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program.", "My objection here is not the cost in dollars.", "My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have.", " When uh - the Vice President quotes me in January, sixty, I do not believe the federal government should pay directly teachers' salaries, but that was not the issue before the Senate in February.", "The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state.", "The state then could determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher salaries.", "On that question the Vice President and I disagreed.", "I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly, because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I disagreed, and his tie vote uh - defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal.", "I don't want the federal government paying teachers' salaries directly.", "But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers' salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee.", "And therefore I think that was a sound proposal and that is why I supported it and I regret that it did not pass.", "Secondly, there have been statements made that uh - the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget.", "That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars.", "That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record.", "My view is that you can do these programs - and they should be carefully drawn - within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead.", " Well as you take the bills -", " If I may take the bills, we did pass in the Senate a bill uh - to provide a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage.", "It failed because the House did not pass it and the House failed by eleven votes.", "And I might say that two-thirds of the Republicans in the House voted against a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage and a majority of the Democrats sustained it - nearly two-thirds of them voted for the dollar twenty-five.", "We were threatened by a veto if we passed a dollar and a quarter - it's extremely difficult with the great power that the president does to pass any bill when the president is opposed to it.", "All the president needs to sustain his veto of any bill is one-third plus one in either the House or the Senate.", "Secondly, we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate.", "It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives.", "It was killed in the Rules Committee.", "And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House.", "Four Democrats voted for it.", "Every Republican on the Rules Committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the House of Representatives.", "Thirdly, on medical care for the aged, this is the same fight that's been going on for twenty-five years in Social Security.", "We wanted to tie it to Social Security.", "We offered an amendment to do so.", "Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it.", "And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it.", "In my judgment, a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs.", "But if you send a Republican president and a Democratic majority and the threat of a veto hangs over the Congress, in my judgment you will continue what happened in the August session, which is a clash of parties and inaction.", " Well obviously my views are a little different.", "First of all, I don't see how it's possible for a one-third of a body, such as the Republicans have in the House and the Senate to stop two-thirds, if the two-thirds are adequately led.", "I would say, too, that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans.", "It would seem to me again that it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the eight Democrats' not getting a something through that particular committee.", "I would say further that to blame the President in his veto power for the inability of the Senator and his colleagues to get action in this special session uh - misses the mark.", "When the president exercises his veto power, he has to have the people upo- behind him, not just a third of the Congress.", "Because let's consider it.", "If the majority of the members of the Congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues - the majority of those who were Democrats - why didn't they pass them and send to the President and get a veto and have an issue?", "The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them; it was because the people were against them.", "It was because they were too extreme.", "And I am convinced that the alternate proposals that I have, that the Republicans have in the field of health, in the field of education, in the field of welfare, because they are not extreme, because they will accomplish the end uh - without too great cost in dollars or in freedom, that they could get through the next Congress.", " I would say this: that we, of course, expect to pick up some seats in both in the House and the Senate.", "Uh - We would hope to control the House, to get a majority in the House uh - in this election.", "We cannot, of course, control the Senate.", "I would say that a president will be able to lead - a president will be able to get his program through - to the effect that he has the support of the country, the support of the people.", "Sometimes we - we get the opinion that in getting programs through the House or the Senate it's purely a question of legislative finagling and all that sort of thing.", "It isn't really that.", "Whenever a majority of the people are for a program, the House and the Senate responds to it.", "And whether this House and Senate, in the next session is Democratic or Republican, if the country will have voted for the candidate for the presidency and for the proposals that he has made, I believe that you will find that the president, if it were a Republican, as it would be in my case, would be able to get his program through that Congress.", "Now, I also say that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, that, again, the question is not simply one of uh - a presidential veto stopping programs.", "You must always remember that a president can't stop anything unless he has the people behind him.", "And the reason President Eisenhower's vetoes have been sustained - the reason the Congress does not send up bills to him which they think will be vetoed - is because the people and the Congress, the majority of them, know the country is behind the President.", " Well, now let's look at these bills that the Vice President suggests were too extreme.", "One was a bill for a dollar twenty-five cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business.", "I don't think that's extreme at all; and yet nearly two-thirds to three-fourths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against that proposal.", "Secondly was the federal aid to education bill.", "It - it was a very uh - because of the defeat of teacher salaries, it was not a bill that uh - met in my opinion the need.", "The fact of the matter is it was a bill that was less than you recommended, Mr. Nixon, this morning in your proposal.", "It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House - not one Republican - and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it.", "I don't say the Democrats are united in their support of the program.", "But I do say a majority are.", "And I say a majority of the Republicans are opposed to it.", "The third is medical care for the aged which is tied to Social Security, which is financed out of Social Security funds.", "It does not put a deficit on the Treasury.", "The proposal advanced by you and by Mr. Javits would have cost six hundred millions of dollars - Mr. Rockefeller rejected it in New York, said he didn't agree with the financing at all, said it ought to be on Social Security.", "So these are three programs which are quite moderate.", "I think it shows the difference between the two parties.", "One party is ready to move in these programs.", "The other party gives them lip service.", " Well, I think they're serious.", "I think it's a matter that we should continue to uh - give uh - great care and attention to.", "We should support uh - the laws which the United States has passed in order to protect us from uh - those who would destroy us from within.", "We should sustain uh - the Department of Justice in its efforts and the F.B.I., and we should be continually alert.", "I think if the United States is maintaining a strong society here in the United States, I think that we can meet any internal threat.", "The major threat is external and will continue.", " I agree with Senator Kennedy's appraisal generally in this respect.", "The question of Communism within the United States has been one that has worried us in the past.", "It is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come.", "We have to remember that the cold war that Mr. Khrushchev is waging and his colleagues are waging, is waged all over the world and it's waged right here in the United States.", "That's why we have to continue to be alert.", "It is also essential in being alert that we be fair; fair because by being fair we uphold the very freedoms that the Communists would destroy.", "We uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow.", "And, in this connection, I think that uh - we must look to the future having in mind the fact that we fight Communism at home not only by our laws to deal with Communists uh - the few who do become Communists and the few who do become tra- fellow travelers, but we also fight Communism at home by moving against those various injustices which exist in our society which the Communists feed upon.", "And in that connection I again would say that while Senator Kennedy says we are for the status quo, I do believe that he uh - would agree that I am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education, my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his.", "The question again is not one of goals - we're for those goals - it's one of means.", " Not at all.", "As a matter of fact your question brings out a point that I am very glad to make.", "Too often in appraising whether we are moving ahead or not we think only of what the federal government is doing.", "Now that isn't the test of whether America moves.", "The test of whether America moves is whether the federal government, plus the state government, plus the local government, plus the biggest segment of all - individual enterprise - moves.", "We have for example a gross national product of approximately five hundred billion dollars.", "Roughly a hundred billion to a hundred and a quarter billion of that is the result of government activity.", "Four hundred billion, approximately, is a result of what individuals do.", "Now, the reason the Eisenhower Administration has moved, the reason that we've had the funds, for example, locally to build the schools, and the hospitals, and the highways, to make the progress that we have, is because this Administration has encouraged individual enterprise; and it has resulted in the greatest expansion of the private sector of the economy that has ever been witnessed in an eight-year period.", "And that is growth.", "That is the growth that we are looking for; it is the growth that this Administration has supported and that its policies have stimulated.", " Well, I must say that the reason that the schools have been constructed is because the local school districts were willing to increase the property taxes to a tremendously high figure - in my opinion, almost to the point of diminishing returns in order to sustain these schools.", "Secondly, I think we have a rich uh - country.", "And I think we have a powerful country.", "I think what we have to do, however, is have the president and the leadership set before our country exactly what we must do in the next decade, if we're going to maintain our security in education, in economic growth, in development of natural resources.", "The Soviet Union is making great gains.", "It isn't enough to compare what might have been done eight years ago, or ten years ago, or fifteen years ago, or twenty years ago.", "I want to compare what we're doing with what our adversaries are doing, so that by the year 1970 the United States is ahead in education, in health, in building, in homes, in economic strength.", "I think that's the big assignment, the big task, the big function of the federal government.", " Thank you, Mr. Smith.", "Senator Kennedy.", "First of all, I think it is well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the Soviet Union in this whole matter of growth.", "The Soviet Union has been moving faster than we have.", "But the reason for that is obvious.", "They start from a much lower base.", "Although they have been moving faster in growth than we have, we find, for example, today that their total gross national product is only forty-four per cent of our total gross national product.", "That's the same percentage that it was twenty years ago.", "And as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago.", "Is this any reason for complacency?", "Not at all Because these are determined men.", "They are fanatical men.", "And we have to get the very most of uh - out uh - out of our economy.", "I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score.", "Where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy.", "I respectfully submit that Senator Kennedy too often would rely too much on the federal government, on what it would do to solve our problems, to stimulate growth.", "I believe that when we examine the Democratic platform, when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight, when we compare them with the proposals that I have made, that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that I have advocated.", "There are many of the points that he has made that I would like to comment upon.", "The one in the field of health is worth mentioning.", "Our health program - the one that Senator Javits and other Republican Senators, as well as I supported - is one that provides for all people over sixty-five who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it.", "It provides a choice of having either government insurance or private insurance.", "But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it.", "His program under Social Security, would require everybody who had Social Security to take government health insurance whether he wanted it or not.", "And it would not cover several million people who are not covered by Social Security at all.", "Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his.", "The other point that I would make is this: this downgrading of how much things cost I think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when - during the Truman Administration when the government was spending more than it took in - we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation.", "We found the people who could least afford it - people on retired incomes uh - people on fixed incomes - we found them unable to meet their bills at the end of the month.", "It is essential that a man who's president of this country certainly stand for every program that will mean for growth.", "And I stand for programs that will mean growth and progress.", "But it is also essential that he not allow a dollar spent that could be better spent by the people themselves.", " The point was made by Mr. Nixon that the Soviet production is only forty-four percent of ours.", "I must say that forty-four percent and that Soviet country is causing us a good deal of trouble tonight.", "I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship.", "I don't want to see the day when it's sixty percent of ours, and seventy and seventy-five and eighty and ninety percent of ours, with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction.", "Secondly, the Vice President mentioned medical care for the aged.", "Our program was an amendment to the Kerr bill.", "The Kerr bill provided assistance to all those who were not on Social Security.", "I think it's a very clear contrast.", "In 1935, when the Social Security Act was written, ninety-four out of ninety-five Republicans voted against it.", "Mr. Landon ran in 1936 to repeal it.", "In August of 1960, when we tried to get it again, but this time for medical care, we received the support of one Republican in the Senate on this occasion.", "Thirdly, I think the question before the American people is: as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them, the goals are the same for all Americans.", "The means are at question.", "The means are at issue.", "If you feel that everything that is being done now is satisfactory, that the relative power and prestige and strength of the United States is increasing in relation to that of the Communists; that we've b- gaining more security, that we are achieving everything as a nation that we should achieve, that we are achieving a better life for our citizens and greater strength, then I agree.", "I think you should vote for Mr. Nixon.", "But if you feel that we have to move again in the sixties, that the function of the president is to set before the people the unfinished business of our society as Franklin Roosevelt did in the thirties, the agenda for our people - what we must do as a society to meet our needs in this country and protect our security and help the cause of freedom.", "As I said at the beginning, the question before us all, that faces all Republicans and all Democrats, is: can freedom in the next generation conquer, or are the Communists going to be successful?", "That's the great issue.", "And if we meet our responsibilities I think freedom will conquer.", "If we fail, if we fail to move ahead, if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country, then I think that uh - the tide could begin to run against us.", "And I don't want historians, ten years from now, to say, these were the years when the tide ran out for the United States.", "I want them to say these were the years when the tide came in; these were the years when the United States started to move again.", "That's the question before the American people, and only you can decide what you want, what you want this country to be, what you want to do with the future.", "I think we're ready to move.", "And it is to that great task, if we're successful, that we will address ourselves.", " What is was, it was a tragedy, Martha.", "It -- Chris Stevens was one of our best.", "We lost three other brave Americans.", "I can make absolutely two commitments to you and all the American people tonight.", "One, we will find and bring to justice the men who did this.", "And secondly, we will get to the bottom of it, and whatever -- wherever the facts lead us, wherever they lead us, we will make clear to the American public, because whatever mistakes were made will not be made again.", "When you're looking at a president, Martha, it seems to me that you should take a look at his most important responsibility.", "That's caring for the national security of the country.", "And the best way to do that is take a look at how he's handled the issues of the day.", "On Iraq, the president said he would end the war.", "Governor Romney said that was a tragic

called Bashar Assad a reformer.", "And...", " ... we should not have -- we should not have waited to Russia...", " ... should not have waited for Russia to give us the green light at the U.N. to do something about it.", " Russia...", " They're -- they're still arming the man.", "Iran is flying flights over Iraq...", " And the opposition is being armed.", " ... to help Bashar Assad.", "And, by the way, if we had the status-of-forces agreement that the vice president said he would bet his vice presidency on in Iraq, we probably would have been able to prevent that.", "But he failed to achieve that, as well, again.", " I don't...", " Yeah.", " In Syria?", " What is in the national interests of the American people.", " What is in the national security of the American people.", "It's got to be in the strategic national interests of our country.", " Each situation will -- will come up with its own set of circumstances, but putting American troops on the ground?", "That's got to be within the national security interests of the American people.", " That means like embargoes and sanctions and overflights, those are things that don't put American troops on the ground.", "But if you're talking about putting American troops on the ground, only in our national security interests.", " Sure.", " I don't see how a person can separate their public life from their private life or from their faith.", "Our faith informs us in everything we do.", "My faith informs me about how to take care of the vulnerable, of how to make sure that people have a chance in life.", " Now, you want to ask basically why I'm pro-life?", "It's not simply because of my Catholic faith.", "That's a factor, of course.", "But it's also because of reason and science.", "You know, I think about 10 1/2 years ago, my wife Janna and I went to Mercy Hospital in Janesville where I was born, for our seven week ultrasound for our firstborn child, and we saw that heartbeat.", "A little baby was in the shape of a bean.", "And to this day, we have nicknamed our firstborn child Liza, \"Bean.\"", "Now I believe that life begins at conception.", "That's why -- those are the reasons why I'm pro-life.", "Now I understand this is a difficult issue, and I respect people who don't agree with me on this, but the policy of a Romney administration will be to oppose abortions with the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.", "What troubles me more is how this administration has handled all of these issues.", "Look at what they're doing through Obamacare with respect to assaulting the religious liberties of this country.", "They're infringing upon our first freedom, the freedom of religion, by infringing on Catholic charities, Catholic churches, Catholic hospitals.", "Our church should not have to sue our federal government to maintain their religious liberties.", "And with respect to abortion, the Democratic Party used to say they wanted it to be safe, legal and rare.", "Now they support it without restriction and with taxpayer funding.", "Taxpayer funding in Obamacare, taxpayer funding with foreign aid.", "The vice president himself went to China and said that he sympathized and wouldn't second guess their one child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations.", "That to me is pretty extreme.", " My religion defines who I am, and I've been a practicing Catholic my whole life.", "And has particularly informed my social doctrine.", "The Catholic social doctrine talks about taking care of those who -- who can't take care of themselves, people who need help.", "With regard to -- with regard to abortion, I accept my church's position on abortion as a -- what we call a (inaudible) doctrine.", "Life begins at conception in the church's judgment.", "I accept it in my personal life.", "But I refuse to impose it on equally devout Christians and Muslims and Jews, and I just refuse to impose that on others, unlike my friend here, the -- the congressman.", "I -- I do not believe that we have a right to tell other people that -- women they can't control their body.", "It's a decision between them and their doctor.", "In my view and the Supreme Court, I'm not going to interfere with that.", "With regard to the assault on the Catholic church, let me make it absolutely clear, no religious institution, Catholic or otherwise, including Catholic Social Services, Georgetown Hospital, Mercy Hospital, any hospital, none has to either refer contraception, none has to pay for contraception, none has to be a vehicle to get contraception in any insurance policy they provide.", "That is a fact.", "That is a fact.", "Now with regard to the way in which the -- we differ, my friend says that he -- well I guess he accepts Governor Romney's position now, because in the past he has argued that there was -- there's rape and forcible rape.", "He's argued that in the case of rape or incest, it was still -- it would be a crime to engage in having an abortion.", "I just fundamentally disagree with my friend.", " All I'm saying is, if you believe that life begins at conception, that, therefore, doesn't change the definition of life.", "That's a principle.", "The policy of a Romney administration is to oppose abortion with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.", "Now, I've got to take issue with the Catholic church and religious liberty.", " You have on the issue... (CROSSTALK)", " ... why would they keep -- why would they keep suing you?", "It's a distinction without a difference.", " We don't think that unelected judges should make this decision; that people through their elected representatives in reaching a consensus in society through the democratic process should make this determination.", " The court -- the next president will get one or two Supreme Court nominees.", "That's how close Roe v. Wade is.", "Just ask yourself, with Robert Bork being the chief adviser on the court for -- for Mr. Romney, who do you think he's likely to appoint?", "Do you think he's likely to appoint someone like Scalia or someone else on the court far right that would outlaw (inaudible) -- outlaw abortion?", "I suspect that would happen.", "I guarantee you, that will not happen.", "We picked two people.", "We pick people who are open-minded.", "They've been good justices.", "So keep an eye on the Supreme Court...", " Was there a litmus test on them?", " There was no litmus test.", "We picked people who had an open mind; did not come with an agenda.", " I would say to him the same thing I say to my son who did serve a year in Iraq, that we only have one truly sacred obligation as a government.", "That's to equip those we send into harm's way and care for those who come home.", "That's the only sacred obligation we have.", "Everything else falls behind that.", "I would also tell him that the fact that he, this decorated soldier you talked about, fought for his country, that that should be honored.", "He should not be thrown into a category of a 47 percent who don't pay their taxes while he was out there fighting and not having to pay taxes, and somehow not taking responsibility.", "I would also tell him that there are things that have occurred in this campaign and occur in every campaign that I'm sure both of us regret anyone having said, particularly in these -- these special new groups that can go out there, raise all the money they want, not have to identify themselves, who say the most scurrilous things about the other candidate.", "It's -- it's an abomination.", "But the bottom line here is I'd ask that hero you referenced to take a look at whether or not Governor Romney or President Obama has the conviction to help lift up the middle class, restore them to where they were before this great recession hit and they got wiped out.", "Or whether or not he's going to continue to focus on taking care of only the very wealthy, not asking them to make -- pay any part of the deal to bring -- bring back the middle class and the economy of this country.", "I'd ask him to take a look at whether the president of the United States has acted wisely in the use of force and whether or not the slipshod comments being made by my -- my -- or by Governor Romney serve -- serve our interests very well.", "But there are things that have been said in campaigns that I -- I find not very appealing.", " First of all, I'd thank him to his service to our country.", "Second of all, I'd say we are not going to impose these devastating cuts on our military which compromises their mission and their safety.", "And then I would say, you have a president who ran for president four years ago promising hope and change, who has now turned his campaign into attack, blame and defame.", "You see, if you don't have a good record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone to run from.", "That was what President Obama said in 2008.", "It's what he's doing right now.", "Look at all the string of broken promises.", "If you like your health care plan, you can keep it.", "Try telling that to the 20 million people who are projected to lose their health insurance if Obamacare goes through or the 7-point million -- 7.4 million seniors who are going to lose it.", "Or remember when he said this: I guarantee if you make less than $250,000, your taxes won't go up.", "Of the 21 tax increases in Obamacare, 12 of them hit the middle class.", "Or remember when he said health insurance premiums will go down $2,500 per family, per year?", "They've gone up $3,000, and they're expected to go up another $2,400.", "Or remember when he said, \"I promise by the end of my first term I'll cut the deficit in half in four years\"?", "We've had four budgets, four trillion-dollar deficits.", "A debt crisis is coming.", "We can't keep spending and borrowing like this.", "We can't

a speech.", "We asked his budget office, \"Can we see the plan?\"", "They sent us to the press secretary.", "He gave us a copy of the speech.", "We asked the Congressional Budget Office, \"Tell us

president?", "He broke his big promise to bring people together to solve the country's biggest problems.", "And what I would tell him is we don't have to settle for this.", " Martha?", " We can do better than this.", " I hope I'll get equal time.", " The two budgets the congressman introduced have eviscerated all the things that the middle class cares about.", "It is (inaudible) he will knock 19 million people off of Medicare.", "It will kick 200,000 children off of early education.", "It will eliminate the tax credit people have to be able to send their children to college.", "It cuts education by $450 billion.", "It does -- it does virtually nothing except continue to increase the tax cuts for the very wealthy.", "And, you know, we've had enough of this.", "The idea that he's so

use our prosperity to enrich not just the few, but all of our families?", "I believe we have to make the right and responsible choices.", "If I'm entrusted with the presidency, here are the choices that I will make.", "I will balance the budget every year.", "I will pay down the national debt.", "I will put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox and protect them.", "And I will cut taxes for middle-class families.", "I believe it's important to resist the temptation to squander our surplus.", "If we make the right choices, we can have a prosperity that endures and enriches all of our people.", "If I'm entrusted with the presidency, I will help parents and strengthen families because, you know, if we have prosperity that grows and grows, we still won't be successful unless we strengthen families by, for example, ensuring that children can always go to schools that are safe.", "By giving parents the tools to protect their children against cultural pollution.", "I will make sure that we invest in our country and our families.", "And I mean investing in education, health care, the environment, and middle-class tax cuts and retirement security.", "That is my agenda and

to set agendas.", "I think you'll find the difference reflected in our budgets.", "I want to take one-half of the surplus and dedicate it to Social Security.", "One-quarter of the surplus for important projects, and I want to send one-quarter of the surplus back to the people who pay the bills.", "I want everybody who pays taxes to have their tax rates cut.", "And that stands in contrast to my worthy opponent's plan, which will increase the size of government dramatically.", "His plan is three times larger than President Clinton's proposed plan eight years ago.", "It is a plan that will have 200 new programs -- expanded programs and creates 20,000 new bureaucrats.", "It it empowers Washington.", "Tonight you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to hear that my passion and my vision is to empower Americans to be able to make decisions for themselves in their own lives.", " Yes, Jim.", "I said that his tax cut plan, for example, raises the question of whether it's the right choice for the country.", "And let me give you an example of what I mean.", "Under Governor Bush's tax cut proposal, he would spend more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of the new spending that he proposes for education, health care, prescription drugs and national defense all combined.", "Now, I think those are the wrong priorities.", "Now, under my proposal, for every dollar that I propose in spending for things like education and health care, I will put another dollar into middle class tax cuts.", "And for every dollar that I spend in those two categories, I'll put $2 toward paying down the national debt.", "I think it's very important to keep the debt going down and completely eliminate it.", "And I also think it's very important to go to the next stage of welfare reform.", "Our country has cut the welfare rolls in half.", "I fought hard from my days in the Senate and as vice president to cut the welfare rolls and we've moved millions of people in America into good jobs.", "But it's now time for the next stage of welfare reform, and include fathers and not only mothers.", " Let me just say that obviously tonight we're going to hear some phony numbers about what I think and what we ought to do.", "People need to know that over the next ten years it is going to be $25 trillion of revenue that comes into our treasurey and we anticipate spending $21 trillion.", "And my plan say why don't we pass 1.3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills?", "Surely we can afford 5% of the $25 trillion that are coming into the treasury to the hard working people that pay the bills.", "There is a difference of opinion.", "My opponent thinks the government -- the surplus is the government's money.", "That's not what I think.", "I think it's the hard-working people of America's money and I want to share some of that money with you so you have more money to build and save and dream for your families.", "It's a difference of opinion.", "It's a difference between government making decisions for you and you getting more of your money to make decisions for yourself.", " Yes.", "I take him for his word.", "Look, I fully recognize I'm not of Washington.", "I'm from Texas.", "And he's got a lot of experience, but so do I.", "And I've been the chief executive officer of the second biggest state in the union.", "I have a proud record of working with both Republicans and Democrats, which is what our nation needs.", "Somebody that can come to Washington and say let's forget all the finger pointing and get positive things done on Medicare, prescription drugs, Social Security, and so I take him for his word.", " Jim, if I could just respond.", "I know that.", "The governor used the phrase phony numbers, but if you look at the plan and add the numbers up, these numbers are correct.", "He spends more money for tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of his new spending proposals for health care, prescription drugs, education and national defense all combined.", "I agree that the surplus is the American people's money, it's your money.", "That's why I don't think we should give nearly half of it to the wealthiest 1%, because the other 99% have had an awful lot to do with building the surplus in our prosperity.", " I hope it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about wealthy people.", " Actually what I've said, Jim.", "I've said that eight years ago they campaigned on prescription drugs for seniors.", "And four years ago they campaigned on getting prescription drugs for seniors.", "And now they're campaigning on getting prescription drugs for seniors.", "It seems like they can't get it done.", "Now, they may blame other folks, but it's time to get somebody in Washington who is going to work with both Republicans and Democrats to get some positive things done when it comes to our seniors.", "And so what I've said is that there's been some missed opportunities.", "They've had a chance.", "They've had a chance to form consensus.", "I've got a plan on Medicare, for example, that's a two-stage plan that says we'll have immediate help for seniors and what I call immediate Helping Hand, a $48 billion program.", "But I also want to say to seniors, if you're happy with Medicare the way it is, fine, you can stay in the program.", "But we're going to give you additional choices like they give federal employees in the federal employee health plan.", "They have a variety of choices to choose, so should seniors.", "And my point has been, as opposed to politicizing an issue like Medicare, in other words, holding it up as an issue, hoping somebody bites it and try to clobber them over the head with it for political purposes, this year, in the year 2000, it's time to get it done once and for all.", "That's what I've been critical about the administration for.", "Same with Social Security.", "I think there was a good opportunity to bring Republicans and Democrats together to reform the Social Security system so seniors will never go without.", "Those on Social Security today will have their promise made, but also to give younger workers the option at their choice of being able to manage some of their own money in the private sector to make sure there's a Social Security system around tomorrow.", "There are a lot of young workers at our rallies we go to that when they hear I'll trust them at their option to be able to manage, under certain guidelines, some of their own money to get a better rate of return so that they'll have a retirement plan in the future, they begin to nod their heads and they want a different attitude in Washington.", " Well, Jim, under my plan all seniors will get prescription drugs under Medicare.", "The governor has described Medicare as a government HMO.", "It's not, and let me explain the difference.", "Under the Medicare prescription drug proposal I'm making, here is how it works, you go to your own doctor.", "Your doctor chooses your prescription.", "No HMO or insurance company can take those choices away from you.", "Then you go to your own pharmacy.", "You fill the prescription and Medicare pays half the cost.", "If you're in a very poor family or if you have very high costs, Medicare will pay all the costs, a $25 premium, and much better benefits than you can possibly find in the private sector.", "Now here is the contrast.", "95% of all seniors would get no help whatsoever under my opponent's plan for the first four or five years.", "Now, one thing I don't understand, Jim, is why is it that the wealthiest 1% get their tax cuts the first year, but 95% of seniors have to wait four to five years before they get a single penny?", " I guess my answer to that is the man is running on Medi-scare.", "Trying to frighten people in the voting booth.", "It's just not the way I think and it's not my intentions and not my plan.", "I want all seniors to have prescription drugs in Medicare.", "We need to reform Medicare.", "There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been opportunity to do so but this administration has failed to do it.", "And so seniors will have not only a Medicare plan where the poor seniors will have prescription drugs paid for, but there will be a variety of options.", "The current system today has meant a lot for a lot of seniors, and I really appreciate the intentions of the current system as I mentioned.", "If you're happy with the system you can stay in it.", "But there are a lot of procedures that haven't kept up in Medicare with the current times.", "No prescription drug benefits, no drug therapy, no preventative medicines, no vision care.", "We need to have a modern system to help seniors, and the idea of supporting a federally controlled 132,000-page document bureaucracy as being a compassionate way for seniors, and the only compassionate source of care for seniors is not my vision.", "I believe we ought to give seniors more options.", "I believe we ought to make the system work better.", "I know this.", "I know it will require a different kind of leader to go to Washington to say to both Republicans and Democrats, let's come together.", "You've had your chance, Vice President, you've been there for eight years and nothing has been done.", "My point is, is that my plan not only trusts seniors with options, my plan sets aside $3.4 trillion for Medicare over the next ten years.", "My plan also says it requires a new approach in Washington, D.C.", "It's going to require somebody who can work across the partisan divide.", " If I could respond to that.", "Under my plan I will put Medicare in an iron clad lockbox and prevent the money from being used for anything other than Medicare.", "The governor has declined to endorse that idea even though the Republican as well as Democratic leaders in Congress have endorsed it.", "I would be interested to see if he would say this evening he'll put Medicare in a lockbox.", "I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think he will because under his plan if you work out the numbers \u00c2 $100 billion comes out of Medicare just for the wealthiest 1% in the tax cut.", "Now here is the difference.", "Some people who say the word reform actually mean cuts.", "Under the governor's plan, if you kept the same fee for service that you have now under Medicare, your premiums would go up by between 18% and 47%, and that is the study of the Congressional plan that he's modeled his proposal on by the Medicare actuaries.", "Let me give you one quick example.", "There is a man here tonight named George McKinney from Milwaukee.", "He's 70 years old, has high blood pressure, his wife has heart trouble.", "They have an income of $25,000 a year.", "They can't pay for their prescription drugs and so they're some of the ones that go to Canada regularly in order to get their prescription drugs.", "Under my plan, half of their costs would be paid right away.", "Under Governor Bush's plan, they would get not one penny for four to five years and then they would be forced to go into an HMO or to an insurance company and ask them for coverage, but there would be no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the terms and conditions.", " I cannot let this go by, the old-style Washington politics, of we're going to scare you in the voting booth.", "Under my plan the man gets immediate help with prescription drugs.", "It's called Immediate Helping Hand.", "Instead of squabbling and finger pointing, he gets immediate help.", "Let me say something.", " Can I make another point?", "They get $25,000 a year income, that makes them ineligible.", " Look, this is a man who has great numbers.", "He talks about numbers.", "I'm beginning to think not only did he invent the Internet, but he invented the calculator.", "It's fuzzy math.", "It's a scaring -- he's trying to scare people in the voting booth.", "Under my tax plan that he continues to criticize, I set one-third.", "The federal government should take no more than a third of anybody's check.", "But I also dropped the bottom rate from 15% to 10%.", "Because by far the vast majority of the help goes to people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.", "If you're a family of four in Massachusetts, making $50,000, you get a 50% cut in the federal income taxes you pay.", "It's from $4000 to about $2000.", "Now, the difference in our plans is I want that $2,000 to go to you, and the vice president would like to be spending the $2,000 on your behalf.", " It's just clear you can go to the website and look.", "If you make more than $25,000 a year you don't get a penny of help under the Bush prescription drug proposal for at least four to five years, and then you're pushed into a Medicare -- into an HMO or insurance company plan, and there's no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the conditions.", "And the insurance companies say it won't work and they won't offer these plans.", " Correct.", " Correct.", " The difference is I want to bring it to 100% and he wants to bring it to 5%.", " That's totally false for him to stand up here and say that.", "Let me make sure the seniors hear me loud and clear.", "They have had their chance to get something done.", "I'm going to work with Democrats and Republicans to reform the system.", "All seniors will be covered, all poor seniors will have their prescription drugs paid for, and in the meantime, we'll have a plan to help poor seniors and in the meantime it could be one year or two years.", " Let me call your attention to the key word there.", "He said all poor seniors.", " Wait a minute.", "All seniors are covered under prescription drugs in my plan.", " In the first year?", " If we can get it done in the first year, you bet.", "Yours is phased in in eight years.", " It's a two-phase plan.", "For the first four years -- it takes a year to pass it and for the first four years only the poor are covered.", "Middle class seniors like George McKinney and his wife are not covered for four to five years.", " Excellent question.", "And here is the simple difference.", "My plan has not only a short-term component, but also a long-term component.", "And it focuses not only on increasing the supply, which I think we have to do, but also on working on the consumption side.", "Now, in the short-term we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price from OPEC when they want to raise the price.", "And in the long-term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy.", "And domestic sources that are cleaner and better.", "And I'm proposing a plan that will give tax credits and tax incentives for the rapid development of new kinds of cars and trucks and buses and factories and boilers and furnaces that don't have as much pollution, that don't burn as much energy, and that help us get out on the cutting edge of the new technologies that will create millions of new jobs.", "Because, when we sell these new products here, we'll then be able to sell them overseas.", "There is a ravenous demand for them overseas.", "Now, another big difference is Governor Bush is proposing to open up some of our most precious environmental treasures, like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for the big oil companies to go in and start producing oil there.", "I think that is the wrong choice.", "It would only give us a few months' worth of oil and the oil wouldn't start flowing for many years into the future.", "I don't think it's a fair price to pay to destroy precious parts of America's environment.", "We have to bet on the future and move beyond the current technologies to have a whole new generation of more efficient, cleaner, energy technology.", " It's an issue I know a lot about.", "I was a small oil person for a while in west Texas.", "This is an administration that's had no plan.", "And all of a sudden the results of having no plan have caught up with America.", "First and foremost we have to fully fund LIHEAP which is a way to help low income folks, particularly here in the east to pay for high fuel bills.", "Secondly, we need an active exploration program in America.", "The only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home.", "You bet I want to open up a small part of Alaska.", "When that field is online it will produce one million barrels a day.", "Today we import one million barrels from Saddam Hussein.", "I would rather that a million come from our own hemisphere, our own country as opposed to Saddam Hussein.", "I want to build more pipelines to move natural gas throughout this hemisphere.", "I want to develop the coal resources in America.", "Have clean coal technologies.", "We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got abundant supplies of energy here in America and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d better get after it, we better start exploring it or otherwise we'll be in deep trouble in the future because of our dependency upon foreign sources of crude.", " Let me clarify.", "I'm for doing something both on the supply side and production side and on the consumption side.", "Let me say, that I found one thing in Governor Bush's answer that we certainly agree on, and that's the low income heating assistance program.", "I commend you for supporting that.", "I worked to get $400 million just a couple of weeks ago.", "And to establish a permanent home heating oil reserve here in the northeast.", "Now, as for the proposals that I've worked for for renewables and conservation and efficiencies and new technologies.", "The fact is for the last few years in the Congress, we've faced a lot of opposition to them.", "They've only approved about 10% of the agenda I've helped to send up there.", "I think we need to get serious about this energy crisis, both in the Congress and in the White House, and if you entrust me with the presidency, I will tackle this problem and focus on new technologies that will make us less dependent on big oil or foreign oil.", " Well I would first say he should have been tackling it for the last seven years.", "Secondly the difference is we need to explore at home.", "And the vice president doesn't believe in exploration in Alaska.", "There's a lot of shut-in gas that we need to be moving out of Alaska by pipeline.", "There's an interesting issue up in the northwest as well.", "Do we remove dams that produce hydroelectric energy?", "I'm against removing dams in the northwest.", "I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know where the vice president stands but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a renewable energy source of energy.",

"I'm going to ask the Congress for $2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal technologies in the world.", "My answer to you is in the short-term we need to get after it here in America.", "We need to explore our resources and we need to develop our reservoirs of domestic production.", "We also need to have a hemispheric energy policy where Canada, Mexico and the United States come together.", "I brought this up recently with Vincent Fox the newly elected president in Mexico, he's a man I know from Mexico.", "I talked to him about how best to expedite the exploration of natural gas in Mexico and transport it up to the United States so we become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil.", "This is a major problem facing America.", "The administration did not deal with it.", "It's time for a new administration to deal with the energy problem.", " If I may just briefly, Jim, note.", "I found a couple of other things we agree upon.", "We may not find that many this evening, so I wanted to emphasize.", "I strongly support new investments in clean coal technology.", "I made a proposal three months ago on this.", "And also domestic exploration yes, but not in the environmental treasures of our country.", "We don't have to do that.", "That's the wrong choice.", "I know the oil companies have been itching to do that, but it is not the right thing for the future.", " No.", "It's the right thing for the consumers.", "Less dependency upon foreign sources of crude is good for consumers.", "And we can do so in an environmentally friendly way.", " Well can I have the last word on this?", " I don't think a president can do that.", "I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and I'm worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions.", "This is a very important topic and it's a very sensitive topic, because a lot of good people disagree on the issue.", "I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America.", "Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country.", "Life of the unborn.", "As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life.", "I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America.",

opponent and I have strong disagreement.", "I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America.", "This is an issue that will require a new attitude.", "We've been battling over abortion for a long period of time.", "Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life.", "Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors to -- to allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors.", "Surely we can work together to create a cultural life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbor's life with a gun will understand that that's not the way America is meant to be.", "Surely we can find common ground to reduce the number of abortions in America.", "As to the drug itself, I mentioned I was disappointed.", "I hope the FDA took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug.", " Well, Jim, the FDA took 12 years, and I do support that decision.", "They determined it was medically safe for the women who use that drug.", "This is indeed a very important issue.", "First of all on the issue of partial birth or so-called late-term abortion, I would sign a law banning that procedure, provided that doctors have the ability to save a woman's life or to act if her health is severely at risk.", "That's not the main issue.", "The main issue is whether or not the Roe v. Wade decision is going to be overturned.", "I support a woman's right to choose.", "My opponent does not.", "It is important because the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court.", "And Governor Bush has declared to the anti-choice groups that he will appoint justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who are known for being the most vigorous opponents of a woman's right to choose.", "Here is the difference.", "He trusts the government to order a woman to do what it thinks she ought to do.", "I trust women to make the decisions that affect their lives, their destinies and their bodies.", "And I think a woman's right to choose ought to be protected and defended.", " I don't think a president can unilaterally overturn it.", "The FDA has made its decision.", " I think once a decision has been made, it's been made unless it's proven to be unsafe to women.", " Jim, the question you asked, if I heard you correctly, was would he support legislation to overturn it.", "And if I heard the statement day before yesterday, you said you would order -- he said he would order his FDA appointee to review the decision.", "Now that sounds to me a little bit different.", "I just think that we ought to support the decision.", " I said I would make sure that women would be safe who used the drug.", " I am pro-life.", " The voters should assume I have no litmus test on that issue or any other issue.", "Voters will know I'll put competent judges on the bench.", "People who will strictly interpret the Constitution and not use the bench to write social policy.", "That is going to be a big difference between my opponent and me.", "I believe that the judges ought not to take the place of the legislative branch of government.", "That they're appointed for life and that they ought to look at the Constitution as sacred.", "They shouldn't misuse their bench.", "I don't believe in liberal activist judges.", "I believe in strict constructionists.", "Those are the kind of judges I will appoint.", "I've named four supreme court justices in the State of Texas and would ask the people to check out their qualifications, their deliberations.", "They're good, solid men and women who have made good, sound judgments on behalf of the people of Texas.", " We both use similar language to reach an exactly opposite outcome.", "I don't favor a litmus test, but I know that there are ways to assess how a potential justice interprets the Constitution.", "And in my view, the Constitution ought to be interpreted as a document that grows with our country and our history.", "And I believe, for example, that there is a right of privacy in the Fourth Amendment.", "And when the phrase a strict constructionist is used and when the names of Scalia and Thomas are used as the benchmarks for who would be appointed, those are code words, and nobody should mistake this, for saying the governor would appoint people who would overturn Roe v. Wade.", "It's very clear to me.", "I would appoint people that have a philosophy that I think would have it quite likely they would uphold Roe v. Wade.", " It sounds like the vice president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not right very many times tonight.", "I just told you the criteria on which I'll appoint judges.", "I have a record of appointing judges in the State of Texas.", "That's what a governor gets to do.", "A governor gets to name supreme court judges.", "He also reads all kinds of things into my tax plan and into my Medicare plan.", "I want the viewers out there to listen to what I have to say about it.", " It would be likely that they would uphold Roe v. Wade.", "I do believe it's wrong to use a litmus test.", "If you look at the history of a lower court judge's rulings, you can get a pretty good idea of how they'll interpret questions.", "A lot of questions are first impression, and these questions that have been seen many times come up in a new context and so -- but, you know, this is a very important issue.", "Because a lot of young women in this country take this right for granted and it could be lost.", "It is on the ballot in this election, make no mistake about it.", " I'll tell you what kind of judges he'll put on.", "He'll put liberal activists justices who will use their bench to subvert the legislature, that's what he'll do.", " That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not right.", " Well, Milosevic has lost the election.", "His opponent, Kostunica, has won the election.", "It's overwhelming.", "Milosevic's government refuses to release the vote count.", "There's now a general strike going on.", "They're demonstrating.", "I think we should support the people of Serbia and Yugoslavia, as they call the Serbia plus Montenegro, and put pressure in every way possible to recognize the lawful outcome of the election.", "The people of Serbia have acted very bravely in kicking this guy out of office.", "Now he is trying to not release the votes and then go straight to a so-called runoff election without even announcing the results of the first vote.", "Now, we've made it clear, along with our allies, that when Milosevic leaves, then Serbia will be able to have a more normal relationship with the rest of the world.", "That is a very strong incentive that we've given them to do the right thing.", "Bear in mind also, Milosevic has been indicted as a war criminal and he should be held accountable for his actions.", "Now, we have to take measured steps because the sentiment within Serbia is, for understandable reasons, against the United States because their nationalism -- even if they don't like Milosevic, they still have some feelings lingering from the NATO action there.", "So we have to be intelligent in the way we go about it.", "But make no mistake about it, we should do everything we can to see that the will of the Serbian people expressed in this extraordinary election is done.", "And I hope that he'll be out of office very shortly.", " Well, I'm pleased with the results of the election.", "As the vice president is.", "It's time for the man to go.", "It means that the United States must have a strong diplomatic hand with our friends in NATO.", "That's why it's important to make sure our alliances are as strong as they possibly can be to keep the pressure on Mr. Milosevic.", "But this will be an interesting moment for the Russians to step up and lead as well.", "Be a wonderful time for the Russians to step into the Balkans and convince Mr. Milosevic that it's in his best interest and his country's best interest to leave office.", "The Russians have a lot of sway in that part of the world.", "We would like to see the Russians use that sway to encourage democracy to take hold.", "It's an encouraging election.", "It's time for the man to leave.", " In this particular situation, no.", "Bear in mind that we have a lot of sanctions in force against Serbia right now.", "And the people of Serbia know that they can escape all those sanctions if this guy is turned out of power.", "Now, I understand what the governor has said about asking the Russians to be involved, and under some circumstances that might be a good idea.", "But being as they have not yet been willing to recognize Kostunica as the lawful winner of the election, I'm not sure it's right for us to invite the president of Russia to mediate this -- this dispute there because we might not like the results that comes out of that.", "They currently favor going forward with a runoff election.", "I think that's the wrong thing.", "I think the governor's instinct is not necessarily bad because we have worked with the Russians in a constructive way in Kosovo, for example, to end the conflict there.", "But I think we need to be very careful in the present situation before we invite the Russians to play the lead role in mediating.", " Well obviously we wouldn't use the Russians if they didn't agree with our answer, Mr. Vice President.", " They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.", " Let me say this to you, I wouldn't use force.", "I wouldn't use force.", " No.", " It's not in our national interest to use force in this case.", "I would use pressure and diplomacy.", "There is a difference with what the president did in Kosovo which I supported and this.", "It's up to the people in this region to take control of their country.", " Well, if it's in our vital national interests, and that means whether our territory is threatened or people could be harmed, whether or not the alliances are -- our defense alliances are threatened, whether or not our friends in the Middle East are threatened.", "That would be a time to seriously consider the use of force.", "Secondly, whether or not the mission was clear.", "Whether or not it was a clear understanding as to what the mission would be.", "Thirdly,

commit our troops.", "The vice president and I have a disagreement about the use of troops.", "He believes in nation building.", "I would be very careful about using our troops as nation builders.",

sure we rebuild our military power.", "Morale in today's military is too low.", "We're having trouble meeting recruiting goals.", "We met the goals this year, but in the previous years we have not met recruiting goals.", "Some of our troops are not well-equipped.", "I believe we're overextended in too many places.", "And therefore I want to rebuild the military power.", "It starts with a billion

presidency, I will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure our forces stay the strongest in the world.", "In fact, in my ten-year budget proposal I've set aside more than twice as much for this purpose as Governor Bush has in his proposal.", "Now, I think we should be reluctant to get involved in someplace in a foreign country.", "But if our national security is at stake, if we have allies, if we've tried every other course, if we're sure military action will succeed, and if the costs are proportionate to the benefits, we should get involved.", "Now, just because we don't want to get involved everywhere doesn't mean we should back off anywhere it comes up.", "I disagree with the proposal that maybe only when oil supplies are at stake that our national security is at risk.", "I think that there are situations like in Bosnia or Kosovo where there's a genocide, where our national security is at stake there.", " I agree our military is the strongest in the world today, that's not the question.", "The question is will it be the strongest in the years to come?", "The warning signs are real.", "Everywhere I go on the campaign trail I see moms and dads whose son or daughter

don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do something if we don't have a clear vision of the military, if we don't stop extending our troops all around the world and nation building missions, then we're going to have a serious problem coming down the road, and I'm going to prevent that.", "I'm going to rebuild our military power.", "It's one of the major priorities of my administration.", " Well, they should look at our proposals and look at us as people and make up their own minds.", "When I was a young man, I volunteered for the Army.", "I served my country in Vietnam.", "My father was a senator who strongly opposed the Vietnam War.", "I went to college in this great city, and most of my peers felt against the war as I did.", "But I went anyway because I knew if I didn't, somebody else in the small town

troops have the latest technology.", "The governor has proposed skipping the next generation of weapons.", "I think that's a big mistake, because I think we have to stay at the cutting edge.", " I think you've got to look at how one has handled responsibility in office.", "Whether or not it's -- the same in domestic policy as well.", "Whether or not you have the capacity to convince people to follow?", "Whether or not one makes decisions based on sound principles or whether or not you rely upon polls and focus groups on how to decide what the course of action is.", "We have too much polling and focus groups going on in Washington today.", "We need decisions made on sound principles.", "I've been the governor of a big state.", "I think one of the hallmarks of my relationship in

examples.", "For every new dollar that I propose for spending on health care, Governor Bush spends $3 for a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%.", "Now, for every dollar that I propose to spend on education, he spends $5 on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%.", "Those are very clear differences.", " The man is practicing fuzzy math again.", "There's differences.", "Under Vice President Gore's

governor deny these numbers.", "He's called them phony and fuzzy.", "The fact remains almost 30% of his proposed tax cut goes to -- only to Americans that make more than $1 million per year.", "More money goes to the -- can I have a rebuttal here?", " Let me tell you what the facts are.", "The facts are after my plan, the wealthiest of Americans pay more taxes of the percentage of the whole than

left Sarasota, Florida.", "I'm here with a group of 13 people from around the country who helped me prepare.", "We had a great time.", "Two days ago we ate lunch at a restaurant.", "The guy that served us lunch gave me a letter today.", "His name is Randy Ellis.", "He has a 15-year-old daughter named Caley, who is in Sarasota High School.", "Her science class was supposed to be for 24 students.", "She's the 36th student in that classroom.", "They sent me a picture of her in the classroom.", "They can't squeeze another desk in for her, so she has to stand during class.", "I want the federal government, consistent with local control and new accountability, to make improvement of our schools the number one priority so Caley will have a desk and can sit down in a classroom where she can learn.", " The first is, the difference is there is no new accountability measures in Vice President Gore's plan.", "He says he's for voluntary testing.", "You can't have voluntary testing.", "You must have mandatory testing.", "You must say that if you receive money you must show us whether or not children are learning to read and write and add and subtract.", "That's the difference.", "You may claim you've got mandatory testing but you don't, Mr. Vice President.", "That's a huge difference.", "Testing is the cornerstone of reform.", "You know how I know?", "Because it's the cornerstone of reform in the State of Texas.", "Republicans and Democrats came together and said what can we do to make our public education the best in the country?", "We've done a long way working together to do so.", "The cornerstone is to have strong accountability in return for money and in return for flexibility.", "We're going to ask you to show us whether or not -- we ask you to post the results on the Internet.", "We encourage parents to take a look at the comparative results of schools.", "We have a strong charter school movement that I signed the legislation to get started in the State of Texas.", "I believe if we find poor children trapped in schools that won't teach, we need to free the parents.", "We need to expand education savings accounts.", "Something that the vice president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s running mate supports.", "There's big differences.", "He won't support freeing local districts from the strings of federal money.", " First of all, I do have mandatory testing.", "I think the governor may not have heard what I said clearly.", "The voluntary national testing is in addition to the mandatory testing that we require of states.", "All schools, all school districts, students themselves, and required teacher testing, which goes a step farther than Governor Bush has been willing to go.", "Here are a couple of differences, though, Jim.", "Governor Bush is in favor of vouchers which take taxpayer money away from public schools and give them to private schools that are not accountable for how the money is used and don't have to take all applicants.", "Now, private schools play a great role in our society.", "All of our children have gone to both public schools and private schools.", "But I don't think private schools should have a right to take taxpayer money away from public schools at a time when Caley Ellis is standing in that classroom.", "Let me give you another example.", "I went to a school in Dade County, Florida where the facilities are so overcrowded the children have to eat lunch in shifts with the first shift for lunch starting at 9:30 in the morning.", "Look, this is a funding crisis all around the country.", "There are fewer parents of school-age children as a percentage of the voting population and there is the largest generation of students ever.", "We're in an information age when learning is more important than ever.", "90% of our kids go to public schools.", "We have to make it the number one priority.", "Modernize our schools, reduce class size, recruit new teachers, give every child a chance to learn with one-on-one time in a quality -- high-quality, safe school.", "If it's a failing school, shut it down and reopen it under a new principal with a turnaround team of specialists the way Governor Jim Hunt does in North Carolina.", "Here is another difference.", "The governor, if it's a failing school, would leave the children in that failing school for three years and then give a little bit of money to the parents, a down payment on a down payment for private school tuition, and pretend that that would be enough for them to go out and go to a private school.", "It's an illusion.", " Okay.", "First of all, most of good governance is at the state level.", "See, here is the mentality.", "I'm going to make the state do this and make the state do that.", "All I'm saying is if you spend money, show us results and test every year, which you do not do, Mr. Vice President.", "You don't test every year.", "You can say you do to the cameras but you don't, unless you've changed your plan here on the stage.", " I didn't say that.", " You need to test every year.", "That's how you determine if children are progressing to excellence.", "Secondly, one of the things that we have to be careful about in politics is throwing money at a system that has not yet been reformed.", "More money is needed and I spend more money, but step one is to make sure we reform the system to have the system in place that leaves no child behind.", "Stop this business about asking gosh, how old are you?", "If you're 10 we'll put you here, 12 you put here.", "Start asking the question, what do you know?", "If you don't know what you're supposed to know, we'll make sure you do early before it's too late.", " When the action in Kosovo was dragging on and we were searching for a solution to the problem, our country had defeated the adversary on the battlefield without a single American life being lost in combat.", "But the dictator Milosevic was hanging on.", "I invited the former prime minister of Russia to my house and took a risk in asking him to get personally involved, along with the head of Finland, to go to Belgrade and to take a set of proposals from the United States that would constitute basically a surrender by Serbia.", "But it was a calculated risk that paid off.", "Now, I could probably give you some other examples of decisions over the last 24 years.", "I have been in public service for 24 years, Jim.", "And throughout all that time the people I have fought for have been the middle-class families, and I have been willing to stand up to powerful interests like the big insurance companies, the drug companies, the HMOs, the oil companies.", "They have good people and they play constructive roles sometimes, but sometimes they get too much power.", "I cast my lot with the people even when it means that you have to stand up to some powerful interests who are trying to turn the -- the policies and the laws to their advantage.", "You can see it in this campaign.", "The big drug companies support Governor Bush's prescription drug proposal.", "They oppose mine because they don't want to get Medicare involved because they're afraid that Medicare will negotiate lower prices for seniors who currently pay the highest prices of all.", " I've been standing up to big Hollywood, big trial lawyers.", "Was \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what was the question?", "It was about emergencies, wasn't it?", " You know, as governor, one of the things you have to deal with is catastrophe.", "I can remember the fires that swept Parker County, Texas.", "I remember the floods that swept our state.", "I remember going down to Del Rio, Texas.", "I have to pay the administration a compliment.", "James Lee Witt of FEMA has done a really good job of working with governors during times of crisis.", "But that's the time when you're tested not only -- it's the time to test your mettle, a time to test your heart when you see people whose lives have been turned upside down.", "It broke my heart to go to the flood scene in Del Rio where a fellow and his family got completely uprooted.", "The only thing I knew to do was to get aid as quickly as possible with state and federal help, and to put my arms around the man and his family and cry with them.", "That's what governors do.", "They are often on the front line of catastrophic situations.", " Well, it depends, obviously.", "But what I would do first and foremost, is I would get in touch with the Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, to find out all the facts and all the circumstances.", "I would have my Secretary of the Treasury be in touch with the financial centers not only here, but at home.", "I would make sure that key members of Congress were called in to discuss the gravity of the situation.", "And I would come up with a game plan to deal with it.", "That's what governors end up doing.", "We end up being problem solvers.", "We come up with practical, common sense solutions for problems that we're confronted with.", "In this case, in the case of a financial crisis, I would gather all the facts before I made the decision as to what the government ought or ought not to do.", " First I want to compliment the governor on his response to those fires and floods in Texas.", "I accompanied James Lee Witt down to Texas when those fires broke out.", "And FEMA has been a major flagship project of our reinventing government efforts.", "And I agree, it works extremely well now.", "On the international financial crises that come up, my friend, Bob Rubin, the former Secretary of Treasury is here, he's a close advisor to me and great friend in all respects.", "I have had a chance to work with him and Alan Greenspan and others on the crisis following the collapse of the Mexican peso.", "When the Asian financial crisis raised the risk of world-wide recession that could affect our economy, And now, of course, the euro's value has been dropping, but seems to be under control.", "But it started for me in the last eight years when I had the honor of casting the tie-breaking vote to end the old economic plan here at home and put into place a new economic plan that has helped us to make some progress, 22 million new jobs, the greatest prosperity ever.", "But it's not good enough.", "My attitude is you ain't seen nothing yet.", "We need to do more and better.", " No, there's no difference on that.", "There is a difference, though, as to what the economy has meant.", "I think the economy has meant more for the Gore and Clinton folks than the Gore and Clinton folks have meant for the economy.", "I think most of the economic growth that has taken place is a result of ingenuity and hard work and entrepreneurship and that's the role of goverment to encourage that.", "In terms of in response to the question, no.", " Can I comment on that?", " You know, I think the American people deserve credit for the great economy that we have.", "It's their ingenuity, I agree with that.", "But you know, they were working pretty hard eight years ago.", "And now they had ingenuity eight years ago.", "The difference is we've got a new policy.", "And instead of concentrating on tax cuts mostly for the wealthy, we want -- I want tax cuts for the middle-class families and I want to continue the prosperity and make sure that it enriches not just a few but all of our families.", "We have gone from the biggest deficits to the biggest surpluses.", "We have gone from a triple-dip recession during the previous 12 years to a tripling of the stock market.", "Instead of a high unemployment, we have the lowest African-American and Latin American unemployment rates in history and 22 million new jobs.", "It's not good enough.", "Too many people have been left behind.", "We have got to do much more.", "The key is job training, education, investments in health care and education, environment, retirement security.", "And incidentally, we have got to preserve Social Security.", "I'm totally opposed to diverting one out of every six dollars out of the Social Security trust fund, as the Governor has proposed, into the stock market.", "I want new incentives for savings and investment for the young couples who are working hard so they can save and invest on their own on top of Social Security, not at the expense of Social Security, as the governor proposes.", " Two points.", "One, a lot of folks are still waiting for that 1992 middle-class tax cut.", "I remember the vice president saying, \"Just give us a chance to get up there, we're going to make sure you get tax cuts.\"", "It didn't happen.", "Now he's having to say that again.", "They've had their chance to deliver a tax cut to you.", "Secondly, the surest way to bust this economy is to increase the role and size of the federal budget.", "The Senate Budget Committee did a study of the vice president's expenditures.", "It's been projected that they could conceivably bust the budget by $900 billion.", "That means he'll either have to raise your taxes by $900 billion or go into the Social Security surplus for $900 billion.", "This is a plan that is going to increase the bureaucracy by 20,000 people.", "His targeted tax cut is so detailed, so much fine print that it is going to require numerous IRS agents.", "We need somebody to simplify the code, to be fair, to continue prosperity by sharing some of the surplus with the people who pay the bills, particularly those at the bottom end of the economic ladder.", " If I could respond, Jim.", "What he's quoting is not the Senate Budget Commiitte, it is a partisan press release by the Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee that's not worth the government -- the taxpayer-paid paper that it's printed on.", "Now, as for 20,000 new bureaucrats, as you call them, you know, the size of the federal government will go down in a Gore administration.", "In the reinventing government program you just look at the numbers.", "It is 300,000 people smaller today than it was eight years ago.", "Now, the fact is you're going to have a hard time convincing folks that we were a whole lot better off eight years ago than we are today.", "But that's not the question.", "The question is, will we be better off four years from now than we are today?", "And as for the surest way to threaten our prosperity, having a $1.9 trillion tax cut, almost half of which goes to the wealthy, and a $1 trillion Social Security privatization proposal is the surest way to put our budget into deficit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c raise interest rates and put our prosperity at risk.", " I can't let the man continue with fuzzy math.", "It is 1.3 trillion Mr. Vice President.", "It will go to everybody who pays taxes.", "I'm not going to be the kind of president that says you get tax relief and you don't.", "I'm not going to be a picker and chooser.", "What is fair is everybody who pays taxes ought to get relief.", " Suits me.", " I do disagree.", "Because if we can keep our prosperity going, if we can continue balancing the budget and paying down the debt, then the strong economy keeps generating surpluses.", "Here is my plan.", "I will keep Social Security in a lockbox and that pays down the national debt.", "And the interest savings I would put right back into Social Security.", "That extends the life of Social Security for 55 years.", "Now, I think that it's very important to understand that cutting benefits under Social Security means that people like Winifred Skinner from Des Moines, Iowa, who is here, would really have a much harder time.", "Because there are millions of seniors who are living almost hand to mouth.", "And you talk about cutting benefits.", "I don't go along with it.", "I am opposed to it.", "I'm also opposed to a plan that diverts 1 out of every $6 away from the Social Security Trust Fund.", "Social Security is a trust fund that pays the checks this year with the money that is paid into Social Security this year.", "The governor wants to divert 1 out of every $6 off into the stock market, which means that he would drain a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund in this generation over the next ten years, and Social Security under that approach would go bankrupt within this generation.", "His leading advisor on this plan actually said that would be okay, because then the Social Security Trust Fund could start borrowing.", "It would borrow up to $3 trillion.", "Now, Social Security has never done that.", "And I don't think it should do that.", "I think it should stay in a lockbox, and I'll tell you this.", "I will veto anything that takes money out of Social Security for privatization or anything else other than Social Security.", " I thought it was interesting that on the two minutes he spent about a million-and-a-half on my plan, which means he doesn't want you to know what he's doing is loading up IOUs for future generations.", "He puts no real assets into the Social Security system.", "The revenues exceed the expenses in Social Security until the year 2015 which means all retirees are going to get the promises made.", "For those of you who he wants to scare into the voting booth to vote for him, hear me loud and clear.", "A promise made will be a promise kept.", "You bet we want to allow younger workers to take some of their own money.", "That's the difference of opinion.", "The vice president thinks it's the government's money.", "The payroll taxes are your money.", "You ought to put it in prudent, safe investments so that $1 trillion over the next ten years grows to be $3 trillion.", "The money stays within the Social Security system.", "It's a part of the Social Security system.", "He claims it will be out of Social Security.", "It's your money, it's a part of your retirement benefit.", "It's a fundamental difference between what we believe.", "I want you to have your own asset that you can call your own.", "That you can pass on from one generation to the next.", "I want to get a better rate of return for your own money than the paltry 2% that the current Social Security Trust gets today.", "Mr. Greenspan I thought missed an opportunity to say there's a third way, and that is to get a better rate of return on the Social Security monies coming into the trust.", "There is $2.3 trillion of surplus that we can use to make sure that younger workers have a Social Security plan in the future.", "If we're smart and if we trust workers and if we understand the power of the compounding rate of interest.", " Here is the difference.", "I give a new incentive for younger workers to save their own money and invest their own money, but not at the expense of Social Security, on top of Social Security.", "My plan is Social Security plus.", "The governor's plan is Social Security minus.", "Your future benefits would be cut by the amount that's diverted into the stock market.", "If you make bad investments, that's too bad.", "But even before then the problem hits because the money contributed to Social Security this year is an entitlement.", "That's how it works.", "And the money is used to pay the benefits for seniors this year.", "If you cut the amount going in 1 out of every $6, then you have to cut the value of each check by 1 out of every $6 unless you come up with the money from somewhere else.", "I would like to know from the governor -- I know we're not supposed to ask each other questions -- but I'd be interested in knowing, does that trillion dollars come from the trust fund, or does it come from the rest of the budget?", " No.", "There's enough money to pay seniors today in the current affairs of Social Security.", "The trillion comes from the surplus.", "Surplus is money -- more money than needed.", "Let me tell you what your plan is.", "It's not Social Security plus, it's Social Security plus huge debt.", "That is what it is.", "You leave future generations with tremendous IOUs.", "It's time to have a leader that doesn't put off tomorrow what we should do today.", "It's time to have somebody to step up and say look, let's let younger workers take some of their own money and under certain guidelines invest it in the private markets.", "The safest of federal investments yields 4%.", "That's twice the amount of rate of return than the current Social Security Trust.", "It's a fundamental difference of opinion here, folks.", "Younger worker after younger worker hears my call that says I trust you.", "And you know what, the issue is changing.", "Seniors now understand that the promise made will be a promise kept, but younger workers now understand we better have a government that trusts them and that's exactly what I'm going to do.", " Could I respond to that, Jim?", "This is a big issue.", "Could we do another round on it?", " Just briefly.", "When FDR established Social Security, they didn't call them IOUs, they called it the full faith and credit of the United States.", "If you don't have trust in that, I do.", "If you take it out of the surplus in the trust fund, that means the trust fund goes bankrupt in this generation within 20 years.", " This is a government that thinks a 2% rate of return on your money is satisfactory.", "It's not.", "This is a government that says younger workers can't possibly have their own assets.", "We need to think differently about the issue.", "We need to make sure our seniors get the promise made.", "If we don't trust younger workers to manage some of their own money with the Social Security surplus, to grow from $1 trillion to $3 trillion, it will be impossible to bridge the gap without it.", "What Mr. Gore's plan will do causing huge payroll taxes or major benefit reductions.", " The man loves his wife and I appreciate that a lot.", "And I love mine.", "The man loves his family a lot, and I appreciate that, because I love my family.", "I think the thing that discouraged me about the vice president was uttering those famous words, \"No controlling legal authority.\"", "I felt like there needed to be a better sense of responsibility of what was going on in the White House.", "I believe that -- I believe they've moved that sign, \"The buck stops here\" from the Oval Office desk to \"The buck stops here\" on the Lincoln bedroom.", "It's not good for the country and it's not right.", "We need to have a new look about how we conduct ourselves in office.", "There's a huge trust.", "I see it all the time when people come up to me and say, I don't want you to let me down again.", "And we can do better than the past administration has done.", "It's time for a fresh start.", "It's time for a new look.", "It's time for a fresh start after a season of cynicism.", "And so I don't know the man well, but I've been disappointed about how he and his administration have conducted the fundraising affairs.", "You know, going to a Buddhist temple and then claiming it wasn't a fundraiser isn't my view of responsibility.", " I think we ought to attack our country's problems, not attack each other.", "I want to spend my time making this country even better than it is, not trying to make you out to be a bad person.", "You may want to focus on scandal.", "I want to focus on results.", "As I said a couple of months ago, I stand here as my own man and I want you to see me for who I really am.", "Tipper and I have been married for 30 years.", "We became grandparents a year-and-a-half ago.", "We've got four children.", "I have devoted 24 years of my life to public service and I've said this before and I'll say it again, if you entrust me with the presidency, I may not be the most exciting politician, but I will work hard for you every day.", "I will fight for middle-class families and working men and women and I will never let you down.", " They ought to factor in it when they go to the voting booth.", " I think people need to be held responsible for the actions they take in life.", "I think that -- well, I think that's part of the need for a cultural change.", "We need to say we each need to be responsible for what we do.", "People in the highest office of the land must be responsible for decisions they make in life.", "And that's the way I've conducted myself as Governor of Texas and that's the way I'll conduct myself as President of the United States, should I be fortunate enough to earn your vote.", " No.", "I think the American people should take into account who we are as individuals, what our experience is, what our positions are on the issues and proposals are.", "I'm asking you to see me for who I really am.", "I'm offering you my own vision, my own experience, my own proposals.", "And incidentally, one of them is this.", "This current campaign financing system has not reflected credit on anybody in either party.", "And that's one of the reasons I've said before, and I'll pledge here tonight, if I'm president, the very first bill that Joe Lieberman and I will send to the United States Congress is the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill.", "And the reason it's that important is that all of the other issues, whether prescription drugs for all seniors that are opposed by the drug companies or the patient's bill of rights to take the decisions away from the HMOs and give them to the doctors and nurses, opposed by the HMOs and insurance companies, all these other proposals are going to be a lot easier to get passed for the American people if we limit the influence of special interest money and give democracy back to the American people.", "And I wish Governor Bush would join me this evening in endorsing the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform Bill.", " You know, this man has no credibility on the issue.", "As a matter of fact, I read in the \"New York Times\" where he said he co-sponsored the McCain-Feingold Campaign Fundraising Bill.", "But he wasn't in the Senate with Senator Feingold.", "And so, look, I'm going to -- what you need to know about me is I will uphold the law, I'm going to have an attorney general that enforces the law.", "The time for campaign funding reform is after the election.", "This man has outspent me and the special interests are outspending me.", "And I am not going to lay down my arms in the middle of the campaign for somebody who has got no credibility on the issue.", " I would support an effort to ban corporate soft money and labor union soft money so long as there was dues check-off.", "I've campaigned on this since the primaries.", "I believe there needs to be instant disclosure on the Internet as to who has given to who.", "I think we need to fully enforce the law.", "I think we need to have an attorney general that says if a law is broken, we'll enforce it.", "Be strict and firm about it.", " Look, Governor Bush, you have attacked my character and credibility and I am not going to respond in kind.", "I think we ought to focus on the problems and not attack each other.", "One of the serious problems, hear me well, is that our system of government is being undermined by too much influence coming from special interest money.", "We have to get a handle on it.", "And like John McCain, I have learned from experience, and it's not a new position for me.", "24 years ago I supported full public financing of all federal elections.", "And anybody who thinks I'm just saying it, it will be the first bill I send to the Congress.", "I want you to know I care passionately about this and I will fight until it becomes law.",

use the prosperity to enrich all of our families and not just a few?", "One important way of looking at this is to ask who are you going to fight for?", "Throughout my career in public service, I have fought for the working men and women of this country, middle-class families.", "Why?", "Because you are the ones who have the hardest time paying taxes, the hardest time making ends meet.", "You are the ones who are making car payments and mortgage payments and doing right by your kids.", "And a lot of times there are powerful forces that are against you.", "Make no mistake about it, they do have undue influence in Washington, D.C. and it makes a difference if you have a president who will fight for you.", "I know one thing about the position of president, it's the only position in our Constitution that is filled by an individual who is given the responsibility to fight not just for one state or one district or the well-connected or wealthy, but to fight for all of the people,

position on tuition tax credits.", "They're different on busing; she voted to extend the grain embargo; he now says that he was against it.", "If they win - and I hope they don't - but if they win,

Office anytime and give him my judgment and he might agree or he might not.", "But he also knows I won't be talking about it to the press or I won't be knifing him in the back by leaking to make me

his support of the president's economic program and how everything is just going so beautifully.", "I, too, recall when Vice President Bush was running in the primary against President Reagan and he called the program voodoo economics, and it was and it is.", "We are facing absolutely massive deficits; this administration has chosen to ignore it; the president has failed to put forth a plan to

primary schools.", "But Fritz Mondale and I feel very strongly that if you educate your children that that's an effort and the way that you build up and make a stronger America.", "With reference to civil rights I think you've got to go beyond that and if you take a look, also, at my record in the Congress and Fritz Mondale's record, both in the Senate and as vice president, we both have extremely strong civil rights records.", "This administration does not.", "It has come in in the Bob Jones on the side of segregated academies.", "It came in in the Grove City case on the side of discrimination against women, the handicapped, and the elderly.", "As a matter of fact, in the Congress we just passed overwhelmingly the Civil Rights Bill of 1984 and this administration, the

contrary, if you have a growing economy, if you create the jobs, if you allow for small business the opportunity with lower interest rates to reach out and grow, there will be more than enough space

are going in the right direction that's good, that's a civil right.", "Similarly, we think of it in terms of quality of life, and that means interest rates.", "You know, it's funny, Mr. Mondale talks about real interest rates.", "The real interest rate is what you pay when you go down and try to buy a TV set or buy a car, or do whatever it is.", "The interest rates when we left office were 21%

the Congress, in the Senate, it was passed despite his opposition, and he did sign it because he was required to do so.", "In the civil rights cases that he mentioned, the great number of cases that they have enforced, the reason they enforced them because under the law they're required to do that.", "And I'm delighted that the administration is following the law.", "With reference", " I just have to correct in my thirty seconds that are left the comment that the vice-president made with reference specifically to a program like AFDC.", "If you take AFDC, if you take food stamps, if you take - oh, go down the line on poor people's programs, those are the programs that suffered considerably under this administration's first budget cuts and those are the ones that in the second part of their part of their term, we were able to restore some of those terribly, terribly unfair cuts to the poor people of this country.", " Well, maybe we have a factual - maybe we can ask the experts to go to the books.", "They'll do it anyway.", "Spending for food stamps is way, way up under the Reagan administration, AFDC is up under the Reagan administration, and I'm not going to be found wrong on that.", "I am sure of my facts, and we are trying to help and I think we're doing a reasonable job, but we are not going to rest until every single American that wants a job and until this prosperity and this recovery that's benefiting many Americans, benefits all Americans.", " I do believe in pluralism.", "I do believe in separation of church and state.", "I don't consider abortion a religious issue.", "I consider it a moral issue.", "I believe the archbishop has every right to do everything he wants in that direction, just as I never faulted Jesse Jackson from taking his message to the black pulpits all across this country, just as I never objected when the nuclear arms, the nuclear freeze or the antinuclear people - many of those movements were led by priests.", "Suddenly, because a Catholic bishop or an evangelist feels strongly on a political issue, people are saying it's merging of church and state.", "We favor - and I speak confidently for the president - we favor separation of church and state.", "We favor pluralism.", "Now somebody says you ought to restore prayer in schools.", "You don't think it's right to prohibit a kid from praying in schools.", "For years kids were allowed to pray in schools.", "We don't think that's a merger of church and stare to have nonmandatory voluntary, nongovernment-ordered prayer.", "And yet some are accusing us of injecting religion into politics.", "I have no problem with what the archbishop does, and I have no problem with what the evangelists on the right do and I have no problem what the priests on the left do.", "And it didn't bother me when during the Vietnam War much of the opposition to the government - Democrat and Republican governments - was led by priests, encouraging people to break the law and the adage of the - you know - the civil disobedience thing.", "So our position, separation of church and stare, pluralism, so no little kid with a minority religion of some sort is going to feel offended or feel left out or feel uncomfortable.", "But, yes, prayer in school on a voluntary basis worked for many, many years until the Supreme Court ruled differently And I'm glad we got this question because I think there's been too much said about religion and politics.", "We don't believe in denominationally moving in.", "It wasn't our side that raised the question about our president whether he was a good Christian or not and so I, so that's our position - separation of church and state, pluralism, respect for all.", " You know, there has been - I have to make a confession - an evolution in my position.", "There's been 15 million abortions since 1973, and I don't take that lightly.", "There's been a million and a half this year.", "The president and I do favor a human rights amendment.", "I favor one that would have an exception for incest and rape, and he doesn't, but we both - only for the life of the mother.", "And I agree with him on that.", "So yes, my position's evolved, but I'd like to see the American who faced with 15 million abortions isn't rethinking his or her position and I'll just stand with the answer.", "I support the president's position - and comfortably - from a moral standpoint.", " No, I support the president's position.", " Let me say first of all I believe very, very sincerely in the separation of church and state.", "I'm taking it from the historical viewpoint, if you go back to the 1600s when people came here, the reason they came to this country was to escape religious persecution, and that's the same reason why people are coming here today in the 1940s to escape Nazism, now in the 1980s and 1984 when they can get our of the country to escape communism so they can come here and practice their religion.", "Our country is founded on the principle that our government should be neutral as far as religion is concerned.", "Now what's happened over the past several years, and quite frankly I'm not going to let you lay on me the intrusion of state politics into religion or religion into politics by my comments with reference to the president's policies, because it started in 1980 when this administration was running for office and the Reverend Jerry Falwell became very, very involved in the campaign.", "What has happened over the past four years has been I think a real fudging of that line with the separation of church and state.", "The actions of the archbishops let me say to you I feel that they have not only a right but a responsibility to speak up, and even though I've been the person that they're speaking up about, l feel they do have the responsibility to do so, and I have no problem with it, no more than I did a priest who marched at the time of Vietnam and no more than I did at the time when Martin Luther King marched at the time of the civil rights marches.", "I have absolutely no problem with them speaking up, I think they have an obligation as well as a right.", "But what I do have a problem with is when the president of the United States gets up in Dallas and addresses a group of individuals and said to them that anybody who doesn't support his constitutional amendment for prayer in the schools is intolerant of religion.", "Now there are numerous groups who don't support that prayer in the school, numerous religious groups.", "Are they intolerant of religion?", "Is that what the president is saying?", "I also object, when I am told, that the Reverend Falwell has been told that he would pick two of our Supreme Court justices.", "That's going a little bit far.", "In that instance, let me say to you it is more than a fudging at the line, it is a total intrusion, and I think that it's in violation of our Constitution.", " Let me tell you that I did not come to my position on abortion very lightly.", "I am a devout Catholic.", "When I was running for Congress 1978 I sat and met with a person I felt very close to, a monsignor currently a bishop.", "I spoke to him about my personal feelings that I would never have an abortion, but I was not quite sure if I were ever to become pregnant as result of a rape if I would be that self-righteous.", "I then spoke to him; he said, Gerry, that's not good enough.", "There you can't support that position.", "I said okay.", "That's my religious view; I will accept the teaching of the church, but I cannot impose my religious views on someone else.", "I truly take an oath as a public official to represent all the people in my district, not only the Catholics.", "If there comes a time where I cannot practice my religion and do my job properly, I will resign my job.", " Well I respect that statement, I really and truly do.", "We have difference on a moral question here on abortion.", "I notice that Mr. Mondale keeps talking in the debate and now it's come here about Mr. Falwell.", "And I don't know where this canard could have come from about Mr. Falwell picking the Supreme Court justices.", "Ronald Reagan has made one super outstanding, the only one he's made, appointment to the Supreme Court and that was Sandra Day O'Connor, and Mr. Falwell opposed her nomination.", "We still have respect for him, but he opposed it, and so I hope this lays to rest this slander against the president.", "We want justices who will interpret the Constitution, not legislate it.", " Yes, I still find it very difficult to believe because in the platform, which this Republican party passed in Dallas - one of the things they was they said that this position on abortion would be a litmus test, not only for Supreme Court justices but for other federal justices.", "That, again, seems to me a blurring of the line of the separation between church and state.", " Let me say to you that I already did that.", "I wanted them to move ahead.", "If you recall, I spent about an hour and 45 minutes speaking to 200 reporters on August 21, which is the day after I was required to file my financial statement, and I sat for as long as they had questions on the issue, and I believe that they were satisfied.", "I filed more information than any other candidate for a national office in the history of this country.", "Not only did I agree to file my tax returns, after a little bit of prodding my husband also agreed to file his with the - not only the ethics committee but the FEC.", "Bur the action that you're speaking about with the ethics committee was started by a right-wing legal organization - foundation - knowing that I would have to - that there would be an automatic inquiry.", "We have filed the necessary papers, I have asked them to move along.", "Unfortunately, the House, I believe, went out of session today, so I don't know if they will move.", "But quite frankly, I would like that to be taken care of anyway, because I just want it cleared up.", " Well, what it showed was that - and it was truly that I hired an accountant who had been with our family for well over forty years.", "He was filling our those ethics forms.", "I did not spend the time with him - I just gave him my tax information and he did it.", "I have to tell you what we have done since I have hired a marvelous accountant.", "I've spent a lot of money having him go through all those ethics forms and he will be doing my taxes over the next eight years while we're in the White House so that the American public can be sure it's all been taken care of.", " What that figure - and I kind of like the way Mrs. Ferraro and Mr. Zaccaro reported - because they reported federal taxes, state and local taxes - gives people a clearer picture.", "That year I happened to pay a lot of state and local taxes, which as you know are deducted from the other, and so I looked it up the other day, and we had paid - I think it's 42 percent - of our gross income in taxes.", "Now Mr. Mondale the other night took what I - I'll be honest - I think it was a cheap shot - at me, and we did a little looking around to see about his.", "We can't find his 198I tax return - it may have been released.", "Maybe my opponent knows whether Mr. Mondale released it.", "But we did find estimates that his income for those three years is a million, four hundred thousand dollars, and I think he paid about the same percentage as I did in total taxes.", "He also made a reference that troubled me very much, Mr. Boyd.", "He started talking about my chauffeur, and you know, I'm driven to work by the Secret Service - so is Mrs. Ferraro - so is Mr. Mondale - they protected his life for four years and now they've done a beautiful job for Barbara and mine.", "They saved the life of the president of the United States.", "I think that was a cheap shot - telling the American people to try to divide class - rich and poor.", "But the big question isn't whether Mrs. Ferraro is doing well.", "I think they're doing pretty well, and I know Barbara and I are doing well.", "And it's darn sure that Mr. Mondale is doing well, with a million four in income, but the question really is - after we get through this disclosure - is the tax cut fair?", "Are people getting a fair break, and the answer is the rich are paying 6 percent more on taxes and the poor are getting a better break.", "Those lower and middle-income people that have borne the burden for a long time.", "So yes, I favor disclosure.", "I've always disclosed.", "This year I had my taxes and everything I own in a blind trust - so blind - blinder than the president's, so I didn't even sign my tax return.", "But there seemed to be an interest in it so we went to the government ethics committee - they agreed to change the trust.", "The trust has been revealed, and I was sure glad to see that I had paid 42 percent of my gross income in taxes.", " I'm really a Texan.", "But I got one house.", "And under the law, every taxpayer is allowed, when he sells a house, and buys another house, to get the rollover.", "Everybody, if it turns out, and I may hire, I notice she said she has a new good accountant.", "I'd like to get his name and phone number because I think I've paid too much in the way of taxes.", "And residence, Mr. Boyd, legal residence, for voting, is very different.", "And the domicile, they call that, very different, than the house.", "That they say you're living in the vice-president's house.", "Therefore you don't get what every - I've got problems - what every other taxpayer gets.", "I got problems with the IRS, but so do a lot of people out there.", "I think I've paid too much.", "Nothing ethical.", "I'd like to get some money back.", " Let me just say that I'd be happy to give the vice-president the name of my accountant, but I warn you, he's expensive.", "I think the question is whether or not the tax cuts and the tax system that's currently in our government, that our government uses, is fair; I think the tax system is unfair.", "But it's not something that we can address in the short term.", "The tax cuts that Vice-President Bush and I got last, three years ago, that this president gave out, no, that's not fair.", "If you earn $200,000 a year, you got a $25,000 tax cut.", "If you earned between $20,000 and $40,000, you may have gotten about $1,000 between ten and twenty, close to a hundred dollars and if you made less than $10,000 with all the budget cuts that came down the line, you suffered a loss of $400.", "That's not fair.", "That's basically unfair and not only is it unfair, but economically it has darn near destroyed this country.", "There's a $750 billion tax cut over a five-year period of time.", "That's one of the reasons we're facing these enormous deficits that we have today.", " No, I think I've said all I want to say.", "I do, I didn't fully address myself to Mr. Boyd's question no disclosure, I led the fight, I think, in 1968, in the House - I was in the House of Representatives for a couple of terms - and I led the fight for disclosure.", "I believe in it.", "Before I went into this job, I disclosed everything we had.", "We didn't have any private corporations, but I disclosed absolutely everything.", "Arthur Andersen made out an assets and liabilities statement that I believe went further than any other one.", "And then, to protect the public interest, we went into this blind trust.", "I believe in the blind trust because I believe a public official in this kind of job ought not to know whether he's gonna benefit, directly or indirectly, by some holding he might have or something of that nature.", "And, no, I support full disclosure.", " Terrorism is very, very difficult to slop.", "And I think everybody knows that.", "We had ambassadors killed in Sudan and the Lebanon some time ago, a long time ago.", "When you see the Israeli building in Lebanon after the death of our marines you see that, hit by terrorism, the Israelis, with all their experience fighting terrorism, you know it's difficult.", "When you see Khomeini wraith his radical Islam resorting to government-sponsored terrorism, it's very difficult.", "The intelligence business can do a good job, and I'm always one that defends the Central Intelligence Agency.", "I believe we ought to strengthen it and I believe we still have the best foreign intelligence business in the world.", "But it is very difficult to get the source information that you need to go after something as shadowy as international terror.", "There was a difference between Iran and what happened in Lebanon.", "In Iran you had a government holding a U.S. embassy; the government sanctioning the takeover of that embassy by those students; the government negotiating with the United States government for their release.", "In Lebanon, in the terror that happened at the embassy, you have the government there, Mr. Gemayel, that wants to help fight against terrorism.", "But because of the melee in the Middle East, it's there today and has been there yesterday and the day before, and everyone that's had experience in that area knows, it is a very different thing.", "So what we've got to do is use absolutely the best security possible.", "I don't think you can go assigning blame.", "The president, of course, is the best I've ever seen at accepting that.", "He's been wonderful about it in absolutely everything that happens.", "But I think fair-minded people that really understand international terror know that it's very hard to guard against.", "And the answer then really lies in the Middle East and terrorism happening all over the world, is a solution to the Palestine question, the follow on to Camp David under the umbrella of the Reagan September of 1982 initiative.", "That will reduce terror, it won't eliminate it.", " What we've done is to support Arab stores that want to stand up against international terror, quite different.", "We believe in supporting, without jeopardizing the security of Israel in any way, because they are our one strategic ally in the area, they are the one democracy in the area and our relations with them has never been better.", "But we do believe in reaching out to the, what they call the GCC, those Gulf Cooperative Council State, those moderate Arab states in that world, and helping them with defensive weapons to guard against international terror or radical Islam perpetuated by Khomeini.", "And because we've done that and because the Saudis chopped down a couple of those intruding airplanes a while back, I think we have helped keep the peace in the Persian Gulf.", " Let me first say that terrorism is a global problem, and let me say secondly that the - Mr. Bush has referred to the embassy that was held in Iran, Well, I was at the White House in January, I guess it was, in '81, when those hostages, all fifty-two of them, came home alive.", "It was at that time that President Reagan gave a speech welcoming them home - as America did, we were so excited to see them back.", "But what he said was: The United States has been embarrassed for the last time.", "We're going to stand tall and if this ever happens again, there's going to be swift and immediate steps taken to address the wrong that our country has founded - has suffered.", "In April of J983 I was in Beirut and visited the ambassador at the embassy.", "Two weeks later, that embassy was bombed.", "At that time - take a look at the crazy activities of terrorists, you can't blame that on anybody.", "They're going to do crazy things and you just don't know what's going to happen.", "The following October, there was another bombing and that bombing took place at the marine barracks, where there were 242 young men who were killed.", "Right after that bombing occurred, there was a commission set up called the Long Commission.", "That commission did a study of the security arrangements around where the marines were sleeping and found that there was negligence, that they did not have proper gates up, proper precautions to stop those trucks from coming in.", "And so the Long Commission issued a report, and President Reagan got up and he said: I'm commander in chief.", "I take responsibility.", "And we all waited for something to be done when he look responsibility.", "Well, last month we had our third bombing, The first time, the first embassy, there was no gate up, The second time, with our Marines, the gate was open.", "The third time, the gate was there but it had not been installed.", "And what was the president's reaction?", "Well, the security arrangements were not in, our people were placed in that embassy in an unsecured time, and the marines who were guarding it were left to go away and there were other people guarding the embassy.", "Again the president said: I assume responsibility.", "I'd like to know what that means.", "Are we going to take proper precautions before we put Americans in situations where they're in danger, or are we just going to walk away, throwing our arms in the air now - quite a reversal from the first time, from the first time when he said he was going to do something?", "Or is this President going to take some action?", " I think they have a legitimate role in gathering information.", "And what has happened was the CIA, in the last bombing, had given information to our administration with reference to the actual threats that that embassy was going to be bombed.", "So it wasn't the CIA that was at fault.", "There's legitimate reason for the CIA to be in existence, and that's to gather intelligence information for our security.", "But when I see the CIA doing things like they're doing down in Central America - supporting a covert war - no, I don't support that kind of activity.", "The CIA is there, it's meant to protect our government; not there to subvert other governments.", " Well, I'm surprised.", "I think I just heard Mrs. Ferraro say that she would do away with all covert actions, and if so, that has very serious ramifications, as the intelligence community knows.", "This is serious business.", "And sometimes it's quiet support for a friend, and so I'll leave that one there.", "But let me help you with the difference, Mrs. Ferraro, between Iran and the embassy in Lebanon.", "Iran - we were held by a foreign government.", "In Lebanon you had a wanton, terrorist action where the government opposed it.", "We went to Lebanon to give peace a chance, to stop the bombing of civilians in Beirut, to remove 13,000 terrorists from Lebanon - and we did.", "We saw the formation of a government of reconciliation and for somebody to suggest, as our two opponents have, that these men died in shame - they better not tell the parents of those young marines.", "They gave peace a chance.", "And our allies were with us - the British, the French, and the Italians.", " Let me just say, first of all, that I almost resent, Vice President Bush, your patronizing attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy.", "I've been a member of Congress for six years; I was there when the embassy was held hostage in Iran, and I have been there and I've seen what has happened in the past several months; seventeen months of your administration.", "Secondly, please don't categorize my answers, either.", "Leave the interpretation of my answers to the American people who are watching this debate.", "And let me say further that no one has ever said that those young men who were killed through the negligence of this administration and others ever died in shame.", "No one who has a child who is nineteen or twenty years old, a son, would ever say that at the loss of anybody else's child.", " I would advocate the use of force when it was necessary to protect the security of our country, protect our security interest or protect our people or protect the interests of our friends and neighbors.", "When president - I'm jumping the gun a bit, aren't I?", "- when Mr. Mondale, Mr. Mondale referred to the quarantine of Central America, a country in Central America, what he is referring to is a last resort after all other means of attempting to settle the situation down in that region of the world had been exhausted.", "Quite frankly now what is being done by this administration is an Americanizing of a regional conflict.", "They're moving in militarily instead of promoting the Contadora process, which, as you know, is the process that is in place with the support of Mexico and Colombia and Panama and Venezuela.", "Instead of supporting the process, our administration has in Nicaragua been supporting covert activities to keep that revolution going in order to overthrow the Sandinista government; in El Salvador was not pushing the head of the government to move toward correction of the civil rights; human rights problems that existed there, and now this administration seems almost befuddled by the fact that Nicaragua is moving to participate in the Contadora process, and El Salvador is, through its President Duarte, is reaching out to the guerrillas in order to negotiate a peace.", "What Fritz Mondale and I feel about the situation down there is that what you do is you deal first through negotiation.", "That force is not a first resort but certainly a last resort in any instance.", " No, I think what you have to do is work with the government - I assume you're speaking about the government of Nicaragua - work with that government to achieve a pluralistic society.", "I mean they do have elections that are coming up on November 4.", "I think we have to work with them to achieve a peaceful solution to bring about a pluralistic country.", "No, I'm not willing to live with a force that could be a danger to our country.", "Certainly, I would see that our country would be there putting all kinds of pressure on the neighboring countries of Honduras, of Costa Rica, of El Salvador, to promote the kind of society that we can all live with and security in this country.", " I support what we're doing.", "It was supported to the Congress and under the law.", "I support it.", "My only regret is that the aid for the contras, those people that are fighting, we call them freedom fighters.", "They want to see the democracy perfected in Nicaragua.", "Am I to understand from this assault on covert action that nowhere in the world would we do something that was considered just off base when Mrs. Ferraro said she's never support it?", "Would she never support it if the violation of human rights was so great and quiet support was necessary for freedom fighters?", "Yes, we're for the contras.", "And let me tell you another fact about the controls.", "Everyone that's not for this, everyone who wants to let that Sandinista government prevail, just like that Castro did, all of that, the contras are not Somozistas.", "Less than 5 percent of the contras supported Somoza.", "These were people that wanted a revolution.", "These people that felt the revolution was betrayed.", "These are people that support human rights.", "Yes, we should support them.", " I spent time in Central America in January and had an opportunity to speak to the contras after the incident in Nicaragua and in El Salvador.", "Let me just say that the situation as it exists now, because of this administration's policies, are not getting better.", "We're not moving toward a more secure area of the world.", "As a matter of fact the number of troops that the Sandinistas have accumulated since the administration started its covert activities has risen from 12,000 to 50,000, and of course the number of Soviet and Cuban advisors has also increased.", "I did not support the mining of the harbors in Nicaragua; it is a violation of international law.", "Congress did not support it and as a matter of fact, just this week, the Congress voted in cut off covert aid to Nicaragua unless and until a request is made and there is evidence of need for it, and the Congress approves it again in March.", "So if Congress doesn't get laid on, the covert activities which I opposed in Nicaragua, those CIA covert activities in that specific country, are not supported by the Congress.", "And believe it or not, not supported by the majority of people throughout the country.", " Well, I would simply like to make the distinction again between those countries that are searching for democracy and the handful of countries that have totally violated human rights and are going the Marxist route.", "Ortega, the commandante who is head of the Nicaraguan Sandinistas, is an avowed Marxist.", "They don't believe in the church.", "They don't believe in free elections.", "They don't believe in all of the values that we believe in.", "So it is our policy to support the democracy there, and when you have freedom fighters that want to protect that revolution, and go the democratic route, we believe in giving them support.", "We are for democracy in the hemisphere.", "We are for negotiations.", "$3 out of every $4 that we sent down there has been for economic aid to support the people's chance to eat and live and be happy and enjoy life.", "And one-fourth only was rnilitary.", "You wouldn't get that from listening to Mr. Mondale.", " Yes, I can.", "The, you mentioned the Gromyko meeting, those were broken off under the Carter-Mondale days.",

willing to talk.", "We are the ones that went to the table in INF.", "We had a good proposal, a moral proposal.", "Ban an entire generation of intermediate nuclear force weapons and if you won't do that, don't leave your allies in Europe in a monopoly position.", "The Soviets with 1,200 of these things, and the alliance with none.", "We didn't think that's the way to deter aggression and keep the peace.", "The president went, the first thing he did when he came into office was make a proposal on the most destabilizing weapons of all, START.", "And when the the strategic weapon and when the Soviets said, well, we don't like that proposal, we said all right, we'll be more flexible.", "I at the urging of the president went to Geneva and laid on the table a treaty to ban all chemical weapons.", "We don't want them to have a monopoly.", "We said look, let's come together.", "You come over here and see what we're doing; we'll go over there and see what you're doing.", "But let's save the kids of this world from chemical weapons.", "A brilliant proposal to get rid of all of them.", "And the Soviets nyet, nyet nyet.", "In the mutual balance force reduction to reduce conventional forces, they're not even willing to tell us the base.", "Mrs. Ferraro knows that, and how many troops they have.", "There's four sessions.", "We have had an agreement with them on the hot line.", "But Carter-Monad made an agreement, the Salt II agreement, but the Democratic Senate, they were a Democratic administration, the Democratic Senate wouldn't even ratify that agreement.", "It was flawed, it was unverifiable and it was not good.", "Our president wants to reduce, not just to stop, he wants to reduce dramatically nuclear weapons.", "And when the Soviets know they're going to have this strong president to deal with, and when this new administration, Mr. Chernenko, given more than a few months in office can solidify its position, then they'll talk.", "But if they think the opposition, before they sit down, are going to give up the MX, give up the B-l, go for a freeze that locks in inferiority in Europe, all of these things, unilaterally, before they're willing to talk, they may just sweat it out for four more weeks.", "Who knows.", " No, I don't think it's winnable.", "I was quoted wrong, obviously, 'cause I never thought that.", "The Soviet planning, I did learn that when I was director of Central Intelligence, and I don't think there'd be any disagreement, is based on that ugly concept.", "But I agree with the president: It should never be fought.", "Nuclear weapons should never be fought with, and that's our approach.", "So, therefore, let's encourage the Soviets to come to the table as we did at the Gromyko meeting.", "I wish everybody could have seen that one - the President, giving the facts to Gromyko in all of these nuclear meetings - excellent, right on top of that subject matter.", "And I'll bet you that Gromyko went back to the Soviet Union saying, \"Hey, listen, this president is calling the shots; we'd better move.\"", "But do you know why I think we'll get an agreement?", "Because I think it is in the interest of the Soviet Union to make it, just as it is in the United States.", "They're not deterred by rhetoric.", "I listened to the rhetoric for two years at the United Nations.", "I've lived in a Communist country.", "It's not rhetoric that decides agreements, it's self-interest of those countries.", " Let me say first of all that I don't think there is any issue that is more important in this campaign, in this election, than the issue of war and peace.", "And since today is Eleanor Roosevelt's 100th birthday, let me quote her.", "She said, \"It is not enough to want peace, you must believe in it.", "And it is not enough to believe in it, you must work for it.\"", "This administration's policies have indicated quite the opposite.", "The last time I heard Vice President Bush blame the fact that they didn't meet with the Soviet leader, and this is the first president in forty years not to meet with a Soviet counterpart.", "He said the reason was because there are three Soviet leaders in the past three and a half years.", "I went and got a computer printout.", "It's five pages of the leaders, world leaders, that the Soviet leaders have met with, and they're not little people.", "They're people like Mitterrand of France and Kohl of Germany and President Kiprianou of Cyprus - you go down the list, five pages of people that the Soviet leaders have managed to meet with and somehow they couldn't meet with the president of the United States.", "In addition to not meeting with his Soviet counterpart, this is the first president - and you're right - since the start of negotiating arms control agreements who have not negotiated an arms control agreement, But not only has he not negotiated one, he's been opposed to every single one that every other president has negotiated, including Eisenhower, including Ford, and including Nixon.", "Now, let me just say that with reference to the vice-president's comments about the intent and the desire of the United Sites and this administration, the Soviet Union did walk out of the talks.", "I agree.", "But it seems to me in 1982, when the administration presented its Start proposal, that it wasn't a realistic proposal.", "And that is the comment that was made by Secretary Haig after he left office, because what it dealt with was that it dealt just with land-based nuclear missiles, which is where the Soviets had the bulk of their missiles.", "But that aside, in 1982, I believe it was, their own negotiator, Nitze, came out with a proposal called the \"walk-in-the-woods proposal\" which would have limited the number of nuclear arms in Europe.", "That proposal was turned down by the administration - a proposal presented by its own administrator.", "Now I'm delighted that they met with Mr. Gromyko, but they could have had that opportunity to meet with him in 1981 when he came to the UN, which he had done with every other president before, and in 1982 as well.", "I guess my -", " Well, I think there's quite a difference between Mr. Kyprianou in Cyprus and the leader of the free world, Ronald Reagan, in terms of meeting.", "And the Soviet Union - the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will meet with a lot of different people.", "We've been in very close touch with Mr. Mitterrand, Mr. Kohl, and others that have met with the leaders of the Soviet Union.", "But that's quite different than meeting with the president of the United States.", "The Soviets say we'll have a meeting when we think there can be progress and yet they left those talks.", "I'd like to correct my opponent on the walk in the woods.", "It was the Soviet Union that was unwilling to discuss the walk in the woods.", "They were the ones that gunned it down first and the record is very, very clear on that.", "Miss Ferraro mentioned the inflexibility of our position on strategic arms.", "Yes, we offered first to get rid of all those - we tried to reduce the SS-18's and those weapons.", "But then we said if that's not good enough, there is flexibility, let's talk about the bombers and planes.", "So that's a very important point in terms of negotiation.", " I - You robbed me of my follow-up, that's what you robbed me, so why don't I let her give me the follow-up.", " I think first of all, you have to take a look at the current situation.", "We now have 50,000 nuclear warheads; we are building at the rate of five or six a day between us and we have been doing that since this administration came into office.", "I think what you can do is look at what they've done and recognize that they're not going to do very much in the future.", "And so, since they've done nothing, do we continue to build because an arms race doesn't lead to anything, it leads to another arms race and that's that.", "Vice President Monad has indicated that what he would do, first of all, as soon as he.", "gets into office, is contact his Soviet counterpart and set up an annual summit meeting.", "That's number one.", "I don't think you can start negotiating until you start talking.", "Secondly, he would issue a challenge, and the challenge would be in the nature of temporary, mutual, verifiable, moratoria to halt testing in the air, in the atmosphere, that would respond with a challenge from the Soviet Union, we hope, to sit down and negotiate a treaty.", "That was done in 1960.", "I don't know what your lights are doing, Sander.", " Okay.", "I'm watching them blinking.", "So I have another minute.", "What that would do is it would give us the opportunity to sit down and negotiate a treaty.", "That was done in 1960 by President Kennedy - in 1963.", "What he did was he issued a challenge to the Soviet Union.", "He said we will not test in space - in the atmosphere, if you will not.", "They did not.", "In two months they sat down and they negotiated a treaty.", "We do not now have to worry about that type of testing.", " it will be done, if only you have the will to do it.", "Again, remember it is mutual; it is verifiable and it is a challenge that once that challenge is not met, if testing were to resume, then we would continue testing as well.", " Are you saying that I would have to have fought in the war in order to love peace?", " All right.", "I think what happens is when you try to equate whether or not I have had military experience, that's the natural conclusion.", "It's about as valid as saying that you would have to be black in order to despise racism, that you'd have to be female in order to be terribly offended by sexism.", "And that's just not so.", "I think if you take a look at where I've been, both in the Congress and where I intend to go, the type of person I am - I think that the people of this country can rely upon the fact that I will be a lender.", "I don't think the Soviet Union for one minute can sit down and make determination on what I will do if I'm ever in a position to have to do something with reference to the Soviet Union.", "Quite frankly I'm prepared to do whatever is necessary in order to secure this country and make sure that security is maintained.", "Secondly, if the Soviet Union were to ever believe that they could challenge the United States with any sort of nuclear forces or otherwise, if I were in a position of leadership in this country, they would be assured that they would be met with swift, concise and certain retaliation.", "Let me just say one other thing now.", "The most important thing, though I think as a leader that what one has to do is get to the point where you're not put into that position.", "And the way you to that position of rnoving away from having to make a decision - armed force or anything else - is by moving toward arms control.", "And that's not what's been done over the past four years.", "I think that if you were to take a look at the failures of this administration that would have to be number one.", "I will not put myself in that position as a leader in this country.", "I will move immediately toward arms control negotiations.", " Oh, I don't have a single-most question.", "I guess the concern that I have is a concern not only as a vice-presidential candidate but as a citizen in this country.", "My concern is that we are not doing anything to stop the arms race, and if seems to me that if we keep talking about military inferiority - which we do not have, we are at a comparable level with the Soviet Union; our Joint Chiefs of Staff have said they'd never exchange our military power for theirs.", "I guess the thing that I'd want is a commitment that pretty soon they're going to do something about making this a safer world for all of us.", " No, I think his strategy not only was correct but is correct.", "You've got to go back where we were.", "Clearly, when we came into office, the American people recognized that we had slipped into positions of inferiority on various things.", "Some of our planes, as the president points out, were older than the pilots; ships that couldn't go out to sea.", "And you had a major problem with the military.", "Actually, the morale wasn't very good either.", "So we have had to strengthen the military and we're well on the way to getting that job done.", "America is back in terms of military strength, in terms of our ability to deter aggression and keep the peace.", "At the same time, however, we have made proposals and proposals and proposals - sound proposals - on reducing nuclear weapons.", "The Strategic Arms Reduction Talks were good proposals, and it's the Soviets who left the table.", "The Intermediate Nuclear Force Talks were sound talks, and I wish the Soviet Union had continued them.", "The chemical weapon treaty to ban all chemical weapons, it was our initiative, not the Soviets.", "And we wish they would think anew and move forward to verification so everybody would know whether the other side was keeping its word.", "But, much more important, you'd reduce the level of terror.", "Similarly, we're reducing - trying to talk to them, and are talking to them, in Vienna, about conventional force reduction.", "We've talked to them about human rights.", "I've met with Mr. Andropov and Mr. Chernenko, and we mention and we try to do something about the human rights question.", "The suppression of Soviet Jews is absolutely intolerable and so we have to keep pushing forward on the moral grounds as well as on the arms reduction ground.", "But it is my view that because this president has been strong, and because we've addressed the imbalances - and I think we're very close to getting that job done - the Soviets are more likely to make a deal.", "The Soviets made an ABM treaty when they felt we were going to deploy an ABM system.", "So I am optimistic for the future, once they realize that they will have this strong, principled president to negotiate with, strong leadership, and yet with demonstrable flexibility on arms control.", " I have none I'd like to ask of her, but I'd sure like to use the time to talk about the World Series or something of that nature.", "Let me put it this way - I don't have any questions, but we are so different from - the Reagan-Bush administration is so different from the Carter-Mondale [sic] administration that the American people are going to have the clearest choice.", "It's a question of going back to the failed ideas of the past, where we came in - 21% percent on those interest rates, inflation, despair, malaise, no leadership, blaming the American people for failed leadership.", "Or another option - keep this recovery going until it benefits absolutely everybody.", "Peace at home - peace abroad - prosperity - opportunity.", "I'd like to hear her talk on those things, but I think the yellow light is flashing and so we'll leave it there.", " I think the vice-president's comment about the Carter-Mondale administration really typifies this administration.", "It's an administration that looks backwards, not forwards and into the future.", "I must say that I'm also tickled by their comments on human rights.", "The Soviet Union in 1979 allowed 51,000 people to emigrate, because, in large measure, this administration's policies over the past four years, 1,313 people got out of the Soviet Union in 1983 and 1984.", "That's not a great record on human rights and certainly not a record on human rights achievements.", "This administration spent a trillion dollars on defense, but it hasn't gotten a trillion dollars on national security.", " No rebuttal.", " Well, in a couple of weeks, you, the American people, will be faced, three weeks, with a choice.", "It's the clearest choice in some fifty years.", "And the choice is, do we move forward with strength and with prosperity or do we go back to weakness, despair, disrespect.", "Ronald Reagan and I have put our trust in the American people.", "We've moved some of the power away from Washington, D.C., and put it back with the people.", "We're pulling together.", "The neighborhoods are safer 'cause crime is going down.", "Your sons and daughters are doing better in school.", "Test scores are going up.", "There's a new opportunity lying out there in the future.", "Science, technology and space offering opportunity that, to everybody, all the young ones coming up.", "And abroad there's new leadership and respect.", "And Ronald Reagan is clearly the strong leader of the free world.", "And I'll be honest with you.", "It's a joy to serve with a president who does not apologize for the United States of America.", "Mr. Mondale, on the other hand, has one idea.", "Go out and tax the American people.", "And then he wants to repeal indexing, to wipe out the one protection that those at the lowest end of the economic scale have protecting them against being rammed into higher and higher tax brackets.", "We just owe our country too much to go back to that kind of an approach.", "I'd like to say something to the young people.", "I started a business.", "I know what it is to have a dream and have a job and work hard to employ others and really to participate in the American dream.", "Some of you out there are finishing high school or college and some of you are starting out in the working place.", "And we want for you America's greatest gift.", "And that is opportunity.", "And then, peace.", "Yes, I did serve in combat.", "I was shot down when I was a young kid, scared to death.", "And all that did, saw friends die, but that heightened my convictions about peace.", "It is absolutely essential that we guarantee the young people that they will not know the agony of war.", "America's gift, opportunity and peace.", "Now we do have some unfinished business.", "We must continue to go ahead.", "The world is too complex to go back to vacillation and weakness.", "We've too much going on to go back to the failed policies of the past.", "The future is too bright not to give it our best shot.", "Together we can go forward and lift America up to meet her greatest dreams.", "Thank you very much.", " I hope somebody wants to applaud.", "Being the candidate for vice-president of my party is the greatest honor I have ever had.", "But it's not only a personal achievement for Geraldine Ferraro - and certainly not only the bond that I feel as I go across this country with women throughout the country.",

Allen family who live next door to a toxic dump and they're very, very concerned about the fact that those toxics are seeping into the water that they and their neighbors drink.", "Now those people love this country and they're patriotic.", "But it's not the patriotism that you're seeing in the commercials as you watch television these days.", "Their patriotism is not only a pride in the country as it is, but a pride in this country that is strong enough to meet the challenges of the future.", "Do you know when we find jobs for the eight and a half million people who are unemployed in this country, you know we'll make our economy stronger and that will be a patriotic act.", "When we reduce the deficits and we cut interest rates, and I know the president doesn't believe that, but it's so - we cut those interest rates young people can buy houses, that's pro-family and that will be a patriotic act.", "When we educate our children - good Lord, they're going to be able to compete in a world economy and that makes us stronger and that's a patriotic act.", "When we stop the arms race, we make this a safer, saner world, and that's a patriotic act, and when we keep the peace young men

man who could not afford to get justice because he couldn't afford a lawyer; when he was in the Senate he fought for child nutrition programs, he wrote the Fair Housing Act, he even investigated the
