matter of fact, uh - I've never advocated any cut of $15 billion in our defense budget.", "As a matter of fact, Mr. Ford has made a political football out of the defense budget.", "About a year ago he

time that uh - I submitted the Sinai agreement to the Congress of the United States, I submitted every single document that was applicable to the Sinai II agreement.", "It was the most complete documentation by any president of any agreement signed by a president on behalf of the United States.", "Now as far as meeting with the Congress is concerned, during the twenty-four months that I've

appeared in the several years that he's been the secretary before eighty different uh - committee hearings in the House and in the Senate.", "The secretary of state has made better than fifty speeches

sales have been a benefit to American agriculture.", "We have achieved a five and three quarter year uh - sale of a minimum six million metric tons, which means that they have already bought about four million metric tons this year and are bound to buy another two million metric tons to take the grain and corn and wheat that the American farmers have produced in order to uh - have full production.", "It just isn't true.", "And if Mr. Carter alleges that His Holiness by signing that has done it, he is totally inaccurate.", "Number one, we have an agreement where they notify us and we

themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.", "I don't believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.", "As a matter of fact, I visited Poland, Yugoslavia and Rumania to make certain that the people of those countries understood that the president of the United States and the people of the United are dedicated to their independence, their autonomy and their freedom.", "I was talking about Mr. Ford.", "The uh - fact is that secrecy has surrounded the decisions made by the Ford administration.", "We also have seen Mr. Ford exclude himself from access to the public.", "He hasn't had a tough cross-examination-type press conference in over thirty days.", "One press conference he had without sound.", "He's also shown a weakness in yielding to pressure.", "The Soviet Union, for instance, put pressure on Mr. Ford and he refused to see a symbol of human freedom recognized around the world, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.", "The Arabs have put pressure on Mr. Ford, and he's yielded, and has permitted a boycott by the Arab countries of American businesses who trade with Israel, or who have American Jews owning or taking part in the management of American - companies.",

with the Soviet Union in '72 was terrible, and Mr. Ford made up for it with three embargoes, one against our own ally in Japan.", "That's not the way to run our foreign policy, including international trade.", " I would never single out food as a trade embargo item.", "If I ever decided to impose an embargo because of a crisis in international relationships, it would include all shipments of all equipment.", "I would not ship that Arab country anything - no weapons, no spare parts for weapons, no oil-drilling rigs, no oil pipe, no nothing.", "I wouldn't single out just food.", "When this Republican administration came into office we were shipping about $1 billion worth of arms overseas, now ten to twelve billion dollars worth of arms overseas to countries that quite often use these weapons to fight each other.", "Under the last Democratic administration 60 percent of all weapons that went into the Middle East were for Israel.", "Nowadays - 75 percent were for Israel before.", "Now 60 percent go to the Arab countries, and this does not include Iran.", "If you include Iran, our present shipment of weapons to the Middle East, only 20 percent goes to Israel.", "This is a deviation from idealism; it's a deviation from a commitment to our major ally in the Middle East, which is Israel; it's a yielding to economic pressure on the part of the Arabs on the oil issue; and it's also a tremendous indication that under the Ford administration we have not addressed the energy policy adequately.", "We still have no comprehensive energy policy in this country.", "And it's an overall sign of weakness.", "It would've been inconceivable ten - fifteen years ago, for us to be brought to our knees with an Arab oil embargo.", "But it was done three years ago and they're still putting pressure on us from the Arab countries to our discredit around the world.", "It's a matter of being tough.", "It's a matter of being strong.", "It's a matter of being consistent.", "Our priorities ought to be first of all to meet our own military needs, secondly to meet the needs of our allies and friends, and only then should we ship military equipment to foreign countries.", "As a matter of fact, Iran is gonna get eighty F-14s before we even meet our own Air Force orders for F-l4s.", "And the shipment of Spruance-class destroyers to Iran are much more highly sophisticated than the Spruance-class destroyers that are present being delivered to our own Navy.", "This is ridiculous and it ought to be changed.", "And I would make sure that the uh - Saudis understood this ahead of time so there would be no doubt in their mind.", "I think under those circumstances they would refrain from pushing us to our knees as they did in 1973 with their previous oil embargo.", " Governor Carter uh - apparently doesn't realize that since I've been president we have sold to the Israelis over $4 billion in military hardware.", "We have made available to the Israelis over 45 percent of the total economic and military aid since the establishment of Israel twenty-seven years ago.", "So the Ford administration has done a good job in helping our good ally, Israel, and we're dedicated to the survival and security of Israel.", "I believe that Governor Carter doesn't realize the need and necessity for arms sales to Iran.", "Iran is bordered very extensively by the Soviet Union.", "Iran has Iraq as one of its neighbors.", "The Soviet Union and the Communist-dominated government of Iraq are neighbors of Iran, and Iran is an ally of the United States.", "It's my strong feeling that we ought to sell arms to Iran for its own national security, and as an ally - a strong ally of the United States.", "The history of our relationship with Iran goes back to the days of President Truman when he decided that it was vitally necessary for our own security as well as that of Iran, that we should help that country, and Iran has been a good ally.", "In 1973 when there was an oil embargo, Iran did not participate.", "Iran continued to sell oil to the United States.", "I believe that it's in our interest and in the interest of Israel and Iran, and Saudi Arabia, for the United States to sell arms to those countries.", "It's for their security as well as ours.", " Our relationship with the People's Republic of China is based upon the Shanghai Communique, of 1972, and that communique, calls for the normalization of relations between the United States and the People's Republic.", "It doesn't set a times schedule.", "It doesn't uh - make a determination as to how uh - that relationship should be achieved in relationship to our current uhh - diplomatic recognition and obligations to the Taiwanese Government.", "The Shanghai Communique, does say that the differences between the People's Republic on the one hand and Taiwan on the other shall be settled by peaceful means.", "The Ford administration will not let down, will not eliminate or forget our obligation to the people of Taiwan.", "We feel that there must be a continued obligation to the people, the some nineteen or twenty million people in Taiwan.", " There is no policy of this government to give to the People's Republic, or to sell to the People's Republic of China, military equipment.", "I do not believe that we, the United States, should sell, give or otherwise transfer military hardware to the People's Republic of China, or any other Communist nation, such as the Soviet Union and the like.", "As a matter of fact, during this current year uh we are shipping Iran, or have contracted to ship to Iran, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms and also to Saudi Arabia, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms.", "Also in 1975, we almost brought Israel to their knees after the uh - Yom Kippur War by the so-called reassessment of our relationship to Israel.", "We in effect tried to make Israel the scapegoat for the problems in the Middle East.", "And this weakened our relationships with Israel a great deal and put a cloud on the total commitment that our people feel toward the Israelis.", "In the Far East I think we need to continue to be uh - strong and uh - I would certainly uh - pursue the uh - normalization of uh - relationships with the People's Republic of China.", "We opened a great opportunity in l972, which has pretty well been frittered - frit- frittered away under Mr. Ford, that ought to be a constant uh - inclination toward - uh - toward friendship.", "But I would never let that friendship with the People's Republic of China stand in the way of the preservation of the independence and freedom of the people on Taiwan.", " Well, always in the past we've had an ability to have a strong defense and also have - to have a strong uh - domestic economy, and also to be strong in our reputation and influence within the community of nations.", "These uh - characteristics of our country have been endangered under Mr. Ford.", "We're no longer respected in a showdown vote in the United Nations or in - in any other international council we're lucky to get 20 percent of the other nations to vote with us.", "Our allies feel that we've neglected them.", "Under this administration we've also had an inclination to keep separate the European countries, thinking that if they are separate, then we can dominate them and proceed with our secret, Lone Ranger-type diplomatic efforts.", "I would uh - also like to point out that we, in this country, have let our economy go down the drain.", "The worst inflation since the Great Depression.", "The highest unemployment of any developed nation of the world.", "We have a higher unemployment rate in this country than Great Britain, and West Germany.", "Our unemployment rate is twice as high as it is in Italy; it's three or four times as high as it is - as it is in Japan.", "And that terrible circumstance in this country is exported overseas.", "We comprise about 30 percent of the world's economic trade power influence.", "And when we're weak at home - weaker than all our allies - that weakness weakens the whole free world.", "So strong economy is very important.", "Another thing that we need to do is to reestablish the good relationships that we ought to have between the United States and our natural allies and friends.", "They have felt neglected.", "But I can guarantee it will not come if Gerald Ford is reelected and this present policy is continued; it will come if I'm elected.", " Well let me say very quickly that under President Johnson, in spite of the massive investment in the Vietnam War, he turned over a balanced budget to Mr. Nixon.", "The unemployment rate was less than 4 percent.", "The inflation rate under Kennedy and Johnson was about 2 percent - one-third what it is under this administration.", "So we did have at that time with good management, the ability to do both.", "I don't think that anybody can say that Johnson and Kennedy neglected the poor and the destitute people in this country or around the world.", " The number one responsibility of any president, above all else, is to guarantee the security of our nation - an ability to be free of the threat of attack, or blackmail and to carry out our obligations to our allies and friends, and to carry out a legitimate foreign policy.", "They must go hand in hand, but the security of this nation has got to come first.", " Let me say very categorically you cannot maintain the security of the United States with the kind of defense budget cuts that Governor Carter has indicated.", "In 1975 he wanted to cut the budget $15 billion.", "He's now down to a figure of five to seven billion dollars.", "Reductions of that kind will not permit the United States to be strong enough to deter aggression and maintain the peace.", "Governor Carter apparently doesn't know the facts.", "As soon as I became president, I initiated a meeting with the NATO heads of state and met with them in Brussels to discuss how we could improve the re- defense relationship in Western Europe.", "In uh - November of 1975 I met with the leaders of the five industrial nations in France for the purpose of seeing what we could do acting together to meet the problems of uh - the coming recession.", "In Puerto Rico this year, I met with six of the leading industrial nations' heads of state to meet the problem of inflation so we would be able to solve it before it got out of hand.", "I have met with the heads of government bilaterally as well as multilaterally.", "Our relations with Japan have never been better.", "I was the first United States president to visit Japan.", "And we uh - had the emperor of Japan here this uh - past year and the net result is Japan and the United States are working more closely together now than at any time in the history of our relationship.", "Just recently, President Rabin said that our relations were never better.", "Uh - Mr. Brezhnev and I met in Vladivostok in December of 1974 for the purpose of trying to take the initial step so we could have a SALT II agreement that would go to l985.", "As I indicated earlier, we did agree on a twenty-four-hundred limitation on uh - uh - launchers of ballistic missiles.", "Uh - that would mean a cutback in the Soviet program; it would not interfere with our own program.", "At the same time, we put a limitation of thirteen hundred and twenty on MIRVs.", "Our technicians have been working since that time in Geneva, trying to put into technical language a - an agreement that can be verified by both parties.", "In the meantime, there has developed the problem of the Soviet Backfire - their high-performance aircraft which they say is not a long-range aircraft and which some of our people say is a intercontinental aircraft.", "In the interim, there has been the development on our part primarily, the cruise missiles; cruise missiles that could be launched from land-based mobile installations; cruise missiles that could be launched - launched from high-performance aircraft, like the B-52s or the B-1s, which I hope we proceed with; cruise missiles which could be launched from either surface or submarine uh - naval vessels.", "Those gray-area weapons systems are creating some problems in a - the agreement for a SALT II negotiation.", "But I can say that I am dedicated to proceeding, and I met just last week with the foreign minister of the Soviet Union, and he indicated to me that uh - the Soviet Union was interested in narrowing the differences and making a realistic and a sound compromise.", "Because if we do not and SALT I expires on October three, 1977, you will unleash again an all-out nuclear arms race with the potential of a nuclear holocaust of unbelievable dimensions.", "So it's the obligation of the president to do just that, and I intend to do so.", " I believe that the cruise missiles which we are now developing in research and development across the spectrum from air, from the sea, or from the land, uh - can be uh - included within a SALT II agreement.", "They are a new weapons system that has a great potential, both conventional and nuclear armed.", "At the same time, we have to make certain that the Soviet Union's Backfire, which they claim is not an intercontinental aircraft and which some of our people contend is, must also be included if we are to get the kind of agreement which is in the best interest of both countries.", "And I really believe that it - it's far better for us and for the Soviet Union, and more importantly for the people around the world, that these two superpowers find an answer for a SALT II agreement before October three, 1977.", "I think good will on both parts, hard bargaining by both parties and a reasonable compromise will be in the best interests of all parties.", " Well, Mr. Ford acts like he's uh - running for president for the first time.", "He's been in office two years, and there has been absolutely no progress made toward a new SALT agreement.", "He has learned the date of the expiration of SALT I, apparently.", "As a nuclear engineer myself, I know the limitations and capabilities of atomic power.", "I advocated last May in a speech at the United Nations that we move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear devices, both weapons and peaceful devices; that we not ship any more atomic fuel to a country that refuses to comply with strict controls over the waste which can be reprocessed into explosives.", "I've also advocated that we stop the sale by Germany and France of - processing plants for Pakistan and Brazil.", "Mr. Ford hasn't moved on this.", "We also need to provide an adequate supply of enriched uranium.", "Mr. Ford, again, under pressure from the atomic energy lobby, has insisted that this reprocessing or rather re-en- enrichment be done by private industry and not by the existing uh - government uh - plants.", "This kind of confusion and absence of leadership has let us drift now for two years with a constantly increasing threat of atomic weapons throughout the world.", "We now have five nations that have atomic bombs that we know about.", "If we continue under Mr. Ford's policy by 1985 or '90 we'll have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons.", "This has got to be stopped.", "That is one of the major challenges and major undertakings that I will assume as the next president.", " No, it's not just campaign rhetoric.", "I think that militarily we are as strong as any nation on earth.", "I think we got to stay that way and continue to increase our capabilities to meet any potential threat.", "Also, we'll never be strong again overseas, unless we're strong at home.", "And with our economy in such terrible disarray and getting worse by the month.", "We've got five-hundred thousand more Americans unemployed today than we had three months ago.", "We've got two and a half million more Americans out of work now than we had when Mr. Ford took office.", "This kind of deterioration in our economic strength is bound to weaken us around the world.", "And we not only have uh problems at home but we export those problems overseas.", "Potentially we're strong.", "Under this administration that strength has not been realized.", " Governor Carter uh - brags about the unemployment during Democratic administrations and condemns the unemployment at the present time.", "I must remind him that we're at peace and during the period that he brags about unemployment being low, the United States was at war.", "I have recommended to the Congress that we develop the uranium enrichment plant at Portsmouth, Ohio, which is a publicly owned - U.S. government facility and have indicated that the private program which would follow on in Alabama is one that may or may not uhh - be constructed.", "But I am committed to the one at Portsmouth, Ohio.", "The foreign policy of the United States meets the highest standards of morality.", "The Ford administration wants to eradicate hunger and disease in our underdeveloped countries throughout the world.", "Those are initiatives in foreign policy which are of the highest moral standard and that is indicative of the foreign policy of this country.", " I believe that uh - our foreign policy must express the highest standards of morality.", "And the initiatives that we took in southern Africa are the best examples of what this administration is doing and will continue to do in the next four years.", "If the United States had not moved when we did in southern Africa, there's no doubt there would have been an acceleration of bloodshed in that tragic part of the world.", "If we had not taken our initiative, it's very, very possible that uh - the government of Rhodesia would have been overrun and that the Soviet Union and the Cubans would have dominated uh - southern Africa.", "And I believe that we used our skill.", "Secretary of State Kissinger has done a superb job in working with the black African nations, the so-called front-line nations.", "He has done a superb job in getting the prime minister of South Africa, Mr. Vorster, to agree that the time had come for a solution to the problem of Rhodesia.", "Secretary Kissinger, in his meeting with uh - Prime Minister Smith of Rhodesia, was able to convince him that it was in the best interests of whites as well as blacks in Rhodesia to find an answer for a transitional government and then a majority government.", "This is a perfect example of the kind of leadership that the United States, under this administration, has taken.", "There've been more disputes in its area where there's more volatility than any other place in the world.", "But because Arab nations and the Israelis trust the United States, we were able to take the lead in the Sinai II Agreement.", "And I can assure you that the United States will have the leadership role in moving toward a comprehensive settlement of the Middle Eastern problems, I hope and trust as soon as possible.", "And we will do it with the highest moral principles.", "I have personally told President Pack that the United States does not condone the kind of repressive measures that he has taken in that country.", "But I think in all fairness and equity we have to recognize the problem that South Korea has.", "South Korea faces a very delicate situation.", "Now the United States, in this case, this administration, has recommended a year ago and we have reiterated it again this year, that the United States, South Korea, North Korea and the uh - People's Republic of China sit down at a conference table to resolve the problems of the Korean peninsula.", "This is a leadership role that the United States under this administration is carrying out, and if we do it, and I think the opportunities and the possibilities are getting better, we will have solved many of the internal domestic problems that exist in South Korea at the present time.", " I notice that Mr. Ford didn't comment on the uh - prisons in Chile.", "This is an - a typical example, maybe of many others, where this administration overthrew an elected government and helped to establish a military dictatorship.", "This has not been an ancient history story.", "Last year under Mr. Ford, of all the Food for Peace that went to South America, 85 percent went to the military dictatorship in Chile.", "He says we have to move from one area of the world to another.", "While the secretary of state's in one country, there are almost a hundred and fifty others that are wondering what we're gonna do next, what will be the next secret agreement.", "We don't have a comprehensive understandable foreign policy that deals with world problems or even regional problems.", "Karl Marx said that the free enterprise system in a democracy can only continue to exist when they are at war or preparing far war.", "Karl Marx was the grandfather of Communism.", "I don't agree with that statement.", "I hope Mr. Ford doesn't either.", "And the last thing I wanna make is this.", "We were peaceful when Mr. Ford went into office.", " Well, here again, uh - the Panamanian question is one that's been confused by Mr. Ford.", "Uh - he had directed his uh - diplomatic relation - uh - uh - representative to yield to the Panamanians full sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone at the end of a certain period of time.", "I would never give up complete control or practical control of the Panama Canal Zone, but I would continue to negotiate with the Panamanians.", "We retained control as though we had sovereignty.", "Now I would be willing to go ahead with negotiations.", "I believe that we could share more fully responsibilities for the Panama Canal Zone with Panama.", "I would be willing to continue to raise the payment for shipment of goods through the Panama Canal Zone.", "I might even be willing to reduce to some degree our military emplacements in the Panama Canal Zane, but I would not relinquish practical control of the Panama Canal Zane any time in the foreseeable future.", " The United States must and will maintain complete access to the Panama Canal.", "The United States must maintain a defense capability of the Panama Canal.", "And the United States will maintain our national security interest in the Panama Canal.", "The negotiations far the Panama Canal started under President Johnson and have continued up to the present time.", "I believe those negotiations should continue.", "But there are certain guidelines that must be followed, and I've just defined them.", " The White House did not uh - prevent the release of that report.", "On July twelfth of this year, we gave full permission for the release of that report.", "I was very disappointed in the fact that the uh - GAO released that report because I think it interjected political partisan politics at the present time.", "And I can assure you that if we had not taken the strong and forceful action that we did, we would have been uh - criticized very, very uh - severely for sitting back and not moving.", "Captain Miller is thankful.", "The crew is thankful.", "We did the right thing.", "It seems to me that those who sit in Washington eighteen months after the incident are not the best judges of the decision-making process that had to be made by the National Security Council and by myself at the time the incident was developing in the Pacific.", "We made uh - diplomatic uh - protests to the Cambodian government through the United Nations.", "Every possible diplomatic means was utilized.", "But at the same time, I had a responsibility, and so did the National Security Coun- Council, to meet the problem at hand.", " Well, I'm reluctant to uh comment on the recent report - I haven't read it.", "I think the American people have only one - uh requirement - that the facts about Mayaguez be given to them accurately and completely.", "Mr. Ford has been there for eighteen months.", "He had the facts that were released today immediately after the Mayaguez incident.", "I understand that the report today is accurate.", "Mr. Ford has said, I believe, that it was accurate, and that the White House made no attempt to block the issuing of that report.", "I don't know if that's exactly accurate or not.", "I understand that both the - the uh - Department of State and the Defense Department have approved the accuracy of today's report, or yesterday's report, and also the National Security Agency.", "I don't know what was right, or what was wrong, or what was done.", "The only thing I believe is that whatever the - the knowledge was that Mr. Ford had should have been given to the American people eighteen months ago, immediately after the Mayaguez uh - incident occurred.", "This is uh - what the American people want.", "When something happens that endangers our security, or when something happens that threatens our stature in the world, or when American people are endangered by the actions of a foreign country, uh - just forty uh sailors on the Mayaguez, we obviously have to move aggressively and quickly to rescue them.", "But then after the immediate action is taken, I believe the president has an obligation to tell the American people the truth and not wait eighteen months later for the report to be issued.", "This is the first time that I've - remember in the history of our country when we've let a foreign country circumvent or change our Bill of Rights.", "I'll do everything I can as president to stop the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries.", "And I don't believe that Arab countries will pursue it when we have a strong president who will protect the integrity of our country, the commitment of our Constitution and Bill of Rights and protect people in this country who happen to be Jews.", "It may later be Catholics; it may be - later be Baptists who are threatened by some foreign country.", "But we ought to stand staunch.", "And I think it's a disgrace that so far Mr. Ford's administration has blocked the passage of legislation that would've revealed by law every instance of the boycott and it would've prevented the boycott from continuing.", " Again Governor Carter is inaccurate.", "The Arab boycott action was first taken in 1952.", "And in November of 1975 I was the first president to order the executive branch to take action, affirmative action, through the Department of Commerce and other cabinet departments, to make certain that no American businessman or business organization should discriminate against Jews because of an Arab boycott.", "And I might add that uh - my administration - and I'm very proud of it - is the first administration that has taken an antitrust action against companies in this country that have allegedly cooperated with the Arab boycott.", "Just on Monday of this week I signed a tax bill that included an amendment that would prevent companies in the United States from taking a tax deduction if they have in any way whatsoever cooperated with the Arab boycott.", "And last week when we were trying to get the Export Administration Act through the Congress - necessary legislation - my administration went to Capitol Hill and tried to convince the House and the Senate that we should have an amendment on that legislation which would take strong and effective action against those who uh - participate or cooperate with the Arab uh boycott.", "If they do give us a bona fide, complete uh - accounting of the eight hundred MIA's, then I believe that the United States should begin negotiations for the uh - admission of Vietnam to the United Nations.", "But not until they have given us the full accounting of our MIAs.", " One of the uh - most embarrassing uh - failures of the Ford administration, and one that touches specifically on human rights, is his refusal to appoint a presidential commission to go to Vietnam, to go to Laos, to go to Cambodia and try to trade for the release of information about those who are missing in action in those wars.", "So far, Mr. Ford has not done it.", "We've had several fragmentary efforts by members of the Congress and by - by private citizens.", "Several months ago the Vietnam government said, \"We are ready to sit down and negotiate for release of information on MIAs.", "So far, Mr. Ford has not responded.", "I would never normalize relationships with Vietnam, nor permit them to join the United Nations until they've taken this action.", "But that's not enough.", " The purpose of this debate and the outcome of the election will determine three basic things: Leadership, upholding the principles of our country, and proper priorities and commitments for the future.", "This election will also determine what kind of world we leave our children.", "I believe we can and we ought to.", "Now we've been hurt in recent years in this country.", "In the aftermath of Vietnam, Cambodia, Chile, Pakistan, Angola, Watergate, CIA, we've been hurt.", "Our people feel that we've lost something precious.", "I wanna see our nation - return to a posture and an image and a standard to make us proud once again.", "I remember the world with NATO, and the world of Point Four, and the world of the Marshall Plan, and the world of the Peace Corps.", "We ought to be a beacon for nations who search for peace and who search for freedom, who search for individual liberty, who search for basic human rights.", "We haven't been lately.", "We can be once again.", "We'll never have that world leadership until we are strong at home, and we can have that strength if we return to the basic principles.", "It ought not to be a strength of bombast and threats.", "It ought to be a quiet strength based on the integrity of our people, the vision of the Constitution, an in- innate strong will and purpose that God's given us in the greatest nation on earth - the United States.", " As we have seen tonight, foreign policy and defense policy are difficult and complex issues.", "America is strong.", "America is free.", "America is respected.", "Not a single young American today is fighting or dying on any foreign battlefield.", "America is at peace and with freedom.", "Qualifications for the office of Vice President or President are not age alone.", "You must look at accomplishments, and you must look at experience.", "I have more experience than others that have sought the office of Vice President.", "Now let's look at qualifications, and let's look at the three biggest issues that are going to be confronting America in the next presidency.", "Those three issues are national security and arms control; jobs and education; and the Federal budget deficit.", "On each one of those issues I have more experience than does the Governor of Massachusetts.", "In national security and arms control, you have to understand the difference between a ballistic missile, a warhead, what throwweight, what megatonnage is.", "You better understand about telemetry and encryption.", "And you better understand that you have to negotiate from a position of strength.", "These are important issues, because we want to have more arms control and arms reductions.", "On the area of the Federal budget deficit, I have worked eight years on the Senate Budget Committee.", "And I wish that the Congress would give us the line item veto to help deal with that.", " This debate tonight is not about the qualifications for the Vice Presidency.", "The debate is whether or not Dan Quayle and Lloyd Bentsen are qualified to be President of the United States.", "And if that tragedy should occur, we have to step in there without any margin for error, without time for preparation, to take over the responsibility for the biggest job in the world, that of running this great country of ours; to take over the awesome responsibility for commanding the nuclear weaponry that this country has.", "No, the debate tonight is a debate about the presidency itself, and a presidential decision that has to be made by you.", "The stakes could not be higher.", "We agree on the fact that we have to cut this deficit.", "Dukakis has been able to cut that deficit ten budgets in a row in the State of Massachusetts, while he lowered the tax burden on their people from one of the highest to one of the lower in the United States.", "That is a major sense of achievement.", "And I admire that.", "And I'm just delighted to be on the ticket with him.", "Dukakis and I agreed that we ought to have a trade policy for this country; that we've seen this Administration more than double the national debt, that; they've moved this country from the number one lender nation in the world to the number one debtor nation in the world under their Administration; that they have not had a trade policy; that they have let trade be a handmaiden for their foreign policy objectives of the country; that this country has exported too many jobs and not enough products.", "And as I worked to pass a trade bill through the United States Senate, they threw roadblocks in the way every step of the way.", "But we passed a trade bill that has this premise, that any country that has full access to our markets, we're entitled to full access to their markets.", "Now, that means that we're going to stand tough for America, and we're going to protect those jobs, and we're going to push American products, and we're going to open up markets around the world.", "We'll show leadership in that respect, and turn this deficit and trade around.", "That's the sort of thing that Michael Dukakis and I will do to bring about a better America for all our people.", "Dukakis, one of the most liberal governors in the United States of America The one thing he tried to point out about Gov.", "Dukakis is that he's cut taxes.", "The fact of the matter is, Senator Bentsen, he's raised taxes five times.", "He just raised taxes this past year.", "And that's why a lot of people refer to him as Tax-hike Mike.", "That's why they refer to the State of Massachusetts as Taxachusetts.", "Because every time there's a problem, the liberal governor from Massachusetts raises taxes.", "I don't blame Senator Bentsen for not talking about Gov.", "He's talking more about his record.", "If I had to defend the liberal policies of Gov.", "Michael Dukakis, I wouldn't talk about it either.", " Well, I must say I hate to disappoint my good friend Bob Strauss, but we have a contract with the American people on Social Security.", "And Social Security is an issue where Senator Quayle voted eight times to cut the benefits on Social Security, where this administration came in and tried to cut the benefits, the minimum benefits, $122 a month for widows, for retirees, tried to cut the benefits for 62-year-old retirees by 40 percent, tried to do an end run on Social Security when they first came in after promising not to cut it - to cut it by some 20 billion, and while we were working together to reform the Social Security system and to be certain that that money was going to be there for people when they retired.", "At that point they tried a $40-billion end run to cut Social Security.", "Now, the record is clear.", "And we saw Vice President Bush fly back from the west coast to break a tie in the United States Senate.", "He doesn't get to vote very often in the Senate, but he made a special trip to come back and vote against a cost-of-living increase.", "And I think it's very important that we not see these kinds of end runs by this administration.", "And we should be concerned with that kind of an effort once again after the election is over.", " Senator Bentsen, you know that I did not vote to cut Social Security benefits eight times.", "What I have voted for and what Senator Bentsen has voted for is to delay the cost-of-living adjustments.", "Senator Bentsen two times in the United States Senate voted to delay the cost-of-living adjustments.", "The governor of Massachusetts at a governors' conference supported a resolution to delay the cost-of-living adjustment.", "And, John, you are right: they use this for political advantage.", "What they try to do time and time again is to scare the old people of this country.", "That's the politics of the past.", "Republicans and Democrats banded together because we know that this program is not a Republican program, it's not a Democrat program - it's a program for older Americans.", "And that program is actuarially sound to the turn of this century.", " I have a very strong record on the environment in the United States Senate.", "(Laughter) I have a record where I voted for the superfund legislation.", "I have a record where I voted against my president on the override of the Clean Water Act.", "I have voted for the major pieces of environmental legislation that have come down and been voted on in the United States Senate.", "This administration - and I support this administration and its environmental efforts - has moved in the area for the first time to deal with the ozone problem.", "For the first time we are talking about the impact of CO2 to the ozone layer.", "That's progress with the environment.", "We are committed to the environment.", "Believe me, we have a commit to preserving the environment.", "You bring up the environment, you can't help but think about the environmental policy of the governor of Massachusetts.", "He talks about being an environmentalist.", "The Boston Harbor - the Boston Harbor, which is the dirtiest waterway in America, tons of raw sewage go in there each and every day.", "What has the governor of Massachusetts done about that?", "Virtually nothing.", "And then he has the audacity to go down to New Jersey and tell the people of New Jersey that he's against ocean dumping.", "This is the same governor that applied for a license to dump Massachusetts sewage waste off the coast of New Jersey.", "Who has the environmental record?", "Who has the environmental interest?", "George Bush and I do.", "(Laughter and applause) I must say, when they talk about Boston Harbor and he says he hasn't done anything, the facts are he has a $6-billion program under way on waste treatment.", "And it was this administration, their administration, that cut out the money early on to be able to clean up water, and made it impossible to move ahead at that time on Boston Harbor.", "We are the authors, the Democratic Party, of Clean Air, of Clean Water, of the superfund.", "I am one who played a very major role in passing the superfund legislation.", "And every environmental organization that I know, every major one, has now endorsed the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket.", "And I am one who has just received the environmental award in Texas for the work I've done to clean up the bays, to clean up the water, off the coast of Texas.", "No, I think we know well who's going to help clean up this environment.", "The record is there, the history is there.", "And Dukakis and Bentsen will be committed to that.", "And I have a very good record and a commitment to the poor, to those that don't have a family, that want to have a family.", "This administration, and a George Bush administration, will be committed to eradicating poverty.", "Poverty hasn't gone up in this administration; it hasn't gone down much either, and that means we have a challenge ahead of us.", "But let me tell you something, what we have done for the poor.", "What we have done for the poor is that we in fact - the homeless bill, the McKinney Act, which is the major piece of legislation that deals with homeless - the Congress has cut the funding that the administration has recommended.", "The poor and the poverty - the biggest thing that we have done for poverty in America is the Tax Simplification Act of 1986: six million working poor families got off the payroll; six million people are off the taxpaying payrolls because of that tax reform, and they are keeping the tax money there.", "To help the poor, we'll have a commitment to the programs and those programs will go on.", "And we are spending more in poverty programs today than we were in 1981 - that is a fact.", "The poverty program we are going to concentrate on is creating jobs and opportunities, so that everyone will have the opportunities that they want.]", "That's a positive thing that's done.", "What also frustrates me with the kind of report that I have just heard here is the kind of votes that he has cast against child nutrition programs, the fact that he has voted against money that we needed for further immunization, the denial of polio shots to kids where the parents couldn't afford to get that kind of a shot.", "Now, I don't really believe that that is identifying with the concerns of people in poverty.", "Dukakis and I have disagreed on the contra program; no question about that.", "But my big difference with this Administration is, they look at the contra aid program as the only way to resolve that problem.", "They concentrate on that.", "And I really think we have to give peace a chance.", "And that's why I have been a strong supporter of the Arias plan, a plan that won the Nobel Prize for President Arias, the President of Costa Rica.", "I believe you have to work with the leaders of those other Central American countries to try to bring about the democratization of Nicaragua - by negotiation, by pressure, by counseling, by diplomatic pressure, that we ought to be trying that first.", "The concern I have is that we have a country with 85 million people sharing a 2,000mile border with us, with half of those people under the age of 15, a country that's had its standard of living cut 50 percent in the last six years.", "Now we ought to be concerned about that, and we ought to be involved.", "I was born and reared on that Mexican border.", "I speak their language.", "I've spent a good part of my life down there.", "Dukakis speaks Spanish, too.", "He's spent a good deal of time in Central and South America.", "And we believe that we ought to be working with a new Alliance for Progress, bringing in other countries to help; bring in Europeans, the Spanish, who have a real affinity for that area; bringing in the Japanese who have a great surplus now and looking for places to invest it.", "Those are the positive things I think we could do to bring about peace in that area, to help raise that standard of living and give them the kind of stability where democracy can proceed and can prosper and bloom.", "Those are the kinds of things that we'd be committed to in a Dukakis-Bentsen Administration to try to make this world a better place in which to live.", " There's no doubt in a Dukakis Administration that the aid would be cut off to the democratic resistance in Nicaragua, and that is unfortunate.", "There's a thing called the Monroe Doctrine, something that the Governor of Massachusetts has said has been superseded.", "I doubt if many Americans agree with that.", "I think they believe in the Monroe Doctrine.", "Senator Bentsen talked about the entire Central America.", "There's another issue that Michael Dukakis is wrong on in Central America, and that's Grenada.", "The Governor of Massachusetts is simply out of step with mainstream America.", " No, I don't find it embarrassing at all.", "Because you have to remember that PAC money is the result of the last campaign reform bill, one that talks about employees have greater participation.", "And what I've done in PAC money is just what my opponent in my campaign has done in his campaign.", "He has been raising PAC money, too.", "So what you have to do is comply with the laws as they are, whether you're paying taxes or you're playing a football game.", "Whether you like those laws or not, you comply with them.", "Now, I have been for campaign reform, and have pushed it very hard.", "I believe that we have to do some things in that regard.", "But I've noticed that the Senator from Indiana has opposed that campaign reform and voted repeatedly against it.", "But I think it's a loophole, frankly.", "But campaign reform, changing the rules of the game, is something we tried repeatedly in this session of the Congress, but only to have the Republicans lead the charge against us and defeat us.", "And I wish that Senator Quayle would change his mind on that particular piece of legislation and give us the kind of a campaign reform law that I think is needed in America.", " Senator Bentsen is the number one PAC raiser.", "As a matter of fact, he used to have a $10,000 breakfast club.", "It only costs high paid lobbyists, special interests in Washington, to come down and have breakfast with the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the one that oversees all the tax loopholes in the tax code, $10,000.", "I'm sure they weren't paying to have cornflakes.", "Well, I'll tell you the kind of campaign reform I'm supporting, Senator Bentsen.", "I think it's time we get rid of PAC money.", "Support our legislation where we totally eliminate contributions by special interests and political action committees, and let's have the individual contribute and the political parties contribute.", "That's the kind of campaign reform that Republicans are for.", "They want to get rid of this special interest and rely on the individuals, and also, the political parties.", "And I think this question keeps going back to the qualifications and what kind of Vice President in this hypothetical situation, if I had to assume the responsibilities of President, what I would be.", "You've got to look at experience, and you've got to look at accomplishments, and can you make a difference.", "Have I made a difference in the United States Senate where I've served for eight years?", "Yes, I have.", "Have I made a difference in the Congress that I've served for 12 years?", "I have been in the Congress and I've worked on these issues.", "And believe me, when you look at arms control and trying to deal with the Soviet Union, you cannot come at it from a naive position.", "You have to understand the Soviet Union.", "You have to understand how they will respond.", "Sitting on that Senate Armed Services Committee for eight years has given me the experience to deal with the Soviet Union and how we can move forward.", "That is just one of the troubling issues that's going to be facing this nation, and I'm prepared.", " Well, I can't leave something on the table that he's charged me with, and so let's get to that one.", "When you talk about the breakfast club, as you know, that was perfectly legal.", "And I formed it, and I closed it down almost immediately because I thought the perception was bad.", "But it's the same law - it's the same law - that lets you invite high priced lobbyists down to Williamsburg.", "And there's no control over what you do with that money.", "You can spend it on anything you want to.", "You can spent it on golf club dues, if you want to do that.", " Now, that's what I've seen you do in this Administration.", "And that's why we need campaign reform laws, and why I support them.", "And you in turn have voted against them time and time again.", " The premise of your question, John, is that somehow this administration has been lax in enforcement of the OSHA regulations.", "And I disagree with that.", "If you want to ask some business people that I talk to periodically, they complain about the tough enforcement of this administration and, furthermore, let me tell you this for the record, when we have found violations in this administration, there has not only been tough enforcement, but there have been the most severe penalties - the largest penalties in the history of the Department of Labor - have been levied when these violations have been found.", "There is a commitment and there will always be a commitment to the safety of our working men and women.", "They deserve it and we're committed to them.", "Now, the broader question goes to the whole issue of deregulation and has deregulation worked or has deregulation not worked.", "In my judgment deregulation has worked.", "We have a deregulated economy and we have produced through low taxes, not high taxes, through deregulation - the spirit of entrepreneurship, the individual going out and starting a business, the businessman or women willing to go out and risk their investments to start up a business and hire people.", "We have produced 17 million jobs in this country since 1982.", "Deregulation as a form of political philosophy is a good philosophy.", "But we believe in the market, we believe in the people and yes, there's a role of government and the role of government is to make sure that those safety - and health and the welfare of the people is taken care of.", "And we'll continue to do that.", " Well, I think you see once again a piece of Democratic legislation that's been passed to try protect the working men and women of America.", "And then you've seen an administration that came in and really didn't have it's heart in that kind of an enforcement.", "A good example of that is the environmental protection laws that we were talking about a moment ago.", "This administration came in and put in a James Watt, an Ann Gorsuch, now that's the Bonnie and Clyde, really, of environmental protection.", "And that's why it's important that you have people that truly believe and trying to represent the working men and women of America.", "I voted for the 50,000 limitation to get away from the million dollar contributions to farmer.", "Now, I feel very strongly that we ought to be doing more for the American farmer and what we've seen under this administration is neglect of that farmer.", "We've seen them drive 220,000 farmers off the farm.", "We're seeing rural hospitals close all over the country because of this kind of an administration.", "We saw our market loss by some 40 percent.", "And that's one of the reasons that we've seen the cost of the farm program, which was only about two and a half billion dollars when they took office, now go to about $25 billion.", "Now, we can bring that kind of a cost down and get more to market prices if we'll have a good trade policy.", "We would be pushing very hard to open up those markets and stand up for the American farmer and see that we recapture those foreign markets and I think we can do it with the Dukakis-Bentsen administration.", "Well, I'll tell you one way that we're not going to recapture the foreign markets and that is if, in fact, we have another Jimmy Carter grain embargo.", "You know what the farmer's interested in?", "Net farm income.", "Every one percent in increase in interest rates, a billion dollars out of the farmer's pocket.", "Net farm income, increased inflation, another billion dollars.", "Another thing that a farmer is not interested in and that's supply management that the Democratic platform talks about.", "But the Governor of Massachusetts, he has a farm program.", "He went to the farmers in the Midwest and told them not to grow corn, not to grow soybeans, but to grow Belgium [sic] endive.", "That's what his - that's what he and his Harvard buddies think of the American farmer, grow Belgium endive.", "To come in and to tell our farmers not to grow corn, not to grow soybeans, that's the kind of farm policy you'll get under a Dukakis administration and one I think the American farmer rightfully will reject.", " You know, if you let me write $200 billion worth of hot checks every year, I could give you an illusion of prosperity, too.", "(Laughter and applause) This is an administration that has more than doubled the national debt, and they've done that in less than eight years.", "They have taken this country from the No.", "1 lender nation in the world to the No.", "1 debtor nation in the world.", "And the interest on that debt next year, on this Reagan-Bush debt of our nation, is going to be $640 for every man, woman, and child in America because of this kind of a credit-card mentality.", "So we go out and we try to sell our securities every week, and hope that the foreigners will buy them.", "And they do buy them.", "But every time they do, we lose some of our economic independence for the future.", "So what we need in this country is someone like Mike Dukakis, who gave ten balanced budgets in a row there, and was able to do that, meet that kind of a commitment, set those tough priorities.", "We need an administration that will turn this trade policy around and open up those markets, stand tough with our trading partners to help keep the jobs at home and send the products abroad.", "Well, the governor of Massachusetts has run up more debt than all the governors in the history of Massachusetts combined, going back to the days of the Pilgrims.", "I don't believe that that's the kind of policy that we want.", "Well, we have changed since 1980.", "We've got interest rates down, we've got inflation down, people are working again, America is held in respect once again around the world.", "But we are going to build on that change.", "And as we made those positive changes of lower interest rates, lower rate of inflation, the governor of Massachusetts fought us every step of the way.", "We are proud of the record of accomplishment and the opportunities and the hope for millions of Americans.", "Hope and opportunity of these Americans is because of the policies that we have had for the last eight years, and we want to build on that and change it for even the better.", " I will address the military aspect, if I may respond.", "The military aspect of the drug problem is being addressed.", "As a matter of fact, we are using the Department of Defense in a coordinated effort, in reconnaissance.", "But I don't believe that we are going to turn the Department of Defense into a police organization.", "We are using our military assets in a prudent way to deal with interdiction, and we've made some success in this area.", "Seventy tons of cocaine have been stopped.", "But, you know, when you look at the drug problem - and it is a tremendous problem, and there are no easy solutions to it - it's a complicated problem, and it's heading up the effort to try to create a drug-free America, which is a challenge and a goal of all of us.", "Not only will we utilize national defense and the Department of Defense, but we've got to get on the demand side of the ledger; we've got to get to education.", "And education ought to begin at home, and it ought to be reinforced in our schools.", "And there's another thing that will be more important than the premise of this question on a hypothetical of using troops.", "We will use the military assets, we will use military assets - but we need to focus on another part of this problem, and that problem is law enforcement.", "And here is where we have a major disagreement with the governor of Massachusetts.", "He is opposed to the death penalty for drug kingpins.", "We believe people convicted of that crime deserve the death penalty, as does the legislation that's in the Congress that is supported by a bipartisan, including many Democrats of his party.", "You cannot have a war on drugs, you cannot be tough on drugs and weak on crime.", " It's interesting to see that the Senator from Indiana, when we had a resolution on the floor of the United States Senate sponsored by Senator Dole, that this government would make no deal with Noriega - that the Senator from Indiana was one of the dozen senators that voted against it.", "It's also interesting to see that one of his campaign managers that's trying to help him with his image was also hired by Noriega to help him with his image in Panama.", "(Shouts and applause) What we have seen under this administration - we have seen them using eight cabinet officers, twenty-eight different agencies, all fighting over turf - and that is one thing we would correct under a Dukakis-Bentsen administration.", "We would put one person in charge in the war against drugs, and we would commit the resources to get that job done.", "Now, Mike Dukakis has been able to do that type of thing in the state of Massachusetts by cutting the drug use in the high schools while it's going up around the rest of the country, by putting in a drug educational program that the Drug Enforcement Agency said was a model to the country.", "We would be doing that around the rest of the country.", "That's a positive attack against drugs.", " I don't believe that it's proper for me to get into the specifics of a hypothetical situation like that.", "And I've tried to list the qualifications of twelve years in the United States Congress.", "I have served in the Congress for twelve years; I have served in the Congress and served eight years on the Senate Armed Services Committee.", "I know what it takes to lead this country forward.", "And if that situation arises, yes, I will be prepared, and I will be prepared to lead this country, if that happens.", " Once again I think what we are looking at here is someone that can step in at the presidency level at the moment, if that tragedy would occur.", "And if that's the case, again you have to look at maturity of judgment, and you have to look at breadth of experience.", "You have to see what kind of leadership roles that person has played in his life before that crisis struck him.", "And if you do that type of thing, then you arrive at a judgment that I think would be a wise one.", "And I hope that would mean that you would say we are going to vote for Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen.", " I really must say, Brit, I don't make many mistakes, but that one was a real doozy.", "And I agree with that.", "It was perfectly legal.", "But I still believe that the better way to go is to have a campaign reform law that takes care of that kind of a situation.", "Even though it's legal, the perception is bad.", "So I would push very strong to see that we reform the entire situation.", "I'd work for that end, and that's what my friend from Indiana has opposed repeatedly, vote after vote.", "Let's eliminate political action committees, the special interest money.", "There's legislation before the Congress to do that.", "That way, we won't have to worry about breakfast clubs, or who's the number one PAC raiser.", "We can go back and get the contributions from the working men and women and the individuals of America.", "We can also strengthen our two party system - and it needs strengthening - and rely more on the political parties than we have in the past.", "That's the kind of campaign reform that I'm for, and I hope the Senator will join me.", " Well, I think what you can do in that one, and which would be very helpful, is to use a lot more natural gas, which burns a lot cleaner.", "And it's interesting to me to see in the resume of Senator Quayle that he brags on the fact that he's been able to fight the acid rain legislation.", "I don't think that that's a proper objective in trying to clean up this environment.", "But the greenhouse effect is one that has to be a threat to all of us, and we have to look for alternative sources of fuel.", "And I've supported that very strongly.", "The Department of Energy is one that has cut back substantially on the study of those alternative sources of fuels.", "We can use other things that'll help the farmer.", "We can convert corn to ethanol, and I would push for that very strong.", "I'll do those things that are necessary to put the environment of our country number one.", "Because if we don't protect that, we'll destroy the future of our children.", "And we must be committed to trying - to clean up the water, clean up the air, and do everything we can, not only from a research standpoint, but also in the applied legislation to see that that's carried out.", "He has said further that he will deal with the acid rain legislation and reduce millions of tons of the S02 content.", "That legislation won't get through the Congress this year.", "But it will get through in a George Bush Administration, a George Bush Administration that is committed to the environment.", "Now the greenhouse effect is an important environmental issue.", "It is important for us to get the data in, to see what alternatives we might have to the fossil fuels, and make sure we know what we're doing.", "And there are some explorations and things that we can consider in this area.", " When you look at dealing with this total problem - i t's not just with the Japanese, but the underlying question on this total world debt problem - you have got to see, why are we a debtor, and what is attracting the foreign investment into our country today, whether it's Japanese or others.", "I would rather have people come over here and to make investments in this country, rather than going elsewhere.", "Because by coming over here, and making investments in this country, we are seeing jobs.", "Do you realize that today we are producing Hondas and exporting Hondas to Japan?", "We are the envy of the world.", " Some of Senator Bentsen's supporters laugh at that.", "Well, I can tell you, the American people think the United States of America is the envy of the world.", " We are the greatest nation in this world, and the greatest economic power.", "Forgiveness of debt is wrong.", "Forgiveness of international debt would be counterproductive.", "That's not the kind of policy George Bush will have.", "But what we also should do is get them to give us more burden sharing when it comes to national defense.", "We have a situation today where, on a per capita basis, people in Western Europe are spending about one-third as much as we are in our country.", "And then when you go to Japan, where we're spending 6-1/2 percent on defense of the democracies, they're spending one percent.", "Now, the Senator from Indiana, when we passed a resolution in the United States Senate to ask for burden sharing on that cost to keep those sea lanes open from the Japanese, he votes against that.", "I don't understand that.", "And I will know them on a firsthand basis, because as vice president I will sit on the National Security Council.", "And I will know them on a firsthand basis, because I'm going to be coordinating the drug effort.", "I will have day-to-day activities with all the people in government.", "And I will be prepared to do that.", "I will be prepared not only because of my service in the Congress, but because of my ability to communicate and to lead.", " it's accomplishments, it's experience.", "I have far more experience than many others that sought the office of vice president of this country.", "I have as much experience in the Congress as Jack Kennedy did when he sought the presidency.", "I will be prepared to deal with the people in the Bush administration, if that unfortunate event would ever occur.", "Senator, you are no Jack Kennedy.", " You are the one that was making the comparison, Senator - and I'm one who knew him well.", "And frankly I think you are so far apart in the objectives you choose for your country that I did not think the comparison was well-taken.", "But the one thing we ought to know by now is that you can't go out and make secret deals with the Ayatollah, you can't trade arms for hostages.", "When you try to do that there is no question but what you just encourage more taking of hostages.", "And that's been the result by this dumb idea that was cooked up in the White House basement.", "And I want to tell you that George Bush, attending seventeen of those meetings, and having no record of what he said - if Lloyd Bentsen was in those meetings, you would certainly hear from him and no one would be asking: Where is Lloyd?", "And I would speak up on that type of thing.", "And that's what you would strive to do to have a successful release finally of those hostages.", "But not to encourage more taking of hostages.", "But there have been a number of successes in foreign policy in this administration.", "But we will keep trying, we'll keep the doors open, and hopefully some day Iran and others who control those hostages will want to return to civilized international community.", "And they can do that, starting now, by releasing those hostages that are held illegally.", " Well, I think what you have to look at is the record of a man who has served his country - (Shouts, laughter) - served his country in war, headed up a squadron in combat, a man who built a business, knew what it was to meet a payroll and create jobs, and then serve in the United States Senate; and one who has been able to bring about some of the kinds of legislation that I've been able to bring about in my service there.", "I must say I didn't do a very good job of running for the presidency, and I'm well aware of that.", "But what we are looking at today is trying to judge once again the breadth of experience and the maturity of someone taking on this kind of a task.", "That is the judgment that has to be exercised by the people of America.", "And you can't have a more important responsibility than that one.", " When you look at qualifications, you look at accomplishments as well as experience.", "And one of the accomplishments I'm proudest of is the authorship of the Job Training Partnership Act that has trained and educated and employed over three million young people and adults that are economically disadvantaged.", "And we did it in a way that we got the private sector to involve itself with the public sector on private industry councils throughout America that serve over the service delivery areas.", "We have 51 percent of that private industry council that are businessmen and women; we have members of unions; we have community-based organizations; we have education leaders.", "And what we have been able to do is establish a program that is working, that is putting people back to work.", "That is an accomplishment, and that is an accomplishment that I will take with me into the White House.", "The three books are, one, Richard Nixon's Victory in 1999, Richard Lugar's - Senator Richard Lugar's - Letters to the Next President, Bob Massey's Nicholas and Alexandra, which deals with the fall of the Russian empire and the coming of Leninism in 1917.", "And the historical book of the downfall of the czar and the coming of Leninism, combining those three books together, gave me a better appreciation of the challenges that we have ahead of us.", "In Senator Lugar's book, he talks about the advancement of human rights around the world; he talked about his leadership effort in the Philippines and South Africa, where we now see human rights advancement on the Reagan agenda.", "And the governor of Massachusetts doesn't understand that.", "I understand it.", "And a George Bush administration will pursue that policy.", " Well, I think reading \"Winds of War\" and \"Guns of August\" back to back - I think that really shows you how we make the same mistakes too often, over and over again.", "And it seems to me that the Senator from Indiana is beginning to do that one.", "I think that's a mistake.", "I think that you have to deal with the Russians from strength and we have to understand that you have to have a strong modernized nuclear deterrent, but I think we can make substantial progress and we ought to take advantage.", "I think he's arrived at a very dangerous judgment in the question of war and peace and it concerns me very much.", "Because I saw him also try to sabotage the INF treaty when it was on the Floor of the United States Senate with what he was doing there.", "He's listening once again to the winds of the radical right.", "And I'm proud to have been the author of that.", "Because you know what we had, we had a CETA program that spent $50 billion from about 1973 through 1982 and when we concluded that program - when we concluded that program, unemployment was higher than when it began.", "It was a program that didn't work and the Job Training Partnership Act does work.", "I have never said I was anything more than that, but it's not whether you're an average study, it's what are you going to do with your life.", "And what have I - going to do with my life.", "Elected to the United States Senate when I was 33.", "I now have the opportunity at 41 to seek the office of the Vice Presidency.", " I have absolutely no quarrel with Senator Quayle's military record.", "But I do strongly disagree with him on some of the issues.", "Senator Quayle has one of the worst voting records in the United States Senate on veterans issues.", "And one of them that particularly bothers me, sponsoring legislation to put a tax on combat pay and disability pay for veterans, for fighting men and women of America.", "Tax on their disability pay when they're lying there in the hospital, people who have sacrificed for our country.", "I think you ought to explain that to the people of America and you ought to explain it tonight.", " One of them that I'd work on - and I do this as a farmer - I try to turn the situation around where we have seen the subsidy payments go from two and a half billion to ten times that under this administration.", "And the way I would accomplish that--was with a tough trade policy, opening up those markets, getting those prices back up to market prices.", "We can do that if we have an aggressive trade policy for our country, if we make trade a number one priority and not trade it off for some foreign policy objective at the moment.", "That means we have to stand up for the American farmers and that cuts back on the regulation on American farmers.", "That's a positive way to accomplish that.", "I know that I fought very hard to put in an independent inspector general for the Defense Department, that the Senator from Indiana opposed me on that.", "Those are the kids of things that I'd work on.", "One of the things I learned in business is that you can expect what you inspect.", "So, we'd be a - doing a much tougher job of auditing, to try to get rid of some of these kickbacks to consultants on military contracts, to be much more aggressive on that.", "In addition, those types of things would bring the interest rate down.", "I'd try to turn this trade deficit around and that too would help us and help us very substantially.", "And I'd get rid of some things like these planes that - are going to have - that the administration wants that'll fly from New York to Tokyo and take those investment bankers over there in four hours.", "I don't think we can afford a piece of technological elegance like that.", "I'd strike that sort of thing from the ticket.", "I don't know how many people have ridden the Concorde, not many, but I voted against it, said it would be a financial disaster and it's been just that.", " The way we're going to reduce this budget deficit, and it is a challenge to make sure that it is reduce, is first to stick to the Gramm-Rudman targets.", "The Gramm-Rudman targets have worked.", "We've reduced the Federal budget deficit $70 billion.", "Senator Bentsen voted against Gramm-Rudman, the very tool that has been used to bring the Federal budget deficit down.", "We're going to need all the tools possible to bring this Federal budget deficit down.", "We need the tools of a line item veto.", "A line item veto that 43 governors in this country have, but not the President of the United States.", "The President of the United States needs to have a line item veto.", "When Congress goes ahead and puts into appropriations bills unrequested and unnecessary spending, let the President put a line through that, send it back to the Congress and let the Congress vote on it again.", "Congress has to help out in reducing this budget deficit as much as the Executive Branch.", " Michael Dukakis wasn't looking for a clone.", "I think it's part of the strength and the character of this land that he reaches out, and that he wants someone that will speak up - and that I'll do.", "I've seen many chief executives come into my office and say they're going over and tell the president of the United States off, they're going to pound the desk, and go into that office and turn to Jello.", "Now, I've dealt with many a president, and I don't hesitate for a minute to speak up.", "In the state of Massachusetts he has the homicide rate down to the lowest of any industrial state.", "It's substantially ahead of the national average.", "He's been able to do that with an educated program for the people of that state by adding some 1,500 new police officers; he's done it in turn by the leadership that I think he will bring to the ticket when he becomes president of the United States and fighting drugs.", "But you would seem him as president of the United States being very aggressive in this fight against crime, and having that kind of a successful result.", "And that's one of the reasons I'm delighted and proud to be on the ticket with him.", "Sure, we have some differences, but overall we have so many things we agree on.", "This situation of a trade policy, of cutting back on the deficit.", "Those are positive, plus things, and major issues facing our nation.", "Michael Dukakis is the most liberal national Democrat to seek the office of presidency since George McGovern.", "He is for - he is against the MX missile, the midgetman, cutting two aircraft carriers.", "He is opposed to many defense programs that are necessary to defend this country.", "That's why former Secretary of Defense and former Energy Secretary in the Carter administration, Jim Schlesinger, in an open letter to Time magazine asked Governor Dukakis, \"are you viscerally anti-military?\"", "And the reason he did is because the governor of Massachusetts doesn't want to answer former Secretary Jim Schlesinger on that very important question.", "It's very common sense.", "And she says, \"You can do anything you want to if you just set your mind to it, and go to work.\"", "You, America can make a difference.", "You're going to have that choice come this election.", "Everyone can make a difference if they want to.", " I think being born and reared on the Rio Grande, to have spent part of my life seeing some of the struggles that have taken place in one of the lowest per capita incomes in the United States.", "And that's one of the reasons I worked so hard to try to assist on education.", "Now they have.", "And they've educated more than 20,000 of those students, loaned out over a hundred million dollars.", "And it hasn't cost the taxpayers of this country one cent.", "Now you will have a choice to make on election day.", "You will have a choice of whether America is going to choose the road of Michael Dukakis or the road of George Bush as we march toward the 21st Century.", "The road of Michael Dukakis comes down to this: Bigger government, higher taxes.", "They've always believed in higher taxes; they always have, and they always will.", "George Bush will lead us to the 21st Century, a century that will be of hope and peace.", "Ronald Reagan and George Bush saved America from decline.", "We changed America.", "Michael Dukakis fought us every step of the way.", "It's not that they're not sympathetic; it's simply that they will take America backwards.", "George Bush has the experience, and with me, the future, a future committed to our family, a future committed to the freedom.", " In just 34 days, America will elect new leadership for our country.", "As Americans, we honor our past, and we should.", "But that won't happen.", "Taking care of our economy, just putting it on automatic pilot.", "It won't happen by accident.", "It's going to take leadership, and it's going to take courage.", "And the commitment, and a contribution by all of us to do that.", "I've worked for the betterment of our country, both in war and peace, as a bomber pilot, as one who has been a businessman, and a United States senator, working to make this nation the fairest and the strongest and the most powerful in the world.", "Help us bring America to a new era of greatness.", "The debate has been ours, but the decision is yours.", "I think everybody knows now we are in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.", "And a lot of you I think are worried about your jobs, your pensions, your retirement accounts, your ability to send your child or your grandchild to college.", "And I believe this is a final verdict on the failed economic policies of the last eight years, strongly promoted by President Bush and supported by Senator McCain, that essentially said that we should strip away regulations, consumer protections, let the market run wild, and prosperity would rain down on all of us.", "It hasn't worked out that way.", "And so now we've got to take some decisive action.", " Now, step one was a rescue package that was passed last week.", "We've got to make sure that works properly.", "And that means strong oversight, making sure that investors, taxpayers are getting their money back and treated as investors.", "It means that we are cracking down on CEOs and making sure that they're not getting bonuses or golden parachutes as a consequence of this package.", "And, in fact, we just found out that AIG, a company that got a bailout, just a week after they got help went on a $400,000 junket.", "And I'll tell you what, the Treasury should demand that money back and those executives should be fired.", "The middle-class need a rescue package.", "And that means tax cuts for the middle-class.", "It means help for homeowners so that they can stay in their homes.", "It means that we are helping state and local governments set up road projects and bridge projects that keep people in their jobs.", "And then long-term we've got to fix our health care system, we've got to fix our energy system that is putting such an enormous burden on families.", "But there are other folks out there.", "The key is making sure that the next treasury secretary understands that it's not enough just to help those at the top.", "Prosperity is not just going to trickle down.", "We've got to help the middle class.", " And we've -- you know, Senator McCain and I have some fundamental disagreements on the economy, starting with Senator McCain's statement earlier that he thought the fundamentals of the economy were sound.", "Part of the problem here is that for many of you, wages and incomes have flat-lined.", "For many of you, it is getting harder and harder to save, harder and harder to retire.", "Senator McCain is right that we've got to stabilize housing prices.", "But underlying that is loss of jobs and loss of income.", "That's something that the next treasury secretary is going to have to work on.", "Right now, the credit markets are frozen up and what that means, as a practical matter, is that small businesses and some large businesses just can't get loans.", "If they can't get a loan, that means that they can't make payroll.", "If they can't make payroll, then they may end up having to shut their doors and lay people off.", "And if you imagine just one company trying to deal with that, now imagine a million companies all across the country.", "So it could end up having an adverse effect on everybody, and that's why we had to take action.", "But we shouldn't have been there in the first place.", "Let's, first of all, understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system.", "Senator McCain, as recently as March, bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator.", "On the other hand, two years ago, I said that we've got a sub-prime lending crisis that has to be dealt with.", "A year ago, I went to Wall Street and said we've got to reregulate, and nothing happened.", "Now, with respect to Fannie Mae, what Senator McCain didn't mention is the fact that this bill that he talked about wasn't his own bill.", "And I never promoted Fannie Mae.", "In fact, Senator McCain's campaign chairman's firm was a lobbyist on behalf of Fannie Mae, not me.", "What you're interested in is trying to figure out, how is this going to impact you?", "And that's why it's going to be so important for us to work with homeowners to make sure that they can stay in their homes.", "And the next president has to make sure that the next Treasury secretary is thinking about how to strengthen you as a home buyer, you as a homeowner, and not simply think about bailing out banks on Wall Street.", " No, I am confident about the American economy.", "But we are going to have to have some leadership from Washington that not only sets out much better regulations for the financial system.", "The problem is we still have a archaic, 20th-century regulatory system for 21st-century financial markets.", "We're going to have to coordinate with other countries to make sure that whatever actions we take work.", "But most importantly, we're going to have to help ordinary families be able to stay in their homes, make sure that they can pay their bills, deal with critical issues like health care and energy, and we're going to have to change the culture in Washington so that lobbyists and special interests aren't driving the process and your voices aren't being drowned out.", "If less money is coming in, you end up making cuts.", "Maybe you don't go out to dinner as much.", "Maybe you put off buying a new car.", "That's not what happens in Washington.", "And you're right.", "There is a lot of blame to go around.", "But I think it's important just to remember a little bit of history.", "When George Bush came into office, we had surpluses.", "And now we have half-a-trillion-dollar deficit annually.", "When George Bush came into office, our debt -- national debt was around $5 trillion.", "It's now over $10 trillion.", "We've almost doubled it.", "And so while it's true that nobody's completely innocent here, we have had over the last eight years the biggest increases in deficit spending and national debt in our history.", "And Senator McCain voted for four out of five of those George Bush budgets.", "So here's what I would do.", "I'm going to spend some money on the key issues that we've got to work on.", " You know, you may have seen your health care premiums go up.", "We've got to reform health care to help you and your budget.", "We are mortgaging our children's future.", "We've got to have a different energy plan.", "We've got to invest in college affordability.", "So we're going to have to make some investments, but we've also got to make spending cuts.", "We've got to put an end to that.", "Now, I've listed the things that I think have to be at the top of the list.", "So we've got to deal with that right away.", "That's why I've called for an investment of $15 billion a year over 10 years.", "Our goal should be, in 10 year's time, we are free of dependence on Middle Eastern oil.", "And we can do it.", "So that would be priority number one.", "And, number three, we've got to deal with education so that our young people are competitive in a global economy.", "Senator McCain mentioned looking at our records.", "We do need to look at our records.", "Senator McCain likes to talk about earmarks a lot.", "I want to go line by line through every item in the federal budget and eliminate programs that don't work and make sure that those that do work, work better and cheaper.", "But understand this: We also have to look at where some of our tax revenues are going.", "And so we've got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that they're working for you.", "That's what I'm going to do as president of the United States.", "And President Bush did some smart things at the outset, but one of the opportunities that was missed was, when he spoke to the American people, he said, \"Go out and shop.\"", "That wasn't the kind of call to service that I think the American people were looking for.", "And so it's important to understand that the -- I think the American people are hungry for the kind of leadership that is going to tackle these problems not just in government, but outside of government.", "There is going to be the need for each and every one of us to start thinking about how we use energy.", "I believe in the need for increased oil production.", "We're going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling.", "We're going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy.", "But each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes, in our buildings.", "And one of the things I want to do is make sure that we're providing incentives so that you can buy a fuel efficient car that's made right here in the United States of America, not in Japan or South Korea, making sure that you are able to weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient.", "And that's going to require effort from each and every one of us.", "I think the young people of America are especially interested in how they can serve, and that's one of the reasons why I'm interested in doubling the Peace Corps, making sure that we are creating a volunteer corps all across this country that can be involved in their community, involved in military service, so that military families and our troops are not the only ones bearing the burden of renewing America.", " Well, I think it starts with Washington.", "Now, when Senator McCain is proposing tax cuts that would give the average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts, that's not sharing a burden.", "And so part of the problem, I think, for a lot of people who are listening here tonight is they don't feel as if they are sharing the burden with other folks.", "I mean, you know, it's tough to ask a teacher who's making $30,000 or $35,000 a year to tighten her belt when people who are making much more than her are living pretty high on the hog.", "And that's why I think it's important for the president to set a tone that says all of us are going to contribute, all of us are going to make sacrifices, and it means that, yes, we may have to cut some spending, although I disagree with Senator McCain about an across-the- board freeze.", "That's an example of an unfair burden sharing.", " Well, Tom, we're going to have to take on entitlements and I think we've got to do it quickly.", "But I think it's important to understand, we're not going to solve Social Security and Medicare unless we understand the rest of our tax policies.", "And you know, Senator McCain, I think the \"Straight Talk Express\" lost a wheel on that one.", "So let's be clear about my tax plan and Senator McCain's, because we're not going to be able to deal with entitlements unless we understand the revenues coming in.", "I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of Americans, 95 percent.", "If you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year, you will not see a single dime of your taxes go up.", "If you make $200,000 a year or less, your taxes will go down.", "Only a few percent of small businesses make more than $250,000 a year.", "So the vast majority of small businesses would get a tax cut under my plan.", "Some small business owners, a lot of them, can't even afford health insurance for themselves.", "He wants to give average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts.", "That is not fair.", "And it doesn't work.", " This is one of the biggest challenges of our times.", "It can be an engine that drives us into the future the same way the computer was the engine for economic growth over the last couple of decades.", "And we can do it, but we're going to have to make an investment.", "Contrary to what Senator McCain keeps on saying, I favor nuclear power as one component of our overall energy mix.", "But this is another example where I think it is important to look at the record.", "He said a while back that the big problem with energy is that for 30 years, politicians in Washington haven't done anything.", "What Senator McCain doesn't mention is he's been there 26 of them.", "And during that time, he voted 23 times against alternative fuels, 23 times.", "Senator McCain talks a lot about drilling, and that's important, but we have three percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.", "So what that means is that we can't simply drill our way out of the problem.", "And we're not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global warming.", "We're going to have to come up with alternatives, and that means that the United States government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like China that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week.", "We've got to make sure that we're giving them the energy that they need or helping them to create the energy that they need.", "It is breaking family budgets.", "I can't tell you how many people I meet who don't have health insurance.", "If you've got health insurance, most of you have seen your premiums double over the last eight years.", "And your co-payments and deductibles have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alone.", "If you're a small business, it's a crushing burden.", "So one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing.", "If you've got health care already, and probably the majority of you do, then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it.", "You can keep your choice of doctor.", "We're going to work with your employer to lower the cost of your premiums by up to $2,500 a year.", "And we're going to do it by investing in prevention.", "We're going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital.", "That will reduce medical errors and reduce costs.", "If you don't have health insurance, you're going to be able to buy the same kind of insurance that Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees.", "Because there's a huge pool, we can drop the costs.", "He says that he's going to give you a $5,000 tax credit.", "What he doesn't tell you is that he is going to tax your employer-based health care benefits for the first time ever.", "So what one hand giveth, the other hand taketh away.", "He would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure you're not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered.", "And that is fundamentally the wrong way to go.", "In fact, just today business organizations like the United States Chamber of Commerce, which generally are pretty supportive of Republicans, said that this would lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system.", "That, I don't think, is the kind of change that we need.", "We've got to have somebody who is fighting for patients and making sure that you get decent, affordable health care.", "And that's something that I'm committed to doing as president.", " Well, I think it should be a right for every American.", "And, Tom, I know that we're under time constraints, but Senator McCain through a lot of stuff out there.", "Number one, let me just repeat, if you've got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it.", "All I'm going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it.", "You'll still have choice of doctor.", "There's no mandate involved.", "Small businesses are not going to have a mandate.", "What we're going to give you is a 50 percent tax credit to help provide health care for those that you need.", "Now, the final point I'll make on this whole issue of government intrusion and mandates -- it is absolutely true that I think it is important for government to crack down on insurance companies that are cheating their customers, that don't give you the fine print, so you end up thinking that you're paying for something and, when you finally get sick and you need it, you're not getting it.", "They will find a state -- maybe Arizona, maybe another state -- where there are no requirements for you to get cancer screenings, where there are no requirements for you to have to get pre-existing conditions, and they will all set up shop there.", "That's how in banking it works.", "And in that situation, what happens is, is that the protections you have, the consumer protections that you need, you're not going to have available to you.", "That is a fundamental difference that I have with Senator McCain.", "He believes in deregulation in every circumstance.", "That's what we've been going through for the last eight years.", "It hasn't worked, and we need fundamental change.", " Well, you know, Senator McCain, in the last debate and today, again, suggested that I don't understand.", "It's true.", "There are some things I don't understand.", "I don't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us.", "That was Senator McCain's judgment and it was the wrong judgment.", "When Senator McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq, he suggested it was going to be quick and easy, we'd be greeted as liberators.", "That was the wrong judgment, and it's been costly to us.", "So one of the difficulties with Iraq is that it has put an enormous strain, first of all, on our troops, obviously, and they have performed heroically and honorably and we owe them an extraordinary debt of gratitude.", "But it's also put an enormous strain on our budget.", "We're spending $10 billion a month in Iraq at a time when the Iraqis have a $79 billion surplus, $79 billion.", "And we need that $10 billion a month here in the United States to put people back to work, to do all these wonderful things that Senator McCain suggested we should be doing, but has not yet explained how he would pay for.", "We are a force of good in the world.", "But there has never been a nation in the history of the world that saw its economy decline and maintained its military superiority.", "It has not worked for America.", "If we could have intervened effectively in the Holocaust, who among us would say that we had a moral obligation not to go in?", "If we could've stopped Rwanda, surely, if we had the ability, that would be something that we would have to strongly consider and act.", "So when genocide is happening, when ethnic cleansing is happening somewhere around the world and we stand idly by, that diminishes us.", " And so I do believe that we have to consider it as part of our interests, our national interests, in intervening where possible.", "We're not going to be able to be everywhere all the time.", "That's why it's so important for us to be able to work in concert with our allies.", "Right now there's a peacekeeping force that has been set up and we have African Union troops in Darfur to stop a genocide that has killed hundreds of thousands of people.", "We could be providing logistical support, setting up a no-fly zone at relatively little cost to us, but we can only do it if we can help mobilize the international community and lead.", "And that's what I intend to do when I'm president.", "They are now raiding our troops in Afghanistan, destabilizing the situation.", "They're stronger now than at any time since 2001.", "They are plotting to kill Americans right now.", "As Secretary Gates, the defense secretary, said, the war against terrorism began in that region and that's where it will end.", "So part of the reason I think it's so important for us to end the war in Iraq is to be able to get more troops into Afghanistan, put more pressure on the Afghan government to do what it needs to do, eliminate some of the drug trafficking that's funding terrorism.", "But I do believe that we have to change our policies with Pakistan.", "We can't coddle, as we did, a dictator, give him billions of dollars and then he's making peace treaties with the Taliban and militants.", " What I've said is we're going to encourage democracy in Pakistan, expand our nonmilitary aid to Pakistan so that they have more of a stake in working with us, but insisting that they go after these militants.", "And if we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then I think that we have to act and we will take them out.", "We will kill bin Laden; we will crush Al Qaida.", "That has to be our biggest national security priority.", "Nobody called for the invasion of Pakistan.", "Senator McCain continues to repeat this.", "Now, Senator McCain suggests that somehow, you know, I'm green behind the ears and, you know, I'm just spouting off, and he's somber and responsible.", "We were not promoting democracy.", "This is the kind of policies that ultimately end up undermining our ability to fight the war on terrorism, and it will change when I'm president.", "I don't think he has to be a dictator.", "And we want a democracy in Afghanistan.", "But we have to have a government that is responsive to the Afghan people, and, frankly, it's just not responsive right now.", " Well, the resurgence of Russia is one of the central issues that we're going to have to deal with in the next presidency.", "But we can't just provide moral support.", "We've got to provide moral support to the Poles and Estonia and Latvia and all of the nations that were former Soviet satellites.", "But we've also got to provide them with financial and concrete assistance to help rebuild their economies.", "Georgia in particular is now on the brink of enormous economic challenges.", "And some say that that's what Putin intended in the first place.", "We've got to anticipate some of these problems ahead of time.", "And you knew that if the Russians themselves were trying to obtain some of these territories or push back against Georgia, that that was not a stable situation.", "So part of the job of the next commander-in-chief, in keeping all of you safe, is making sure that we can see some of the 21st Century challenges and anticipate them before they happen.", "We haven't been doing enough of that.", "We tend to be reactive.", "That's what we've been doing over the last eight years and that has actually made us more safe.", "We've got to be much more strategic if we're going to be able to deal with all of the challenges that we face out there.", "Energy is going to be key in dealing with Russia.", "If we can reduce our energy consumption, that reduces the amount of petro dollars that they have to make mischief around the world.", "That will strengthen us and weaken them when it comes to issues like Georgia.", " I think they've engaged in an evil behavior and I think that it is important that we understand they're not the old Soviet Union but they still have nationalist impulses that I think are very dangerous.", "We cannot allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon.", "It would be a game-changer in the region.", "Not only would it threaten Israel, our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world, but it would also create a possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists.", "And I will do everything that's required to prevent it.", "And we will never take military options off the table.", "And it is important that we don't provide veto power to the United Nations or anyone else in acting in our interests.", "It is important, though, for us to use all the tools at our disposal to prevent the scenario where we've got to make those kinds of choices.", "Now, it is true, though, that I believe that we should have direct talks -- not just with our friends, but also with our enemies -- to deliver a tough, direct message to Iran that, if you don't change your behavior, then there will be dire consequences.", "If you do change your behavior, then it is possible for you to re-join the community of nations.", "But one of the things we've learned is, is that when we take that approach, whether it's in North Korea or in Iran, then we have a better chance at better outcomes.", "When President Bush decided we're not going to talk to Iran, we're not going to talk to North Korea, you know what happened?", "Iran went from zero centrifuges to develop nuclear weapons to 4,000.", "North Korea quadrupled its nuclear capability.", "We've got to try to have talks, understanding that we're not taking military options off the table.", "I know that I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for the fact that this country gave me opportunity.", "I came from very modest means.", "I had a single mom and my grandparents raised me and it was because of the help of scholarships and my grandmother scrimping on things that she might have wanted to purchase and my mom, at one point, getting food stamps in order for us to put food on the table.", "Despite all that, I was able to go to the best schools on earth and I was able to succeed in a way that I could not have succeeded anywhere else in this country.", "And the question in this election is: are we going to pass on that same American dream to the next generation?", "Over the last eight years, we've seen that dream diminish.", "Wages and incomes have gone down.", "And we can't expect that if we do the same things that we've been doing over the last eight years, that somehow we are going to have a different outcome.", "We need fundamental change.", "That's the reason I decided to run for president, and I'm hopeful that all of you are prepared to continue this extraordinary journey that we call America.", "But we're going to have to have the courage and the sacrifice, the nerve to move in a new direction.", " I have, I have.", "First question is what's in the best interests of the United States?", "What's in the best interests of our people?", "When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question.", "Is it in our nation's interests?", "Peace in the Middle East is in our nation's interests.", "Having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nation's interests.", "Strong relations in Europe is in our nation's interest.", "I've thought a lot about what it means to be the president.", "I haven't started naming names except for one person, and that's Mr. Richard Cheney who I thought did a great job the other night.", "He's man of solid judgment and he's going to be a person to stand by my side.", "One of the things I've done in Texas is I've been able to put together a good team of people.", "I've been able to set clear goals.", "The goals ought to be an education system that leaves no child behind, Medicare for our seniors, a Social Security system that's safe and secure, foreign policy that's in our nation's interest, and a strong military, and then bring people together to achieve those goals.", "So I've thought long and hard about the honor of being the President of the United States.", "I've thought a lot about that particular question, and I see our greatest national strength coming from what we stand for in the world.", "I see it as a question of values.", "It is a great tribute to our founders that 224 years later this nation is now looked to by the peoples on every other continent and the peoples from every part of this earth as a kind of model for what their future could be.", "And I don't think that's just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans.", "It's really true, even the ones that sometimes shake their fists at us.", "As soon as they have a change that allows the people to speak freely, they're wanting to develop some kind of blueprint that will help them be like us more, freedom, free markets, political freedom.", "So I think first and foremost our power ought to be wielded to in ways that form a more perfect union.", "The power of example is America's greatest power in the world.", "And that means, for example, standing up for human rights.", "So we've got to enforce our civil rights laws.", "We've got to deal with things like racial profiling.", "And we have to keep our military strong.", "But our real power comes, I think, from our values.", " Well, I think they ought to look at us as a country that understands freedom where it doesn't matter who you are or how you're raised or where you're from, that you can succeed.", "I don't think they'll look at us with envy.", "It really depends upon how our nation conducts itself in foreign policy.", "And yet project strength in a way that promotes freedom.", "So I don't think they ought to look at us in any way other than what we are.", " I agree with that.", "I think that one of the problems that we have faced in the world is that we are so much more powerful than any single nation has been in relationship to the rest of the world than at any time in history, that I know about, anyway.", "That there is some resentment of U.S. power.", "So I think that the idea of humility is an important one.", "But I think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world.", "We have to protect our capacity to push forward what America's all about.", "That means not only military strength and our values, it also means keeping our economy strong.", "You know, in the last, or two decades ago, it was routine for leaders of foreign countries to come over here and say you guys have got to do something about these horrendous deficits because it's causing tremendous problems for the rest of the world, and we were lectured to all the time.", "The fact that we have the strongest economy in history today is not good enough.", "We need to do more.", "But the fact that it is so strong enables us to project the power for good that America can represent.", " Yes, it does.", "Take, for example, Third World debt.", "I think we ought to be forgiving Third World debt under certain conditions.", "We do have an obligation, but we can't be all things to all people.", "We can help build coalitions but we can't put our troops all around the world.", "We can lend money but we have to do it wisely.", "We shouldn't be lending money to corrupt officials.", "So we got to be guarded in our generosity.", " The first priority has to be on ending the violence, dampening down the tensions that have arisen there.", "We need to call upon Syria to release the three Israeli soldiers who have been captured.", "We need to insist that Arafat send out instructions to halt some of the provocative acts of violence that have been going on.", "It's a very tense situation there.", "But in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there.", "Our country has been very active with regular conversations with the leaders there.", "Our bonds with Israel are larger than agreements or disagreements on some details of diplomatic initiatives.", "They are historic, they are strong, and they are enduring.", "And our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shepherd.", "Like the vice president, I call on Chairman Arafat to have his people pull back to make the peace.", "I think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the Middle East.", "I want everybody to know should I be the president Israel's going to be our friend.", "I'm going to stand by Israel.", "Secondly, that I think it's important to reach out to moderate Arab nations, like Jordan and Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.", "It's important to be friends with people when you don't need each other so that when you do there's a strong bond of friendship.", "And that's going to be particularly important in dealing not only with situations such as now occurring in Israel, but with Saddam Hussein.", "The coalition against Saddam has fallen apart or it's unraveling, let's put it that way.", "The sanctions are being violated.", "We don't know whether he's developing weapons of mass destruction.", "But it's important to have credibility and credibility is formed by being strong with your friends and resolute in your determination.", "When it comes to timetables it can't be the United States timetable as to how discussions take place.", "It's got to be a timetable that all parties can agree to, like the Palestinians and Israelis.", "Secondly, any lasting peace is going to have to be a peace that's good for both sides.", "And therefore, the term honest broker makes sense.", "This current administration's worked hard to keep the parties at the table.", "I will try to do the same thing.", "But it won't be on my timetable, it will be on the timetable that people are comfortable with in the Middle East.", "We don't know -- there are no inspectors now in Iraq, the coalition that was in place isn't as strong as it used to be.", "He is a danger.", "We don't want him fishing in troubled waters in the Middle East.", "And it's going to be hard, it's going to be important to rebuild that coalition to keep the pressure on him.", " Well, when I got to be a part of the current administration, it was right after -- I was one of the few members of my political party to support former President Bush in the Persian Gulf War resolution, and at the end of that war, for whatever reason, it was not finished in a way that removed Saddam Hussein from power.", "But the fact is that that's the situation that was left when I got there.", "Now I want to go further.", "I know the governor's not necessarily saying that but, you know, all of these flights that have come in, all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime, I'm told, except for three where they notified, and they're trying to break out of the box, there's no question about it.", "I don't think they should be allowed to.", " No, of course not, absolutely not, I want them to be tougher.", " I think it's a triumph.", "I thought the president made the right decision in joining NATO and bombing Serbia.", "I supported them when they did so.", "I'm pleased the president made the decision he made.", " Yes, I think it is.", "Absolutely.", "I don't think he would have fallen had we not used the force.", "I thought he made the right decision to do so.", "The administration deserves credit for having made it work.", "It is important for NATO to have it work.", "It's important for NATO to be strong and confident and to help keep the peace in Europe.", "Now, there's more work to do.", "I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m on record as saying at some point in time I hope our European friends become the peacekeepers in Bosnia and in the Balkans.", " Well, I've been kind of a hard-liner on this issue for more than eight years.", "When I was in the senate before I became vice president I was pushing for stronger action against Milosevic.", "He caused the death of so many people.", "He was the last communist party boss there and then he became a dictator that by some other label he was still essentially a communist dictator.", "And unfortunately now he is trying to reassert himself in Serbian politics.", "Already just today the members of his political party said that they were going to ignore the orders of the new president of Serbia, and that they question his legitimacy, and he's still going to try to be actively involved.", "He is an indicted war criminal.", "He should be held accountable.", "In some of the discussions we've had about when it's appropriate for the U.S. to use force around the world, at times the standards that you've laid down have given me the impression that if it's something like a genocide taking place or what they called ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, that that alone would not be, that that wouldn't be the kind of situation that would cause you to think that the U.S. ought to get involved with troops.", "I think it's important for NATO to be strong and confident.", " I thought that was a mistake.", "I did support it at the time.", "It was in the previous administration, in the Bush-Quayle administration, and I think in retrospect the lessons there are ones that we should take very, very seriously.", "The mission was changed.", "And as a result, our nation paid a price.", "And so I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called nation-building.", "I think our troops ought to be used to fight and win war.", "I think our troops ought to be used to help overthrow the dictator when it's in our best interests.", "But in this case it was a nation-building exercise, and same with Haiti.", "I wouldn't have supported either.", "Some of them I've got a conflict of interest on, if you know what I mean.", " I think the administration did the right thing in that case.", "I do.", "It was a horrible situation, no one liked to see it on our TV screens, but it's a case where we need to make sure we have an early warning system in place in places where there could be ethnic cleansing and genocide the way we saw it there in Rwanda.", "And that's a case where we need to use our influence to have countries in Africa come together and help deal with the situation.", "The administration, seems like we're having a great love fest tonight, but the administration made the right decision on training Nigerian troops for situations just such as this in Rwanda, and so I thought they made the right decision not to send U.S. troops into Rwanda.", "We did, actually, send troops into Rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures.",

saved more lives if we had acted earlier.", "But I do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason, Jim.", "One of the criteria that I think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military forces.", "If we tried everything else, if we have allies.", "In the Balkans we have allies, NATO, ready, willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden.", "In Africa we did not.", "Now, we have tried -- our country has tried to create an Africa crisis response team there, and we've met some resistance.", "We have had some luck with Nigeria, but in Sierra Leon, and now that Nigeria has become a democracy, and we hope it stays that way, then maybe we can build on that.", "We have to work with Nigeria.", "It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important continent.",

of a way to handle the situation was East Timor when we provided logistical support to the Australians, support that only we can provide.", "I thought that was a good model.", "But we can't be all things to all people in the world, Jim.", "And I think that's where maybe the vice president and I begin to have some differences.", "I'm worried about overcommitting our military around the world.",

cost us billions, a couple billions of dollars, and I'm not so sure democracy is any better off in Haiti than it was before.", " I don't think we agree on that.", "I would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of American troops overseas.", "I think we have to be very reticent about that.", "Like it or not, we are now -- the United States is now the natural leader of the world.", "All these other countries are looking to us.", "Now, just because we cannot be involved everywhere, and shouldn't be, doesn't mean that we should shy away from going in anywhere.", "During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States.", "The lesson was that in the aftermath of World War I, we kind of turned our backs and left them to their own devices and they brewed up a lot of trouble that quickly became World War II.", "And acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did.", "We got intimately involved in building NATO and other structures there.", "We still have lots of troops in Europe.", "We were nation building.", "And it was economic.", "But it was also military.", "And the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there.", "We had civil administrators come in to set up their ways of building their towns back.", "I think one of the lessons in between World War I and World War II is we let our military atrophy.", "And we can't do that.", "We've got to rebuild our military.", "But one of the problems we have in the military is we're in a lot of places around the world.", "And I mentioned one, and that's the Balkans.", "I would very much like to get our troops out of there.", "That would be an abrogation of our agreement with NATO.", "But I think it ought to be one of our priorities to work with our European friends to

not.", "Our military is meant to fight and win war.", "That's what it's meant to do.", "And when it gets overextended, morale drops.", "It needs to be in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear, and the extra strategy obvious.", " I don't disagree with that.", "I certainly don't disagree that we ought to get our troops home from places like the Balkans as soon as we can, as soon as the mission is complete.", "That's what we did in Haiti.", "There are no more than a handful of American military personnel in Haiti now.", "And Haitians have their problems, but we gave them a chance to restore democracy.", "That's really about all we can do.", "I certainly agree with that.", "And that's why I've supported building up our capacity.", "I've devoted in the budget I've proposed, as I said last week, more than twice as much as the governor has proposed.", "I think that it's in better shape now than he generally does.", "But there's no doubt that we have to continue building up readiness and military strength.", "And we have to also be very cautious in the way we use our military.", " That's a place where we can use our generosity to influence in a positive way, influence nations.", "I believe we ought to have foreign aid, but I don't think we ought to just have foreign aid for the sake of foreign aid.", "I think foreign aid needs to be used to encourage markets and reform.", "One being Russia, where we had IMF loans that ended up in the pockets of a lot of powerful people and didn't help the nation.", "It needs to be available for emergency situations.", "I thought the President did the right thing with Mexico and was very strongly supportive of the administration in Mexico.", "But I don't think the IMF ought to be a stop loss for people who ought to be able to evaluate risks themselves.", "So I'll look at every place where we're investing money.", "I just want to make sure the return is good.", " No, I would make some changes.", "I think there need to be reforms in the IMF.", "I've generally supported it, but I've seen them make some calls that I thought were highly questionable.", "And I think that there's a general agreement in many parts of the world now that there ought to be changes in the IMF.", "The World Bank I think is generally doing a better job, but I think one of the big issues here that doesn't get nearly enough attention is the issue of corruption.", "The governor mentioned it earlier.", "I've worked on this issue.", "It's an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies, like militaries and police departments

going to be the leader.", "And the world benefitted tremendously from the courage that they showed in those post-war years.", "I think that in the aftermath of the Cold War, it's time for us to do something very similar, to step up to the plate, to provide the leadership on the environment, leadership to make sure the world economy keeps moving in the right direction.", "Again, that means not running big deficits here and not squandering our surplus.", "I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say this is the way it's got to be.", "We can help.", "And maybe it's just our difference in government, the way we view government.", "I want to empower the people.", "I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do.", "I just don't think it's the role of the United States to walk into a country and say, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we do it this way, so should you.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d I think we can help.", "I know we've got to encourage democracy in the marketplaces.", "But take Russia, for example.", "We went into Russia, we said here is some IMF money, and it ended up in Viktor Chemomyrdin's pocket, and others, and yet we played like there was reform.", "The only people that are going to reform Russia are Russia.", "They're going to have to make the decision themselves.", "Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and/or entities invest capital, there's a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy.", "But Russia has to make the decision.", "We know freedom is a powerful, powerful, powerful force, much bigger than the United States of America, as we saw recently in the Balkans.", "But maybe I misunderstand where you're coming from, Mr. Vice President, but I think the United States must be humble and must be proud and confident of our values, but humble in how we treat nations that are figuring out how to chart their own course.", " Yes, I would.", "I just -- I think that racial profiling is a serious problem.", "I remember when the stories first came out about the stops in New Jersey by the highway patrol there.", "And I know it's been going on a long time.", "In some ways this is just a new label for something that has been going on for years.", "But

"That's just flat wrong, and that's not what America is all about.", "And so we ought to do everything we can to end racial profiling.", "One of my concerns, though, is I don't want to federalize the local police forces.", "I want to -- obviously in the egregious cases we need to enforce civil rights law, but we need to make sure that internal affairs divisions at the local level do their job and be given a chance to do their job.", "I don't think they ought to be held guilty.", "But I do think we need to find out where racial profiling occurs and do something about it and say to the local folks, get it done.", "And I also agree that most police officers, of course, are doing a good job and hate this practice also.", "I talked to an African-American police officer in Springfield, Massachusetts not long ago who raised this question and said that in his opinion one of the biggest solutions is in the training.", "And not only the training in police procedures, but human relations.", "And I think that racial profiling is part of a larger issue of how we deal with race in America.", "And other Americans have been singled out because of their race or ethnicity.", "And

to happen to them?", "They're going to be put to death.", "A jury found them guilty.", "It's going to be hard to punish them any worse after they get put to death.", "And it's the right cause.", "It's the right decision.", "Secondly, there is other forms of racial profiling that goes on in America.", "Arab-Americans are racially profiled in what is called secret evidence.", "My friend, Senator

our reading curriculum.", "Intensive reading laboratories, teacher retraining.", "I mean, there needs to be a wholesale effort against racial profiling, which is illiterate children.", "We can do better in our public schools.", "We can close an achievement gap, and it starts with making sure we have strong accountability, Jim.", "One of the cornerstones of reform, and good reform, is to measure.", "Because when you measure you can ask the question, do they know?", "Is anybody being profiled?", "Is anybody being discriminated against?", "It becomes a tool, a corrective tool.", "And if they are, fine.", "And if they're not, there has to be a consequence.", "And so to make sure we end up getting rid of basic structural prejudice is education.", "There is nothing more prejudiced than not educating a child.", " Well, I think we need tough enforcement of the civil rights laws.", "I think we still need affirmative action.", "There may be some other statute that was already on the books, but certainly the advocates of the hate crimes law felt that a tough new law was needed.", " I would support the Orrin Hatch version of it, not the Senator Kennedy version.", "And we're going

are a problem.", "So I favor closing the gun show loophole.", "In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to close it, but then the majority in the House of Representatives went the other way.", "That's still pending.", "If we could get agreement on that, maybe they could pass that in the final days of this Congress.", "I think we ought to restore the three-day waiting period under the Brady Law.",

federal government intensifies arresting people who illegally use guns.", "And we haven't done a very good job of that at the federal level recently.", "And I'm going to make it a priority.",

background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not.", "In Texas I tried to do something innovative.", "There's a lot of talk about trigger locks being on guns sold in the future.", "I support that.", "But I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come and get one for free.", "So we're distributing in our State of Texas for free.", "I think we ought to raise the age at which a juvenile can carry a handgun from 18 to 21.", "I disagree with the vice president on this issue.", "He is for registration of guns.", "I think the only

investigation of the number in Texas who got -- who were given concealed weapons permits in spite of the fact that they had records.", "And the \"Los Angeles Times\" spent a lot of ink going into

state in the union has got them.", "You can't carry a gun into a school.", "And there ought to be a consequence when you do carry a gun into a school.", "But Columbine spoke to a larger issue.", "It's really a matter of culture.", "It's a culture that somewhere along the line we've begun to disrespect life.", "Where a child can walk in and have their heart turned dark as a result of being on the Internet and walk in and decide to take somebody else's life?", "So gun laws are important, no question about it, but so is loving children, and character education classes, and faith-based programs

very strongly about that.", "And if I'm elected president, I will do something about that.", "But I think that we -- I think we have to start with better parenting.", "But I don't think that we can ignore the role played by guns.", "I mean, the fact is that there -- even though no state wants them, there are guns in some schools.", "Some kid who feels like -- doesn't matter where the gun comes from, it could be a cheap gun, expensive gun.", "What matters is something in this person's head says there is not going to be a consequence.", "So in my state we toughen up the juvenile justice laws.", "We added beds.", "We're tough.", "We believe in tough love.", "We say, if you get caught carrying a gun, you're automatically detained.", "And that's what needs to happen.", "We've got laws.", " Well, I've got a plan to do something about that.", "It's to make health care affordable and available this way.", "First, there's some who should be buying health care who choose not to.",

in my budget to expand community health centers all around the country.", "These are places where people can get primary care.", "Secondly -- and they're good.", "They're very important parts of the safety net of health care.", "Secondly, that you get a $2,000 rebate from the government if you're a family of $30,000 or less -- it scales down as you get higher -- that you can use to purchase health care in the private markets.", "It will be a huge down payment for a pretty darn good system.", "If you allow -- also allow -- convince states to -- allow states to allow the mother to match some of the children's health insurance money with it, the pool purchasing power.", "I think that's the very best way to go.", "It empowers people, it trusts people, it makes -- and it's a practical way to encourage people to purchase health care insurance.", " It's one of my top priorities, Jim, to give every single child in the United States affordable health care within the next four years.",

government by more than 300,000 people in the last several years.", "And the budget plan that I've put out, according to the \"Los Angeles Times\" again, the way these things are typically measured as a percentage of the GDP, will bring government spending down to the lowest level in 50 years.", "So I want to proceed carefully to cover more people.", "But I think we should start by greatly expanding the so-called child health insurance or CHIP program to give health insurance to every single child in this country.", "I think it's intolerable that we have so many millions of children without any health insurance.", "So it's one of my top priorities.", "Now, I know that we have some disagreements on this.", "And Texas ranks 49th out of the 50 states in health care -- in children with health care.", "49th for women with health care, and 50th for families with health care.", "So it is a priority for me.", "I think it ought to be a top priority.", "I thought that's exactly what he and Mrs. Clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a government-run health care system.", "It was fortunately stopped in its tracks.", "Secondly, we spend $4.7 billion a year on the uninsured in the State of Texas.", "Our rate of uninsured, the percentage of uninsured in Texas has gone down, while the percentage of uninsured in America has gone up.", "But actually limited government can work in the second largest state in the union.", "And therefore Congress passes the bill after our session in 1997 ended, we passed an enabling legislation in 1999.", "We've signed up over 110,000 children to the CHIPS program.", "For comparable states our size, we're signing them up as fast as any other state.", " Well, I don't know about all these percentages that he throws out, but I do know that -- I speculate that the reason why he didn't answer your question directly as to whether my numbers were right, the facts were right about Texas ranking dead last in families with health insurance and 49th out of 50 for both children and women, is because those facts are correct.", "And as for why it happened, I'm no expert on the Texas procedures, but what my friends there tell me is that the governor opposed a measure put forward by Democrats in the legislature to expand the number of children that would be covered.", "And instead directed the money toward a tax cut, a significant part of which went to wealthy interests.", "There is now a federal judge's opinion about the current management of this program ordering the State of Texas to do -- you should read that judge's language about this.", "I believe there are 1.4 million children in Texas who do not have health insurance.", "600,000 of whom, and maybe some of those have since gotten it, but as of a year ago 600,000 of them were actually eligible for it but they couldn't sign up for it because of the barriers that they had set up.", " If he's trying to allege that I'm a hard-hearted person and I don't care about children, he's absolutely wrong.", "We've spent $4.7 billion a year in the State of Texas for uninsured people.", "And they get health care.", "Now, it's not the most efficient way to get people health care.",

don't care and we're going to give money for this interest or that interest and not for children in the State of Texas is totally absurd.", "Let me just tell you who the jury is.", "The people of Texas.", "There's only been one governor ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms, and that was me.", "I'm just telling you our state comes together to do what is right.", "We come together both Republicans and Democrats.", "But it's not a statement about his heart.", "I don't claim to know his heart.", "I think he's a good person.", "I make no allegations about that.", "I believe him when he says that he has a good heart.", "I know enough about your story to admire a lot of the things that you have done as a person.", "But I think it's about his priorities.", "And let me tell you exactly why I think that the choice he made to give a tax cut for the oil companies and others before addressing this -- I mean, if you were the governor of a state that was dead last in health care for families, and all of a sudden you found yourself with the biggest surplus your state had ever had in its history, wouldn't you want to maybe use some of it to climb from 50th to, say, 45 or 40 or something or maybe better?", "I would.", "Because by his own budget numbers, his proposals for spending on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy are more than the new spending proposals that he has made for health care and education and national defense all combined.", "According to his own numbers.", "It's a question of priorities and values.", " That we spent -- the top 1% receive 223 as opposed to 445 billion in new spending.", "The top -- let's talk about my tax plan.", "The top 1% will pay one-third of all the federal income taxes.", "And in return, get one-fifth of the benefits,

Americans out of tax relief.", "We just have a different point of view.", "It's a totally different point of view.", "He believes only the right people ought to get tax relief.", "I believe everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief.", "Let me go back to Texas, for example, for a minute.", "We pay 4.7 billion.", "I can't emphasize to you how much.", "I signed a bill that puts CHIPS in place.", "The bill finally came out at the end of the 1999 session.", "We're working hard to sign up children.", "We're doing it faster than any other state our size, comparable state.", "We're making really good progress.", "And our state cares a lot about our children.", "My priority is going to be the health of our citizens.", "These folks have had eight years to get something done in Washington, D.C. on the uninsured.", "They have not done it.", "They've had eight years to get something done on Medicare.", "And they have not got it done.", "And my case to the American people is,

lowest spending, state and local, in the country, and the 2nd lowest tax burden.", "And the difference between Arkansas and the US is that we're going in the right direction and this country's going in the wrong direction.", "And I have to defend the honor of my state.", "(Laughter)  What we need is people to stop talking and start doing.", "Now, our real problem here is they both have plans that will not work.", "The Wall Street Journal said your numbers don't add up.", " Well, I think the answer to why the drop, I think, has been the economy in the doldrums.", "Why I'll win is I think I have

Helen, I really believe where people are going to ask this question about trust, because I do think there's a pattern by Governor Clinton of saying one thing to please one group, and then trying to please another group.", "And I think that pattern is a dangerous thing to suggest would work for the Oval Office.", "It doesn't work that way when you're president.", "Truman is right.", "The buck stops there.", "And you have to make decisions even when it's against your own interest.", "And I've done that.", "It's against my political interest to say go ahead and go along with the tax increase, but I did what I thought was right at the time.", "So I think people are going to be looking for trust and experience.", "And then, I mentioned it the other night, I think if there's a crisis, people are going to say, well, George Bush has taken us through some tough crises, and we trust him to do that.", "And so I'll make the appeal on a wide array of issues.", "Also I got a philosophical difference.", "I don't think we're a declining nation.", "The whole world has had economic problems.", "We're doing better than a lot of the countries in the world.", "And we're going to

totally focussed on the fact that we still could have enterprise zones, according to both parties, but we don't.", "So I am still focussed on gridlock, I guess.", "And I am also focussed on the fact that isn't it a paradox that we have the highest productivity in our workforce in the industrialized world and at the same time have the largest trade deficit, and at the same time rank behind 9 other

program, the 209 people in Richmond.", "I don't think he'll be reelected because trickle down economics is a failure and he's offering more of it, and what he's saying about my program is just not

time I'll be on a platform with my opponents, that even though I disagree with Mr. Perot on how fast we can reduce the deficit and how much we can increase taxes on the middle class, I really respect

been tried for 12 years and it's failed.", "More people are working harder for less, 100,000 people a month losing their health insurance, unemployment going up, our economy slowing down.", "We can do better.", "And it's not tax and spend economics.", "It's invest and grow, put our people first, control health care costs and provide basic health care to all Americans, have an education system 2nd

lot.", "But we've got to do even better.", "And, lastly, the other night on character Governor Clinton said it's not the character of the president but the character of the presidency.", "I couldn't disagree more.", "Horace Greeley said the only thing that endures is character.", "And I think it was Justice Black who talked about great nations, like great men, must keep their word.", "And so the

too scarce.", "When you come out in 2014, I presume I'm going to be president.", "I'm going to make sure you get a job.", "And the fact that you're making an investment in higher education is critical.", "Now, the most important thing we can do is to make sure that we are creating jobs in this country.", "Ones that can support a family.", " And what I want to do, is build on the five

traditional source of energy.", "We've also got to look to the future.", "That's why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars.", "That means that in the middle of the next decade, any car you buy, you're going to end up going twice as far on a gallon of gas.", "That's why we doubled clean -- clean energy production like wind and solar and biofuels.", "And all these things have contributed to us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in 16 years.", "And that means, yes, we still continue to open up new areas for drilling.", "We continue to make it a priority for us to go after natural gas.", "We've got potentially 600,000 jobs and 100 years worth of energy right beneath our feet with natural gas.", "So he's got the oil and gas part, but he doesn't have the clean energy part.", "And if we are only thinking about tomorrow or the next day and not thinking about 10 years from now, we're not going to control our own economic future.", "Because China, Germany, they're making these investments.", "And I'm not going to cede those jobs of the future to those countries.", "I expect those new energy sources to be built right here in the United States.", "That's going to help Jeremy get a job.", "It's also going to make sure that you're not paying as much for gas.", "As a matter of fact, oil production is down 14 percent this year on federal land, and gas production was down 9 percent.", "Because the president cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands, and in federal waters.", "Well a lot of it came from the Bakken Range in North Dakota.", "The administration brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil, this massive new resource we have.", "Look, I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables.", "I believe very much in our renewable capabilities; ethanol, wind, solar will be an important part of our energy mix.", "But what we don't need is to have the president keeping us from taking advantage of oil, coal and gas.", "And if we do that, if we do what I'm planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, North America energy independence within eight years, you're going to see manufacturing jobs come back.", "Because our energy is low cost, that are already beginning to come back because of our abundant energy.", "I'll get America and North America energy independent.", "I'll do it by more drilling, more permits and licenses.", "We're going to bring that pipeline in from Canada.", "I will never know.", " Candy, there's no doubt that world demand's gone up, but our production is going up, and we're using oil more efficiently.", "We've opened up public lands.", "We're actually drilling more on public lands than in the previous administration and my -- the previous president was an oil man.", "And natural gas isn't just appearing magically.", "We're encouraging it and working with the industry.", "With respect to something like coal, we made the largest investment in clean coal technology, to make sure that even as we're producing more coal, we're producing it cleaner and smarter.", "Same thing with oil, same thing with natural gas.", "And the proof is our oil imports are down to the lowest levels in 20 years.", "Oil production is up, natural gas production is up, and, most importantly, we're also starting to build cars that are more efficient.", "And that's creating jobs.", " But that's not what you've done in the last four years.", "That's the problem.", "In the last four years, you cut permits and licenses on federal land and federal waters in half.", " How much did you cut them by, then?", " Governor, we have actually produced more oil --", "How much did you cut licenses and permits on federal land and federal waters?", " No, no, I had a question and the question was how much did you cut them by?", "You had a whole bunch of oil companies who had leases on public lands that they weren't using.", "So what we said was you can't just sit on this for 10, 20, 30 years, decide when you want to drill, when you want to produce, when it's most profitable for you.", "These are public lands.", "So if you want to drill on public lands, you use it or you lose it.", " And so what we did was take away those leases.", "And we are now reletting them so that we can actually make a profit.", " No, it isn't.", " Production on government land of oil is down 14 percent.", " It's just not true.", " It's absolutely true.", "Look, there's no question but the people recognize that we have not produced more (inaudible) on federal lands and in federal waters.", "And coal, coal production is not up; coal jobs are not up.", "I was just at a coal facility, where some 1,200 people lost their jobs.", "The right course for America is to have a true all-of-the-above policy.", "I don't think anyone really believes that you're a person who's going to be pushing for oil and gas and coal.", "I don't think the American people believe that.", "I will fight for oil, coal and natural gas.", "And the proof, the proof of whether a strategy is working or not is what the price is that you're paying at the pump.", "If you're paying less than you paid a year or two ago, why, then, the strategy is working.", "But you're paying more.", "When the president took office, the price of gasoline here in Nassau County was about $1.86 a gallon.", "Now, it's $4.00 a gallon.", "The price of electricity is up.", "If the president's energy policies are working, you're going to see the cost of energy come down.", "I will fight to create more energy in this country, to get America energy secure.", "And part of that is bringing in a pipeline of oil from Canada, taking advantage of the oil and coal we have here, drilling offshore in Alaska, drilling offshore in Virginia where the people want it.", "Those things will get us the energy we need.", "He said when I took office, the price of gasoline was $1.80, $1.86.", "Because the economy was on the verge of collapse, because we were about to go through the worst recession since the Great Depression, as a consequence of some of the same policies that Governor Romney's now promoting.", "What I want to do is to create an economy that is strong, and at the same time produce energy.", "So, I'm all for pipelines.", "I'm all for oil production.", "And we need to win that future.", "And I intend to win it as President of the United States.", " Candy, I don't have a policy of stopping wind jobs in Iowa and that -- they're not phantom jobs.", "They're real jobs.", "I'm going to make sure --", " -- we're taking advantage of our energy resources.", "We'll bring back manufacturing to America.", "We're going to get through a very aggressive energy policy, 31/2 million more jobs in this country.", "It's critical to our future.", "You've seen, as middle-income people in this country, incomes go down $4,300 a family, even as gasoline prices have gone up $2,000.", "Health insurance premiums, up $2,500.", "Food prices up.", "Utility prices up.", "The middle-income families in America have been crushed over the last four years.", "So I want to get some relief to middle-income families.", "The top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation collects.", "So that'll stay the same.", "Middle-income people are going to get a tax break.", "And so, in terms of bringing down deductions, one way of doing that would be say everybody gets -- I'll pick a number -- $25,000 of deductions and credits, and you can decide which ones to use.", "Your home mortgage interest deduction, charity, child tax credit, and so forth, you can use those as part of filling that bucket, if you will, of deductions.", "But your rate comes down and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is every middle-income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains.", "No tax on your savings.", "That makes life a lot easier.", "Because under the last four years, they've been buried.", "And I want to help people in the middle-class.", "And I will not -- I will not under any circumstances, reduce the share that's being paid by the highest income taxpayers.", "And I will not, under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle-class.", "A recent study has shown the people in the middle-class will see $4,000.00 per year in higher taxes as a result of the spending and borrowing of this administration.", "I will not let that happen.", "I want to get us on track to a balanced budget, and I'm going to reduce the tax burden on middle income families.", "It's going to help those families, and it's going to create incentives to start growing jobs again in this country.", "And that is, I want to give middle-class families and folks who are striving to get into the middle-class some relief.", "Because they have been hit hard over the last decade.", "Over the last 15, over the last 20 years.", "So four years ago I stood on a stage just like this one.", "And we've cut them 18 times.", "And I want to continue those tax cuts for middle-class families, and for small business.", "But what I've also said is, if we're serious about reducing the deficit, if this is genuinely a moral obligation to the next generation, then in addition to some tough spending cuts, we've also got to make sure that the wealthy do a little bit more.", "So what I've said is, your first $250,000.00 worth of income, no change.", "And that means 98 percent of American families, 97 percent of small businesses, they will not see a tax increase.", "I'm ready to sign that bill right now.", "We created 23 million new jobs.", "It will be good for our economy and it will be good for job creation.", "He was on 60 Minutes just two weeks ago and he was asked: Is it fair for somebody like you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody making $50,000 year?", "And he said, \"Yes, I think that's fair.\"", "Not only that, he said, \"I think that's what grows the economy.\"", "Well, I fundamentally disagree with that.", "I think what grows the economy is when you get that tax credit that we put in place for your kids going to college.", "I think that grows the economy.", "I think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country.", "That grows our economy.", "And when Governor Romney stands here, after a year of campaigning, when during a Republican primary he stood on stage and said \"I'm going to give tax cuts\" -- he didn't say tax rate cuts, he said \"tax cuts to everybody,\" including the top 1 percent, you should believe him because that's been his history.", "And that's exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that's striving for everybody.", "The top 5 percent will continue to pay 60 percent, as they do today.", "I'm not looking to cut taxes for wealthy people.", "I am looking to cut taxes for middle-income people.", "Because if you bring rates down, it makes it easier for small business to keep more of their capital and hire people.", "I want to get America's economy going again.", "Fifty-four percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed as individuals.", "So when you bring those rates down, those small businesses are able to keep more money and hire more people.", "For me, I look at what's happened in the last four years and say this has been a disappointment.", "We can do better than this.", "We don't have to settle for, how many months, 43 months with unemployment above 8 percent, 23 million

they cheat.", "Getting us to a balanced budget.", "Fixing our training programs for our workers.", "I want to make small businesses grow and thrive.", "I know how to make that happen.", "I spent my life in the private sector.", "I know why jobs come and why they go.", " No, it's not settled.", "Look, the cost of lowering rates for everybody across the board, 20 percent.", "Governor Romney then also wants to spend $2 trillion on additional military programs even though the military's not asking for them.", "That's $7 trillion.", "He also wants to continue the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.", "Now, what he says is he's going to make sure that this doesn't add to the deficit and he's going to cut middleclass taxes.", "But when he's asked, how are you going to do it, which deductions, which loopholes are you going to close?", "He can't tell you.", "The -- the fact that he only has to pay 14 percent on his taxes when a lot of you are paying much higher.", "We haven't heard from the governor any specifics beyond Big Bird and eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood in terms of how he pays for that.", "Or, alternatively, it's got to be paid for, not only by closing deductions for wealthy individuals, that -- that will pay for about 4 percent reduction in tax rates.", "You're going to be paying for it.", "Nobody who's looked at it that's serious, actually believes it adds up.", "I -- I was -- I was someone who ran businesses for 25 years, and balanced the budget.", "I ran the Olympics and balanced the budget.", "I ran the -- the state of Massachusetts as a governor, to the extent any governor does, and balanced the budget all four years.", "When we're talking about math that doesn't add up, how about $4 trillion of deficits over the last four years, $5 trillion?", "That's math that doesn't add up.", "We have -- we have a president talking about someone's plan in a way that's completely foreign to what my real plan is.", " And then we have his own record, which is we have four consecutive years where he said when he was running for office, he would cut the deficit in half.", "Instead he's doubled it.", "We've gone from $10 trillion of national debt, to $16 trillion of national debt.", "If the president were reelected, we'd go to almost $20 trillion of national debt.", "I know what it takes to balance budgets.", "I've done it my entire life.", "So for instance when he says, \"Yours is a $5 trillion cut.\"", "Well, no it's not.", "Because I'm offsetting some of the reductions with holding down some of the deductions.", "And, you know, I was raised by a single mom who had to put herself through school while looking after two kids.", "And she worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we got everything we needed.", "My grandmother, she started off as a secretary in a bank.", "And she worked her way up to become a vice president of a local bank, but she hit the glass ceiling.", "She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career.", "She didn't complain.", "That's not what you did in that generation.", "So we fixed that.", "It also means that we've got to make sure that young people like yourself are able to afford a college education.", "Earlier, Governor Romney talked about he wants to make Pell Grants and other education accessible for young people.", "We did it by taking $60 billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, and we said, let's just cut out the middleman.", "I'm going to continue to push on this issue for the next four years.", "But number two, because I recognized that if you're going to have women in the workforce that sometimes you need to be more flexible.", "We're going to

last women have lost 580,000 jobs.", "That's the net of what's happened in the last four years.", "We're still down 580,000 jobs.", "This is what I have done.", "It's what I look forward to doing and I know what it takes to make an economy work, and I know what a working economy looks like.", "And an economy with 7.8 percent unemployment is not a real strong economy.", "An economy that has 23 million people looking for work is not a strong economy.", "An economy with 50 percent of kids graduating from college that can't finds a job, or a college level job, that's not what we have to have.", " I'm going to help women in America get good work by getting a stronger economy and by supporting women in the workforce.", " Katherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it?", "He said, \"I'll get back to you.\"", "And that's not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy.", "Now, there are some other issues that have a bearing on how women succeed in the workplace.", "You know a major difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making.", "I think that's a mistake.", "In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured.", "This is money out of that family's pocket.", "That's not the kind of advocacy that women need.", "When Governor Romney says that we should eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, there are millions of women all across the country, who rely on Planned Parenthood for, not just contraceptive care, they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings.", "That's a pocketbook issue for women and families all across the country.", "And it makes a difference in terms of how well and effectively women are able to work.", "And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same fair deal as men are.", "That's part of what I'm fighting for as president of the United States.", " I'd just note that I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not.", "And I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care of not.", "Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives.", "And -- and the -- and the president's statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong.", "President Bush and I are -- are different people and these are different times and that's why my five point plan is so different than what he would have done.", "I mean for instance, we can now, by virtue of new technology actually get all the energy we need in North America without having to go to the -- the Arabs or the Venezuelans or anyone else.", "That wasn't true in his time, that's why my policy starts with a very robust policy to get all that energy in North America -- become energy secure.", "I'm also going to dramatically expand trade in Latin America.", "It's been growing about 12 percent per year over a long period of time.", "Number three, I'm going to get us to a balanced budget.", "President Obama was right, he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years.", "He was right, but then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four years.", "And his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large.", "I came through small business.", "I understand how hard it is to start a small business.", "That's why everything I'll do is designed to help small businesses grow and add jobs.", "I want to keep their taxes down on small business.", "And the thing I find the most troubling about Obama Care, well it's a long list, but one of the things I find most troubling is that when you go out and talk to small businesses and ask them what they think about it, they tell you it keeps them from hiring more people.", "My priority is jobs.", "I know how to make that happen.", "And President Bush has a very different path for a very different time.", "My path is designed in getting small businesses to grow and hire people.", "We were losing 800,000 jobs a month when I started.", "But we had been digging our way out of policies that were misplaced and focused on the top doing very well and middle class folks not doing well.", "Now, we've seen 30 consecutive -- 31 consecutive months of job growth; 5.2 million new jobs created.", "And the plans that I talked about will create even more.", "But when Governor Romney says that he has a very different economic plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan are tax cuts.", "That's what took us from surplus to deficit.", "When he talks about getting tough on China, keep in mind that Governor Romney invested in companies that were pioneers of outsourcing to China, and is currently investing in countries -- in companies that are building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks.", "That's -- Governor, you're the last person who's going to get tough on China.", "We've brought twice as many cases against unfair trading practices than the previous administration and we've won every single one that's been decided.", "When I said that we had to make sure that China was not flooding our domestic market with cheap tires, Governor Romney said I was being protectionist; that it wouldn't be helpful to American workers.", "You know, there are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush.", "George Bush didn't propose turning Medicare into a voucher.", "George Bush embraced comprehensive immigration reform.", "He didn't call for self-deportation.", "And I think that's a mistake.", "That's not how we're going to move our economy forward.", " Well, we've gone through a tough four years.", "There's no doubt about it.", "But four years ago, I told the American people and I told you I would cut taxes for middle class families.", "We saved an auto industry that was on the brink of collapse.", "Now, does that mean you're not struggling?", "Absolutely not.", "A lot of us are.", "And that's why the plan that I've put forward for manufacturing and education, and reducing our deficit in a sensible way, using the savings from ending wars, to rebuild America and putting people back to work.", "All of those things will make a difference, so the point is the commitments I've made, I've kept.", "And I suspect he'll keep those too.", "Make sure your kids can go to college.", "Make sure that you are getting a good paying job, making sure that Medicare and Social Security...

said that by now we'd have unemployment at 5.4 percent.", "The difference between where it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million Americans without work.", "I wasn't the one that said 5.4 percent.", "This was the president's plan.", "He would reform them.", "He hasn't even made a proposal on either one.", "He said in his first year he'd put out an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges.", "Didn't even file it.", "This is a president who has not been able to do what he said he'd do.", "He said that he'd cut in half the deficit.", "He hasn't done that either.", "He said that by now middle-income families would have a reduction in their health insurance premiums by $2,500 a year.", "It's gone up by $2,500 a year.", "And if Obamacare is passed, or implemented -- it's already been passed -- if it's implemented fully, it'll be another $2,500 on top.", " The middle class is getting crushed under the policies of a president who has not understood what it takes to get the economy working again.", "He keeps saying, \"Look, I've created 5 million jobs.\"", "That's after losing 5 million jobs.", "The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country.", "The unemployment, the number of people who are still looking for work, is still 23 million Americans.", "There are more people in poverty, one out of six people in poverty.", "When he took office, 32 million people were on food stamps.", "Today, 47 million people are on food stamps.", "How about the growth of the economy?", "It's growing more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before.", "But the policies he's put in place from Obamacare to Dodd-Frank to his tax policies to his regulatory policies, these policies combined have not let this economy take off and grow like it could have.", "And that record shows he just hasn't been able to cut the deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare and Social Security to preserve them, to get us the rising incomes we need.", "Median income is down $4,300 a family and 23 million Americans out of work.", "That's what this election is about.", "It's about who can get the middle class in this

I'll put in place an employment verification system and make sure that employers that hire people who have come here illegally are sanctioned for doing so.", "I won't put in place magnets for people coming here illegally.", "So for instance, I would not give driver's licenses to those that have come here illegally as the president would.", " Now when the president ran for office, he said that he'd put in place, in his first year, a piece of legislation -- he'd file a bill in his first year that would reform our -- our immigration system, protect legal immigration, stop illegal immigration.", "He didn't do it.", "He had a Democrat House, a Democrat Senate, super majority in both Houses.", "Why did he fail to even promote legislation that would have provided an answer for those that want to come legally and for those that are here illegally today?", "People who want to build on their dreams and make sure their kids have an even bigger dreams than they have.", "But we're also a nation of laws.", "So what I've said is we need to fix a broken immigration system and I've done everything that I can on my own and sought cooperation from Congress to make sure that we fix the system.", "They'll start new businesses.", "They'll make things happen to create jobs here in the United States.", "Number two, we do have to deal with our border so we put more border patrol on the -- any time in history and the flow of undocumented works across the border is actually lower than it's been in 40 years.", "And what I've also said is for young people who come here, brought here often times by their parents.", "Had gone to school here, pledged allegiance to the flag.", "Think of this as their country.", "Understand themselves as Americans in every way except having papers.", "And we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship.", "He called the Arizona law a model for the nation.", "If my daughter or yours looks to somebody like they're not a

try.\"", "That's not true.", "I have sat down with Democrats and Republicans at the beginning of my term.", "And I said, let's fix this system.", "Including Senators previously who had supported it on

your pension.", "You also have investments in Chinese companies.", "You also have investments outside the United States.", "You also have investments through a Cayman's trust.", " I thought we were talking about immigration.", "Governor Romney says he wasn't referring to Arizona as a model for the nation.", "His top adviser on immigration is the guy who designed the Arizona law, the entirety of it; not E-Verify, the whole thing.", "That's his policy.", "And it's a bad policy.", "And it won't help us grow.", "Look, when we think about immigration, we have to understand there are folks all around the world who still see America as the land of promise.", "And they provide us energy and they provide us innovation and they start companies like Intel and Google.", "And we want to encourage

actually whether it was a terrorist attack.", " And there was no demonstration involved.", "It was a terrorist attack and it took a long time for that to be told to the American people.", "But I find more troubling than this, that on -- on the day following the assassination of the United States ambassador, the first time that's happened since 1979, when -- when we have four Americans killed there, when apparently we didn't know what happened, that the president, the day after that happened, flies to Las Vegas for a political fund-raiser, then the next day to Colorado for another event, other political event.", "I think these -- these actions taken by a president and a leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even material significance in that you'd hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses.", "It was very clear this was not a demonstration.", "This was an attack by terrorists.", "And this calls into question the president's whole policy in the Middle East.", "Look what's happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya.", "Consider the distance between ourselves and -- and Israel, the president said that -- that he was going to put daylight between us and Israel.", "We have Iran four years closer to a nuclear bomb.", "The president's policies throughout the Middle East began with an apology tour and -- and -- and pursue a strategy of leading from behind, and this strategy is unraveling before our very eyes.", " Secretary Clinton has done an extraordinary job.", "But she works for me.", "The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people in the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened.", "That this was an act of terror and I also said that we're going to hunt down those who committed this crime.", "And then a few days later, I was there greeting the caskets coming into Andrews Air Force Base and grieving with the families.", "And the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the Secretary of State, our U.N.", "That's not what we do.", "That's not what I do as president, that's not what I do as Commander in Chief.", " This -- the administration -- the administration indicated this was a reaction to a video and was a spontaneous reaction.", " It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group.", "The ambassador of the United Nations went on the Sunday television shows and spoke about how --", "We've got a long tradition of hunting and sportsmen and people who want to make sure they can protect themselves.", "But there have been too many instances during the course of my presidency, where I've had to comfort families who have lost somebody.", "You know, just a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably about a month, I saw a mother, who I had met at the bedside of her son, who had been shot in that theater.", "But there were a lot of families who didn't have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands didn't survive.", "But I also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters don't belong on our streets.", "And so what I'm trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally.", "Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced.", "But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence.", "Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there's an awful lot of violence and they're not using AK-47s.", "They're using cheap hand guns.", "And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that our schools are working; that if there's violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control.", "Part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.", "But part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur.", " Yeah, I'm not in favor of new pieces of legislation on -- on guns and taking guns away or making certain guns illegal.", "We, of course, don't want to have automatic weapons, and that's already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons.", "What I believe is we have to do, as the president mentioned towards the end of his remarks there, which is to make enormous efforts to enforce the gun laws that we have, and to change the culture of violence that we have.", "And you ask how -- how are we going to do that?", "And there are a number of things.", "He mentioned good schools.", "I totally agree.", "And I believe if we do a better job in education, we'll -- we'll give people the -- the hope and opportunity they deserve and perhaps less violence from that.", "We need moms and dads, helping to raise kids.", "Wherever possible the -- the benefit of having two parents in the home, and that's not always possible.", "A lot of great single moms, single dads.", "Because if there's a two parent family, the prospect of living in poverty goes down dramatically.", "The opportunities that the child will -- will be able to achieve increase dramatically.", "So we can make changes in the way our culture works to help bring people away from violence and give them opportunity, and bring them in the American system.", "The -- the greatest failure we've had with regards to -- to gun violence in some respects is what -- what is known as Fast and Furious.", "Which was a program under this administration, and how it worked exactly I think we don't know precisely, where thousands of automatic, and AK-47 type weapons were -- were given to people that ultimately gave them to -- to drug lords.", "They used those weapons against -- against their own citizens and killed Americans with them.", "And this was a -- this was a program of the government.", "But it's one of the great tragedies related to violence in our society which has occurred during this administration.", "Which I think the American people would like to understand fully, it's been investigated to a degree, but -- but the administration has carried out executive privilege to prevent all of the information from coming out.", "I'd like to understand who it was that did this, what the idea was behind it, why it led to the violence, thousands of guns going to Mexican drug lords.", " Well, Candy, actually, in my state, the pro-gun folks and the anti-gun folks came together and put together a piece of legislation.", "There were hunting opportunities, for instance, that haven't previously been available and so forth, so it was a mutually agreed- upon piece of legislation.", "That's what we need more of, Candy.", "What we have right now in Washington is a place that's gridlocked.", " -- we haven't had the leadership in Washington to work on a bipartisan basis.", "I was able to do that in my state and bring these two together.", " The -- first of all, I think Governor Romney was for an assault weapons ban before he was against it.", "And he said that the reason he changed his mind was, in part, because he was seeking the endorsement of the National Rifle Association.", "But we can make a difference in terms ensuring that every young person in America, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, have a chance to succeed.", "We're starting to see gains in math and science.", "When it comes to community colleges, we are setting up programs, including with Nassau Community College, to retrain workers, including young people who may have dropped out of school but now are getting another chance, training them for the jobs that exist right now.", "And in fact, employers are looking for skilled workers.", "And so we're matching them up.", "Giving them access to higher education.", "As I said, we have made sure that millions of young people are able to get an education that they weren't able to get before.", " But this will make a difference in terms of whether or not we can move this economy forward for these young people...", "The place where we've seen manufacturing go has been China.", "China is now the largest manufacturer in the world.", "It used to be the United States of America.", "A lot of good people have lost jobs.", "One of the reasons for that is that people think it's more attractive in some cases to go offshore than to stay here.", "We have made it less attractive for enterprises to stay here than to go offshore from time to time.", "What I will do as president is make sure it's more attractive to come to America again.", "This is the way we're going to create jobs in this country.", "It's not by trickle-down government, saying we're going to take more money from people and hire more government workers, raise more taxes, put in place more regulations.", "Trickle-down government has never worked here, has never worked anywhere.", "I want to make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for small business, for big business, to invest and grow in America.", "Now, we're going to have to make sure that as we trade with other nations that they play by the rules.", "And China hasn't.", "One of the reasons -- or one of the ways they don't play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency.", "Because if they put their currency down low, that means their prices on their goods are low.", "And that makes them advantageous in the marketplace.", "And manufacturers here in the U.S. making the same products can't compete.", "China has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years.", "On day one, I will label China a currency manipulator, which will allow me as president to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers.", "So we're going to make sure that people we trade with around the world play by the rules.", "Canada's tax rate on companies is now 15 percent.", "Ours is 35 percent.", "So if you're starting a business, where would you rather start it?", "We have to be competitive if we're going to create more jobs here.", "Regulations have quadrupled.", "The rate of regulations quadrupled under this president.", "I want to make sure that regulators see their job as encouraging small business, not crushing it.", "And there's no question but that Obamacare has been an extraordinary deterrent to enterprises of all kinds hiring people.", "My priority is making sure that we get more people hired.", "If we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country, then you're going to see rising incomes again.", " OK. We need to create jobs here.", "And both Governor Romney and I agree actually that we should lower our corporate tax rate.", "It's too high.", "I want to close loopholes that allow companies to deduct expenses when they move to China; that allow them to profit offshore and not have to get taxed, so they have tax advantages offshore.", "All those changes in our tax code would make a difference.", "Now, Governor Romney actually wants to expand those tax breaks.", "One of his big ideas when it comes to corporate tax reform would be to say, if you invest overseas, you make profits overseas, you don't have to pay U.S. taxes.", "But, of course, if you're a small business or a mom-and-pop business or a big business starting up here, you've got to pay even the reduced rate that Governor Romney's talking about.", "And it's estimated that that will create 800,000 new jobs.", "The problem is they'll be in china.", "Or India.", "Or Germany.", "That's not the way we're going to create jobs here.", "The way we're going to create jobs here is not just to change our tax code, but also to double our exports.", "That's creating tens of thousands of jobs all across the country.", "In the private sector, Governor Romney's company invested in what were called pioneers of outsourcing.", "That's not my phrase.", "That's what reporters called it.", "And we've put unprecedented trade pressure on China.", "That's why exports have significantly increased under my presidency.", "That's going to help to create jobs here.", "We can compete with anyone in the world as long as the playing field is level.", "China's been cheating over the years.", "One by holding down the value of their currency.", "Number two, by stealing our intellectual property; our designs, our patents, our technology.",

one.", "Number two, we have to make America the most attractive place for entrepreneurs, for people who want to expand their business.", "That's what brings jobs in.", " Candy, there are some jobs that are not going to come back.", "Because they are low wage, low skill jobs.", "That's why we have to emphasize manufacturing.", "That's why we have to invest in advanced manufacturing.", "That's why we've got to make sure that we've got the best science and research in the world.", "And when we talk about deficits, if we're adding to our deficit for tax cuts for folks who don't need them, and we're cutting investments in research and science that will create the next Apple, create the next new innovation that will sell products around the world, we will lose that race.", "If we're not training engineers to make sure that they are equipped here in this country.", "Then companies won't come here.", " Government does not create jobs.", "In the nature of a campaign, it seems that some campaigns are focused on attacking a person rather than prescribing their own future and the things they'd like to do.", "In the course of that, I think the president's campaign has tried to

class.", "I believe Governor Romney is a good man.", "Loves his family, cares about his faith.", "But I also believe that when he said behind closed doors that 47 percent of the country considered themselves victims who refuse personal responsibility, think about who he was talking about.", "Folks on Social Security who've worked all their lives.", "Veterans who've sacrificed for this country.", "Students who are out there trying to hopefully advance their own dreams, but also this country's dreams.", "Soldiers who are overseas fighting for us right now.", "People who are working

commitment that we have to meet if we're going to protect the security of Western Europe.", "And therefore on this question I don't think that there is any doubt in the mind of any American; I hope

and independence of West Berlin.", "As a matter of fact, the statement that Senator Kennedy made was that - to the effect that there were trigger-happy Republicans, that my stand on Quemoy and Matsu

is concerned, there isn't any question about the necessity of defending Berlin; the rights of people there to be free; and there isn't any question about what the united American people - Republicans and Democrats alike - would do in the event there were an attempt by the Communists to take over Berlin.", "But to indicate in advance how we would respond, to indicate the nature of this response would be incorrect; it would certainly be inappropriate; it would not be in the best interests of the United States.", "This is the history of dealing with dictators.", "This is something that Senator Kennedy and all Americans must know.", "We tried this with Hitler.", "It didn't work.", "They don't want just Quemoy and Matsu; they don't want just Formosa; they want the world.", "And the question is if you surrender or indicate in advance that you're not going to defend any part of the free world, and you figure that's going to satisfy them, it doesn't satisfy them.", "And I say that those of us who stand against surrender of territory - this or any others - in the face of blackmail, in the s- face of force by the Communists are standing for the course that will lead to peace.", "The whole th- the United States now has a treaty - which I voted for in the United States Senate in 1955 - to defend Formosa and the Pescadores Island.", "The islands which Mr. Nixon is discussing are five or four miles, respectively, off the coast of China.", "Now when Senator Green, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to the President, he received back on the second of October,

Formosa.", "I support it and the Pescadores Island.", "That is the present American position.", "The treaty does not include these two islands.", "Mr. Nixon suggests uh - that the United States should go to war if these two islands are attacked.", "I suggest that if Formosa is attacked or the Pescadores, or if there's any military action in any area which indicates an attack on Formosa and the Pescadores, then of course the United States is at war to defend its treaty.", "Now, I must say what Mr. Nixon wants to do is commit us - as I understand him, so that we can be clear if there's a disagreement - he wants us to be committed to the defense of these islands merely as the defense of these islands as free territory, not as part of the defense of Formosa.", "Admiral Yarnell, the commander of the Asiatic fleet, has said that these islands are not worth the bones of a single American.", "The President of the United States has indicated they are not within the treaty area.",

them.", "This is a serious issue, and I think we ought to understand completely if we disagree, and if so, where.", " Well I think we should st- strengthen our conventional forces, and we should attempt in January, February, and March of next year to increase the airlift capacity of our conventional forces.", "Then I believe that we should move full time on our missile production,

the presidential office in 1964.", "This is extremely serious.", "There have been many wars in the history of mankind.", "One of my disagreements with the present Administration has been that I don't feel a real effort has been made an this very sensitive subject, not only of nuclear controls, but also of general disarmament.", "Now, we may not succeed.", "The Soviet Union may not agree to an inspection system.", "But I hope the next Administration - and if I have anything to do with it, the next Administration will - make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels.", "These must be done.", "If we cannot succeed, then we must strengthen ourselves.", "But I would make the effort because I think the fate not only of our own civilization, but I think the fate of world and the future of the human race is involved in preventing a nuclear war.", "It isn't a question of the number of people who are working in an Administration.", "It's a question of who they are.", "This has been one of the highest level operations in the whole State Department right under the President himself.", "Yes, we should make a great effort.", "But under no circumstances must the United States ever make an agreement based on trust.", "There must be an absolute guarantee.", "As I uh - related a moment ago, the President has always indicated that we must not make the mistake in dealing with the dictator of indicating that we are going to make a concession at the point of a gun.", "Whenever you do that, inevitably the dictator is encouraged to try it again.", " that once you do this - follow this course of action - of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return.", "And that means war.", "We went through this tragic experience leading to World War II.", "We learned our lesson again in Korea, We must not learn it again.", "And incidentally, Senator Johnson was among those who rejected that position - voted with the seventy against the twelve.", "The road to war is always paved with good intentions.", "And in this instance the good intentions, of course, are a desire for peace.", "But certainly we're not going to have peace by giving in and indicating in advance that we are not going to defend what has become a symbol of freedom.", " I don't think it's possible for Mr. Nixon to state the record in distortion of the facts with more precision than he just did.", "In 1955, Mr. Dulles at a press conference said: \"The treaty that we have with the Republic of China excludes Quemoy and Matsu from the treaty area.\"", "That was done with much thought and deliberation.", "Therefore that treaty does not commit the United States to defend anything except Formosa and the Pescadores, and to deal with acts against that treaty area.", "I completely sustained the treaty.", "I voted for it.", "I would take any action necessary to defend the treaty, Formosa, and the Pescadores Island.", "General Twining said they were still doing it in 1959.", "General Ridgway said - who was Chief of Staff: \"To go to war for Quemoy and Matsu to me would seem an unwarranted and tragic course to take.", "To me that concept is completely repugnant.\"", "So I stand with them.", "I stand with the Secretary of State, Mr. Herter, who said these islands were indefensible.", "I believe that we should meet our commitments, and if the Chinese Communists attack the Pescadores and Formosa, they know that it will mean a war.", "I would not ho- hand over these islands under any point of gun.", "But I merely say that the treaty is quite precise and I sustain the treaty.", "Mr. Nixon would add a guarantee to islands five miles off the coast of the re- Republic of China when he's never really protested the Communists seizing Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States.", " Well, I must say that uh - Mr. Truman has uh - his methods of expressing things; he's been in politics for fifty years; he's been president of the United States.", "They may - are not my style.", "But I really don't think there's anything that I could say to President Truman that's going to cause him, at the age of seventy-six, to change his particular speaking manner.", " Yes, I think so.", "We all have tempers; I have one; I'm sure Senator Kennedy has one.", "But when a man's president of the United States, or a former president, he has an obligation not to lose his temper in public.", "One thing I've noted as I've traveled around the country are the tremendous number of children who come out to see the presidential candidates.", "I see mothers holding their babies up, so that they can see a man who might be president of the United States.", "I know Senator Kennedy sees them, too.", "It makes you realize that whoever is president is going to be a man that all the children of America will either look up to, or will look down to.", "And I can only say that I'm very proud that President Eisenhower restored dignity and decency and, frankly, good language to the conduct of the presidency of the United States.", "Uh - I obviously don't think it's valid.", "As far as Indochina was concerned, I stated over and over again that it was essential during that period that the United States make it clear that we would not tolerate Indochina falling under Communist domination.", "Now, as a result of our taking the strong stand that we did, the civil war there was ended; and today, at least in the south of Indochina, the Communists have moved out and we do have a strong, free bastion there.", "Now, looking to the U-2 flights, I would like to point out that I have been supporting the President's position throughout.", "I think the President was correct in ordering these flights.", "I think the President was correct, certainly, in his decision to continue the flights while the conference was going on.", "Because they know as Senator Kennedy will have to know that if you do that you encourage them to more aggression.", "The reason Indochina was preserved was the result of the Geneva Conference which Indochina.", "I never criticized the U-2 flights in general, however.", "I never suggested espionage should stop.", "Number three, the Vice President - on May fifteenth after the U-2 flight - indicated that the flights were going on, even though the Administration and the President had canceled the flights on May twelfth.", "Number three, the pre - Vice President suggests that we should keep the Communists in doubt about whether we would fight on Quemoy and Matsu.", "That's not the position he's taking.", "He didn't take that position on Tibet.", "He didn't take that position on Budapest.", "He doesn't take that position that I've seen so far in Laos.", "Guinea and Ghana have both moved within the Soviet sphere of influence in foreign policy; so has Cuba.", "I merely say that the United States should meet its commitments to Que- to uh - Formosa and the Pescadores.", "But as Admiral Yarnell has said, and he's been supported by most military authority, these islands that we're now talking about are not worth the bones of a single American soldier; and I know how difficult it is to sustain troops close to the shore under artillery bombardment.", "And therefore, I think, we should make it very clear the disagreement between Mr. Nixon and myself.", " Well the que- the - Mr. Griffin, I believe, who is the head of the Klan, who lives in Tampa, Florida, indicated a - in a statement, I think, two or three weeks ago that he was not going to vote for me, and that he was going to vote for Mr. Nixon.", "I do not suggest in any way, nor have I ever, that that indicates that Mr. Nixon has the slightest sympathy, involvement, or in any way imply any inferences in regard to the Ku Klux Klan.", "That's absurd.", "I don't suggest that, I don't support it.", "I would disagree with it.", "Mr. Nixon knows very well that in this - in this whole matter that's been involved with the so-called religious discussion in this campaign, I've never suggested, even by the vaguest implication, that he did anything but disapprove it.", "I disapprove of the issue.", "I do not suggest that Mr. Nixon does in any way.", "On our last television debate, I pointed out that it was my position that Americans must choose the best man that either party could produce.", "We can't settle for anything but the best.", "And that means that we can't have any test of religion.", "We can't have any test of race.", "It must be a test of a man.", "I have seen Communism abroad.", "I see what it does.", "Communism is the enemy of all religions; and we who do believe in God must join together.", "We must not be divided on this issue.", "The worst thing that I can think can happen in this campaign would be for it to be decided on religious issues.", "We cannot have it in our hearts.", "But we certainly cannot have it in a presidential campaign.", "Uh - I will say simply, in advance of it, that I believe that in this area, the laws which should be passed uh - as far as the big national emergency strikes are concerned, are ones that will give the president more weapons with which to deal with those strikes.", "Now, I have a basic disagreement with Senator Kennedy, though, on this point.", "He has taken the position, when he first indicated in October of last year, that he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons the president might have to stop a national emergency strike.", "I understand in his last speech before the Steelworkers Union, that he changed that position and indicated that he felt that government seizure might be the best way to stop a strike which could not be settled by collective bargaining.", "I do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure.", "I do believe, however, that we can give to the president of the United States powers, in addition to what he presently has in the fact finding area, which would enable him to be more effective than we have been in handling these strikes.", "The record in handling them has been very good during this Administration.", "We have had less man-hours lost by strikes in these last seven years than we had in the previous seven years, by a great deal.", "And I only want to say that however good the record is, it's got to be better.", "Because in this critical year - period of the sixties we've got to move forward, all Americans must move forward together, and we have to get the greatest cooperation possible between labor and management.", "We cannot afford stoppages of massive effect on the economy when we're in the terrible competition we're in with the Soviets.", " Well, I always have difficulty recognizing my positions when they're stated by the Vice President.", "I never suggested that compulsory arbitration was the solution for national emergency disputes.", "I'm opposed to that, was opposed to it in October, 1958.", "I have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act.", "I don't know what other weapons the Vice President is talking about.", "I'm talking about giving him four or five tools - not only the fact-finding committee that he now has under the injunction provision, not only the injunction, but also the power of the fact-finding commission to make recommendations - recommendations which would not be binding, but nevertheless would have great force of public opinion behind them.", "One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure.", "There might be others.", "The difficulty now is the president's course is quite limited.", "He can set up a fact-finding committee.", "The fact-finding committee's powers are limited.", "This is a difficult and sensitive matter.", "But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do.", " Yes, I have stated in both uh - debates and state again that I believe in a balanced budget and have supported that concept during my fourteen years in the Congress.", "On the question of the cost of our budget, I have stated that it's my best judgment that our agricultural program will cost a billion and a half, possibly two billion dollars less than the present agricultural program.", "We've spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before that.", "Secondly, I believe that the high interest-rate policy that this Administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt - merely funding the debt - which is a burden an the taxpayers.", "I would hope, under a different monetary policy, that it would be possible to reduce that interest-rate burden, at least a billion dollars.", "Third, I think it's possible to gain a seven hundred million to a billion dollars through tax changes which I believe would close up loof- loopholes on dividend withholding, on expense accounts.", "Fourthly, I have suggested that the medical care for the aged - and the bill which the Congress now has passed and the President signed if fully implemented would cost a billion dollars on the Treasury - out of Treasury funds and a billion dollars by the states - the proposal that I have put forward and which many of the members of my party support is for medical care financed under Social Security; which would be financed under the Social Security taxes; which is less than three cents a day per person for medical care, doctors' bills, nurses, hospitals, when they retire.", "So in my judgment we would spend more money in this Administration on aid to education, we'd spend more money on housing, we'd spend more money and I hope more wisely on defense than this Administration has.", "But I believe that the next Administration should work for a balanced budget, and that would be my intention.", " Senator Kennedy has indicated on several occasions in this program tonight that I have been misstating his record and his figures.", "Uh - On the one hand, for example, he suggests that as far as his medical care program is concerned that that really isn't a problem because it's from Social Security.", "But Social Security is a tax.", "The people pay it.", "It comes right out of your paycheck.", "This doesn't mean that the people aren't going to be paying the bill.", "He also indicates as far as his agricultural program is concerned that he feels it will cost less than ours.", "Well, all that I can suggest is that all the experts who have studied the program indicate that it is the most fantastic program, the worst program, insofar as its effect on the farmers, that the - America has ever had foisted upon it in an election year or any other time.", "And I would also point out that Senator Kennedy left out a part of the cost of that program - a twenty-five percent rise in food prices that the people would have to pay.", "Now are we going to have that when it isn't going to help the farmers?", "I don't think we should have that kind of a program.", "Then he goes on to say that he's going to change the interest-rate situation and we're going to get some more money that way.", "Well, what he is saying there in effect, we're going to have inflation.", "We're going to go right back to what we had under Mr. Truman when he had political control of the Federal Reserve Board.", "I don't believe we ought to pay our bills through inflation, through a phony interest rate.", " Mr. Drummond, I am never satisfied with the economic growth of this country.", "I'm not satisfied with it even if there were no Communism in the world, but particularly when we're in the kind of a race we're in, we have got to see that America grows just as fast as we can, provided we grow soundly.", "Because America must be able to grow enough not only to take care of our needs at home for better education and housing and health - all these things we want.", "We've got to grow enough to maintain the forces that we have abroad and to wage the non-military battle for the war - uh - for the world in Asia, in Africa and Latin America.", "It's going to cost more money, and growth will help us to win that battle.", "And here I believe basically that what we have to do is to stimulate that sector of America, the private enterprise sector of the economy, in which there is the greatest possibility for expansion.", "So that is why I advocate a program of tax reform which will stimulate more investment in our economy.", "In addition to that, we have to move on other areas that are holding back growth.", "I refer, for example, to distressed areas.", "We have to move into those areas with programs so that we make adequate use of the resources of those areas.", "We also have to see that all of the people of the United States - the tremendous talents that our people have - are used adequately.", "That's why in this whole area of civil rights, the equality of opportunity for employment and education is not just for the benefit of the minority groups, it's for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need.", "And in addition to that, we need programs, particularly in higher education, which will stimulate scientific breakthroughs which will bring more growth.", "Anybody who says America's been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling around America.", "He's been traveling in some other country.", "We have been moving.", "We have been moving much faster than we did in the Truman years.", "The fa- the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twenty-five-cent loaf of bread.", "Even if you put his income up ten percent, that would be two and three-quarters percent three pers- or three cents out of that twenty-five cents.", "The t- man who grows tomatoes - it costs less for those tomatoes than it does for the label on the can.", "And I believe when the average hour for many farmers' wage is about fifty cents an hour, he should do better.", "But anybody who suggests that that program would c- come to any figure indicated by the Vice President is in error.", "The Vice President suggested a number of things.", "He suggested that we aid distressed areas.", "The Administration has vetoed that bill passed by the Congress twice.", "He suggested we pass an aid to education bill.", "But the Administration and the Republican majority in the Congress has opposed any realistic aid to education.", "And the Vice President cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers' salaries in the Senate, which prevented that being added.", "This Administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth - which means jobs - of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959.", "And when we have to find twenty-five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years, we're going to have to grow more.", "Governor Rockefeller says five per cent.", "The Democratic platform and others say five per cent.", "Many say four and a half per cent.", "The last eight years the average growth has been about two and a half per cent.", "That's why we don't have full employment today.", " Uh - Mr. McGee, there are about a hundred and four commodities that have some kind of depletion allowance - different kind of minerals, including oil.", "I believe all of those should be gone over in detail to make sure that no one is getting a tax break; to make sure that no one is getting away from paying the taxes he ought to pay.", " it includes all kinds of minerals; it includes everything within the range of taxation.", "We want to be sure it's fair and equitable.", "It includes oil abroad.", "Perhaps that oil abroad should be treated differently than the oil here at home.", "Now the oil industry recently has had hard times.", "Particularly some of the smaller producers.", "They're moving about eight or nine days in Texas.", "But I can assure you that if I'm elected president, the whole spectrum of taxes will be gone through carefully.", "And if there is any inequities in oil or any other commodity, then I would vote to close that loophole, I have voted in the past to reduce the depletion allowance for the largest producers; for those from five million dollars down, to maintain it at twenty-seven and a half per cent.", "I believe we should study this and other allowances; tax expense, dividend expenses and all the rest, and make a determination of how we can stimulate growth; how we can provide the revenues needed to move our country forward.", " Senator Kennedy's position and mine completely different on this.", "I favor the present depletion allowance.", "Because this is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to go out and explore for oil, to develop it.", "If we didn't have a depletion allowance of certainly, I believe, the present amount, we would have our oil exploration cut substantially in this country.", "And it's because of my belief that if America is going to have the growth that he talks about and that I talk about and that we want, the thing to do is not to discourage individual enterprise, not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and minerals, but to encourage them.", "And so he would be doing exactly the wrong thing.", "He suggests that there are a number of other items in this whole depletion field that could be taken into account.", "He also said a moment ago that we would get more money to finance his programs by revising the tax laws, including depletion.", "But I oppose it.", "Von Fremd, the first thing we have to do is to continue to keep confidence abroad in the American dollar.", "Secondly, we have to increase our exports, as compared with our imports.", "And here we have a very strong program going forward in the Department of Commerce.", "This one must be stepped up.", "Beyond that, as far as the gold supply is concerned, and as far as the movement of gold is concerned, uh - we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom.", "Now America has been carrying a tremendous load in this respect.", "I think we have been right in carrying it.", "I have favored our programs abroad for economic assistance and for military assistance.", "But now we find that the countries of Europe for example, that we have aided, and Japan, that we've aided in the Far East; these countries - some our former enemies, have now recovered completely.", "They have got to bear a greater share of this load of economic assistance abroad.", "That's why I am advocating, and will develop during the course of the next Administration - if, of course, I get the opportunity - a program in which we enlist more aid from these other countries on a concerted basis in the programs of economic development for Africa, Asia and Latin America.", "The United States cannot continue to carry the major share of this burden by itself.", " Just to uh - correct the record, Mr. Nixon said on depletion that his record was the opposite of mine.", "What I said was that this matter should be thoroughly gone into to make sure that there aren't loopholes.", "If his record is the opposite of that, that means that he doesn't want to go into it.", "The difficulty, of course, is that we do have heavy obligations abroad, that we therefore have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of our dollars overseas to pay our troops, maintain our bases, and sustain other economies.", "In other words, if we're going to continue to maintain our position in the sixties, we have to maintain a sound monetary and fiscal policy.", "We have to have control over inflation, and we also have to have a favorable balance of trade.", "We have to be able to compete in the world market.", "We have to be able to sell abroad more than we consume uh - from abroad if we're going to be able to meet our obligations.", "In addition, many of the countries around the world still keep restrictions against our goads, going all the way back to the days when there was a dollar shortage.", "Now there isn't a dollar shortage, and yet many of these countries continue to move against our goods.", "We have to be sure to maintain that.", "We have to persuade these other countries not to restrict our goods coming in, not to act as if there was a dollar gap; and third, we have to persuade them to assume some of the responsibilities that up till now we've maintained, to assist underdeveloped countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia make an economic breakthrough on their own.", "And the significance of prestige, really, is because we're so identified with the cause of freedom.", "There have been several indications that our prestige is not as high as it once was.", "He said that many of these countries equate space developments with scientific productivity and scientific advancement.", "And therefore, he said, many of these countries now feel that the Soviet Union, which was once so backward, is now on a par with the United States.", "Secondly, the economic growth of the Soviet Union is greater than ours.", "Mr. Dulles has suggested it's from two to three times as great as ours.", "This has a great effect on the s- underdeveloped world, which faces problems of low income and high population density and inadequate resources.", "Three, a Gallup Poll taken in February asked people in ten countries which country they thought would be first in 1970, both scientifically and militarily.", "And a majority in every country except Greece, felt that it would be the Soviet Union by l970.", "Every other ca- African country either abstained or voted against us.", "A - More countries voted against us in Asia on this issue than voted with us.", "On the neutralists' resolution, which we were so much opposed to, the same thing happened.", "The candidate who was a candidate for the president of Brazil, took a trip to Cuba to call on Mr. Castro during the election in order to get the benefit of the Castro supporters uh - within Brazil.", "Laos is moving in that direction.", "So I would say our prestige is not so high.", "No longer do we give the image of being on the rise.", "No longer do we give an image of vitality.", " Well, I would say first of all that Senator's - Kennedy's statement that he's just made is not going to help our Gallup Polls abroad and it isn't going to help our prestige either.", "Let's look at the other side of the coin.", "Let's look at the vote on the Congo, the vote was seventy to nothing against the Soviet Union.", "Let's look at the situation with regard to economic growth as it really is.", "We find that the Soviet Union is a very primitive economy.", "Its growth rate is not what counts; it's whether it is catching up with us and it is not catching up with us.", "We're well ahead and we can stay ahead, provided we have confidence in America and don't run her down in order to build her up.", "I can think of nothing that will be a greater blow to the prestige of the United States among the free nations in Asia than for us to take Senator Kennedy's advan- advice to go - go against what a majority of the members of the Senate, both Democrat and Republican, did - said in 1955, and to say in advance we will surrender an area to the Communists.", "In other words, if the United States is going to maintain its strength and its prestige, we must not only be strong militarily and economically, we must be firm diplomatically.", "Thi- Certainly we have been speaking, I know, of whether we should have retreat or defeat.", "Let's remember the way to win is not to retreat and not to surrender.", "Cheryl, the president didn't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, so he's really turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception.", "And the result is that you've been bombarded with advertisements suggesting that I've changed a position on this or that or the other.", "I support it.", "The chairman of the Republican Party thinks we ought to change a few things.", "No Child Left Behind Act, I voted for it.", "I support the goals.", "But the president has underfunded it by $28 billion.", "Right here in St. Louis, you've laid off 350 teachers.", "You're 150 -- excuse me, I think it's a little more, about $100 million shy of what you ought to be under the No Child Left Behind Act to help your education system here.", "So I complain about that.", "I've argued that we should fully funded it.", "The president says I've changed my mind.", "I haven't changed my mind: I'm going to fully fund it.", "Now, the president has presided over an economy where we've lost 1.6 million jobs.", "The first president in 72 years to lose jobs.", "I have a plan to put people back to work.", "That's not wishy- washy.", "I'm going to close the loopholes that actually encourage companies to go overseas.", "The president wants to keep them open.", "I think I'm right.", "I think he's wrong.", "I'm going to give you a tax cut.", "The president gave the top 1 percent of income-earners in America, got $89 billion last year, more than the 80 percent of people who earn $100,000 or less all put together.", "I think that's wrong.", "That's not wishy-washy, and that's what I'm fighting for, you.", "I can see why people at your workplace think he changes positions a lot, because he does.", "He said he voted for the $87 billion, and voted against it right before he voted for it.", "And that sends a confusing signal to people.", "He said he thought Saddam Hussein was a grave threat, and now he said it was a mistake to remove Saddam Hussein from power.", "No, I can see why people think that he changes position quite often, because he does.", "You know, for a while he was a strong supporter of getting rid of Saddam Hussein.", "He saw the wisdom -- until the Democrat primary came along and Howard Dean, the anti-war candidate, began to gain on him, and he changed positions.", "I don't see how you can lead this country in a time of war, in a time of uncertainty, if you change your mind because of politics.", "He just brought up the tax cut.", "You remember we increased that child credit by $1,000, reduced the marriage penalty, created a 10 percent tax bracket for the lower-income Americans.", "That's right at the middle class.", "He voted against it.", "And yet he tells you he's for a middle- class tax cut.", "It's -- you've got to be consistent when you're the president.", "There's a lot of pressures.", "And you've got to be firm and consistent.", "And obviously we hope that diplomacy works before you ever use force.", "The hardest decision a president makes is ever to use force.", "After 9/11, we had to look at the world differently.", "After 9/11, we had to recognize that when we saw a threat, we must take it seriously before it comes to hurt us.", "In the old days we'd see a threat, and we could deal with it if we felt like it or not.", "But 9/11 changed it all.", "I vowed to our countrymen that I would do everything I could to protect the American people.", "That's why we're bringing Al Qaida to justice.", "Seventy five percent of them have been brought to justice.", "That's why I said to Afghanistan: If you harbor a terrorist, you're just as guilty as the terrorist.", "And the Taliban is no longer in power, and Al Qaida no longer has a place to plan.", "And that was the serious, serious threat.", "So I tried diplomacy, went to the United Nations.", "But as we learned in the same report I quoted, Saddam Hussein was gaming the oil-for-food program to get rid of sanctions.", "He was trying to get rid of sanctions for a reason: He wanted to restart his weapons programs.", "My opponent thought there was weapons there.", "That's why he called him a grave threat.", "I wasn't happy when we found out there wasn't weapons, and we've got an intelligence group together to figure out why.", "But Saddam Hussein was a unique threat.", "And the world is better off without him in power.", "And my opponent's plans lead me to conclude that Saddam Hussein would still be in power, and the world would be more dangerous.", "The world is more dangerous today.", "Now, the president wishes that I had changed my mind.", "He wants you to believe that because he can't come here and tell you that he's created new jobs for America.", "He's lost jobs.", "He's trying to attack me.", "He wants you to believe that I can't be president.", "And he's trying to make you believe it because he wants you to think I change my mind.", "I do believe Saddam Hussein was a threat.", "I always believed he was a threat.", "Believed it in 1998 when Clinton was president.", "I wanted to give Clinton the power to use force if necessary.", "But I would have used that force wisely, I would have used that authority wisely, not rushed to war without a plan to win the peace.", "I would have brought our allies to our side.", "I would have fought to make certain our troops had everybody possible to help them win the mission.", "This president rushed to war, pushed our allies aside.", "And Iran now is more dangerous, and so is North Korea, with nuclear weapons.", "My opponent said that America must pass a global test before we used force to protect ourselves.", "That's the kind of mindset that says sanctions were working.", "That's the kind of mindset that said, \"Let's keep it at the United Nations and hope things go well.\"", "Sanctions were not working.", "The United Nations was not effective at removing Saddam Hussein.", " The goal of the sanctions was not to remove Saddam Hussein, it was to remove the weapons of mass destruction.", "And, Mr. President, just yesterday the Duelfer report told you and the whole world they worked.", "He didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Mr. President.", "That was the objective.", "And right now, Osama bin Laden might be in jail or dead.", "That's the war against terror.", "You see that every night on television.", "There's chaos in Iraq.", "King Abdullah of Jordan said just yesterday or the day before you can't hold elections in Iraq with the chaos that's going on today.", "Senator Richard Lugar, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that the handling of the reconstruction aid in Iraq by this administration has been incompetent.", "Those are the Republican chairman's words.", "Senator Hagel of Nebraska said that the handling of Iraq is beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing; it's in the zone of dangerous.", "Those are the words of two Republicans, respected, both on the Foreign Relations Committee.", "I would reach out to our allies in a way that this president hasn't.", "He pushed them away time and again, pushed them away at the U.N., pushed them away individually.", "Two weeks ago, there was a meeting of the North Atlantic Council, which is the political arm of NATO.", "They discussed the possibility of a small training unit or having a total takeover of the training in Iraq.", "Did our administration push for the total training of Iraq?", "No.", "Were they silent?", "Yes.", "Was there an effort to bring all the allies together around that?", "No, because they've always wanted this to be an American effort.", "You know, they even had the Defense Department issue a memorandum saying, \"Don't bother applying for assistance or for being part of the reconstruction if you weren't part of our original coalition.\"", "Now, that's not a good way to build support and reduce the risk for our troops and make America safer.", "I'm going to get the training done for our troops.", "I'm going to get the training of Iraqis done faster.", "And I'm going to get our allies back to the table.", " Two days ago in the Oval Office, I met with the finance minister from Iraq.", "He came to see me.", "And he talked about how optimistic he was and the country was about heading toward elections.", " They're going from tyranny to elections.", "He talked about the reconstruction efforts that are beginning to take hold.", "He talked about the fact that Iraqis love to be free.", "He said he was optimistic when he came here, then he turned on the TV and listened to the political rhetoric and all of a sudden he was pessimistic.", "Now, this is guy a who, along with others, has taken great risk for great freedom.", "And we need to stand with him.", "We're going to train troops, and we are.", "We'll have 125,000 trained by the end of December.", "We're spending about $7 billion.", "He talks about a grand idea: Let's have a summit; we're going to solve the problem in Iraq by holding a summit.", "And what is he going to say to those people that show up at the summit?", "Join me in the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place.", "Risk your troops in a war you've called a mistake.", "Nobody is going to follow somebody who doesn't believe we can succeed and with somebody who says that war where we are is a mistake.", "I know how these people think.", "I meet with them all the time.", "I talk to Tony Blair all the time.", "I talk to Silvio Berlusconi.", "They're not going to follow an American president who says follow me into a mistake.", "Our plan is working.", "We're going to make elections.", "And Iraq is going to be free, and America will be better off for it.", "Ladies and gentlemen, the right war was Osama bin Laden and Afghanistan.", "That was the right place.", "Now, everyone in the world knows that there were no weapons of mass destruction.", "Now we have to succeed.", "I've always said that.", "I have been consistent.", "Yes, we have to succeed, and I have a better plan to help us do it.", "And secondly, it's a fundamental misunderstanding to say that the war on terror is only Osama bin Laden.", "The war on terror is to make sure that these terrorist organizations do not end up with weapons of mass destruction.", "That's what the war on terror is about.", "Of course, we're going to find Osama bin Laden.", "We've already 75 percent of his people.", "And we're on the hunt for him.", "But this is a global conflict that requires firm resolve.", "I love our values.", "And I recognize I've made some decisions that have caused people to not understand the great values of our country.", "I remember when Ronald Reagan was the president; he stood on principle.", "Somebody called that stubborn.", "He stood on principle standing up to the Soviet Union, and we won that conflict.", "Yet at the same time, he was very -- we were very unpopular in Europe because of the decisions he made.", "I recognize that taking Saddam Hussein out was unpopular.", "But I made the decision because I thought it was in the right interests of our security.", "You know, I've made some decisions on Israel that's unpopular.", "And people in Europe didn't like that decision.", "I made a decision not to join the International Criminal Court in The Hague, which is where our troops could be brought to -- brought in front of a judge, an unaccounted judge.", "I don't think we ought to join that.", "That was unpopular.", "And so, what I'm telling you is, is that sometimes in this world you make unpopular decisions because you think they're right.", "We'll continue to reach out.", "Listen, there is 30 nations involved in Iraq, some 40 nations involved in Afghanistan.", "People love America.", "You don't want to join the International Criminal Court just because it's popular in certain capitals in Europe.", "Let me address it but also talk about the weapons the president just talked about, because every part of the president's answer just now promises you more of the same over the next four years.", "The president stood right here in this hall four years ago, and he was asked a question by somebody just like you, \"Under what circumstances would you send people to war?\"", "And his answer was, \"With a viable exit strategy and only with enough forces to get the job done.\"", "He didn't do that.", "He broke that promise.", "We didn't have enough forces.", "General Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, told him he was going to need several hundred thousand.", "They retired General Shinseki for telling him that.", "This president hasn't listened.", "I went to meet with the members of the Security Council in the week before we voted.", "I went to New York.", "I talked to all of them to find out how serious they were about really holding Saddam Hussein accountable.", "But the president just arbitrarily brought the hammer down and said, \"Nope.", "Sorry, time for diplomacy is over.", "We're going.\"", "He rushed to war without a plan to win the peace.", "Ladies and gentleman, he gave you a speech and told you he'd plan carefully, take every precaution, take our allies with us.", "He didn't.", "He broke his word.", " I remember sitting in the White House looking at those generals, saying, \"Do you have what you need in this war?", "Do you have what it takes?\"", "I remember going down to the basement of the White House the day we committed our troops as last resort, looking at Tommy Franks and the generals on the ground, asking them, \"Do we have the right plan with the right troop level?\"", "And they looked me in the eye and said, \"Yes, sir, Mr.", "President.\"", "Of course, I listen to our generals.", "That's what a president does.",

the peace.\"", "The military's job is to win the war.", "A president's job is to win the peace.", "The president did not do what was necessary.", "Didn't bring in enough nation.", "Didn't deliver the help.", "Didn't close off the borders.", "Didn't even guard the ammo dumps.", "And now our kids are being killed with ammos right out of that dump.", " I don't think you can just rely on U.N. sanctions, Randee.", "But you're absolutely correct, it is a threat, it's a huge threat.", "And what's interesting is, it's a threat that has grown while the president has been preoccupied with Iraq, where there wasn't a threat.", "Meanwhile, while Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons, some 37 tons of what they called yellow cake, the stuff they use to make enriched uranium, while they're doing that, North Korea has moved from one bomb maybe, maybe, to four to seven bombs.", "For two years, the president didn't even engage with North Korea, did nothing at all, while it was growing more

office.", "We've got to join with the British and the French, with the Germans, who've been involved, in their initiative.", "We've got to lead the world now to crack down on proliferation as a whole.", "But the president's been slow to do that, even in Russia.", "At his pace, it's going to take 13 years to reduce and get ahold of all the loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union.",

get other countries to give up their weapons when you're busy developing a new one.", "I'm going to lead the world in the greatest counterproliferation effort.", "And if we have to get tough with Iran, believe me, we will get tough.", "He keeps talking about, \"Let the inspectors do their job.\"", "It's naive and dangerous to say that.", "That's what the Duelfer report showed.", "He was deceiving the inspectors.", "Secondly, of course we've been involved with Iran.", "I fully understand the threat.", "And that's why we're doing what he suggested we do: Get the Brits, the Germans and the French to go make it very clear to the Iranians that if they expect to be a party to the world to give up their nuclear ambitions.", "We've been doing that.", "It is naive and dangerous to take a policy that he suggested the other day, which is to have bilateral relations with North Korea.", "Remember, he's the person who's accusing me of not acting multilaterally.", "He now wants to take the six-party talks we have -- China, North Korea, South Korea, Russia, Japan and the United States -- and undermine them by having bilateral talks.", "That's what President Clinton did.", "He had bilateral talks with the North Koreans.", "He didn't honor the agreement.", "He was enriching uranium.", "That is a bad policy.", "Of course, we're paying attention to these.", "That's why in my speech to the Congress I said: There's an \"Axis of Evil,\" Iraq, Iran and North Korea, and we're paying attention to it.", "And we're making progress.", "We're not going to have a draft, period.",

need mass armies anymore.", "One of the things we've done is we've taken the -- we're beginning to transform our military.", "And by that I mean we're moving troops out of Korea and replacing them with more effective weapons.", "We don't need as much manpower on the Korean Peninsula to keep a deterrent.", "And so we're moving troops out of Europe and replacing it with more effective equipment.", "One of the more important things we're doing in this administration is transformation.", "There are some really interesting technologies.", "For instance, we're flying unmanned vehicles that can send real- time messages back to stations in the United States.", "That saves manpower, and it saves equipment.", "It also means that we can target things easier and move more quickly, which means we need to be lighter and quicker and more facile and highly trained.", "We're not going to have a draft so long as I am the president.", " Daniel, I don't support a draft.", "The president --

of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; General Tony McPeak, who ran the air war for the president's father and did a brilliant job, supporting me; General Wes Clark, who won the war in Kosovo, supporting me;

here.", "Now, I'm going to add 40,000 active duty forces to the military, and I'm going to make people feel good about being safe in our military, and not overextended, because I'm going to run a
