might consider.", "It's been looked, When I was chairman of the finance committee which handled Social Security we looked at all these options, and one thing we've got to make certain, when I used to

people to live on, or at least is not enough for them to maintain anything like their previous lifestyle.", "So we've got to figure out how are we going to have more people with pension plans, and pension coverage has been declining as more and more people work for small businesses and fewer people work for big businesses.", "So what, what is in my plan and I think it's almost identical in Senator Dole's plans is we make more people eligible to save in an IRA and let couples, married couples save more and then they could withdraw from it tax-free if they needed to, for medical emergencies or buy a home or education, but they could also save to supplement retirement.", "In addition to that, we just passed a sweeping small business reform that makes it easier for small business people to take out 401 K plans for themselves and employees and much easier for employees to carry it from job to job.", "My best friend from grade school is a computer software salesman and he told me last time he changed employers it took him nine months to figure out how to transfer his 401K plan.", "Now none of that will happen anymore.", "I hope over the next ten years you will see a big increase over the percentage of people that have pension plans, plus a secure Social Security system.", " See, the first thing we have to do is get you a job.", "And that's the economic package again.", "Create jobs and opportunities.", "Reduce the capital gains rate.", "Reduce regulatory reform.", "Stop some of this senseless litigation and let people work in America.", "And I think that's that's the thrust we will make.", "Obviously if Social Security is a very important program, it should -- it will be preserved.", "Democrats or Republicans, it will be preserved.", "We want to make certain we protect those in the pipeline just as we did back in 1983 and we did it on a bipartisan basis.", "We took it out of politics.", "people get so tired of politics.", "We ought to do the same

largest number in American history -- not just the big ones you read about, but a lot of smaller ones.", "And now what we have to do is to focus on those things we're real good at and make sure we're getting a fair deal.", "So we have -- as we said, if you want to keep doing business and selling your products over here, you're going to have to quit pirating our CDs, and they agreed to do things and verify that they had done it, which will make the problem much better.", "You have to work on this day in and day out, every month ,every year, every issue, to make sure that we have not only free trade but fair trade.", "I'm proud that we're better off on that than we were four years ago.", " Well no doubt about it, our founding fathers had a great deal of wisdom.", "Honor, duty, and country,

to collect files, in Watergate -- I know a person who went to jail for looking at one file, one FBI file.", "There are 900 sequestered in the White House.", "Why should they be rifling through your files?", "The president has a great responsibility.", "That's one that I understand and certainly will carry out.", " This is the most religious, great country in history.", "And yet, interestingly enough, we have the most religious freedom of any country in the world, including the freedom not to believe.", "I have supported character education programs in our schools, drug-free schools

have to do, give people like you and our families the power to give those values to our children.", " I think it's -- before I came in, my wife and daughter and I had a prayer.", "Because it's God's will, whatever happens.", "It's God's will, it'll happen.", "The constitutional amendment for voluntary prayer in school, in my view would be a great idea.", " the president opposes it.", "It seems to

view, is making -- is making our future less certain and less secure.", "First of all, the sequester is not something that I've proposed.", "It is something that Congress has proposed.", "It will not happen.", "The budget that we are talking about is not reducing our military spending.", "It is maintaining it.", "But I think Governor Romney maybe hasn't spent enough time looking at how our military works.", "You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916.", "We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them.", "We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines.", " And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we're counting slips.", "It's what are our capabilities.", "And so when I sit down with the

clear when I came into office.", "Their currency has dropped 80 percent.", "Their oil production has plunged to the lowest level since they were fighting a war with Iraq 20 years ago.", "So their economy is in a shambles.", "And the reason we did this is because a nuclear Iran is a threat to our national security, and it is a threat to Israel's national security.", "We cannot afford to have a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world.", "Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism.", "And for them to be able to provide nuclear technology to non-state actors, that's unacceptable.", "And they have said that they want to see Israel wiped off the map.", "So the work that we've done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice.", "They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a United States president, me, who said we're not going to take any options off the table.", "The disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that, during the course of this campaign, he's often talked as if we should take premature military action.", "And if Israel is attacked, we have their back, not just diplomatically, not just culturally, but militarily.", "It presents a threat not only to our friends but ultimately a threat to us to have Iran have nuclear material, nuclear weapons that could be used against us or used to be threatening to us.", " It is also essential for us to understand what our mission is in Iran, and that is to dissuade Iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means.", "And crippling sanctions are something I called for five years ago, when I was in Israel, speaking at the Herzliya Conference.", "I laid out seven steps, crippling sanctions were number one.", "And they do work.", "You're seeing it right now in the economy.", "It's absolutely the right thing to do, to have crippling sanctions.", "I would have put them in place earlier.",

imagine the E.U.", "would agree with us as well.", "Not only ships couldn't, but I'd say companies that are moving their oil can't, people who are trading in their oil can't.", "I would tighten those sanctions further.", "Secondly, I'd take on diplomatic isolation efforts.", "I'd make sure that Ahmadinejad is indicted under the Genocide Convention.", "His words amount to genocide incitation.", "I would indict him for it.", "I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world.", "The same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of South Africa.", "And of course, a military action is the last resort.", "It is something one would only - only consider if all of the other avenues had been -- had been tried to their full extent.", "They are not true.", "But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been in place.", "There -- there are people in Iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world for a better life.", "And it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking.", "It's meticulous.", "We started from the day we got into office.", "And the reason is was so important -- and this is a testament to how we've restored American credibility and strength around the world -- is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like Russia and China.", "It's because we got everybody to agree that Iran is seeing so much pressure.", "And we've got to maintain that pressure.", "There is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established.", "They convince the international community they are not pursuing a nuclear program.", "There are inspections that are very intrusive.", "But over time, what they can do is regain credibility.", "In the meantime, though, we're not going to let up the pressure until we have clear evidence that that takes place.", "The clock is ticking.", "We're not going to allow Iran to perpetually engage in negotiations that lead nowhere.", "And I've been very clear to them.", "You know, because of the intelligence coordination that we do with a range of countries, including Israel, we have a sense of when they would get breakout capacity, which means that we would not be able to intervene in time to stop their nuclear program.", "And that clock is ticking.", "And we're going to make sure that if they do not meet the demands of the international community, then we are going to take all options necessary to make sure they don't have a nuclear weapon.", " I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges we've had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration, and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be.", "I think they saw weakness where they had expected to find American strength.", "And I say that because from the very beginning, the president in his campaign four years ago, said he would meet with all the world's worst actors in his first year, he'd sit down with Chavez and Kim Jong-il, with Castro and President Ahmadinejad of Iran.", "And I think they looked and thought, well, that's an unusual honor to receive from the President of the United States.", "And then the president began what I have called an apology tour, of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America.", "I think they looked at that and saw weakness.", "Then when there were dissidents in the streets of Tehran, a Green Revolution, holding signs saying, is America with us, the president was silent.", "I think they noticed that as well.", "And I think that when the president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel, that they noticed that as well.", "All of these things suggested, I think, to the Iranian mullahs that, hey, you know, we can keep on pushing along here, we can keep talks going on, we're just going to keep on spinning centrifuges.", "Now there are some 10,000 centrifuges spinning uranium, preparing to create a nuclear threat to the United States and to the world.", "And an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to us.", "They must not develop nuclear capability.", "And the way to make sure they understand that is by having, from the very beginning, the tightest sanctions possible.", "They need to be tightened.", "Our diplomatic isolation needs to be tougher.", "We need to indict Ahmadinejad.", "Nothing Governor Romney just said is true, starting with this notion of me apologizing.", "This has been probably the biggest whopper that's been told during the course of this campaign.", "And every fact checker and every reporter who's looked at it, Governor, has said this is not true.", "And the fact is, while we were coordinating an international coalition to make sure these sanctions were effective, you were still invested in a Chinese state oil company that was doing business with the Iranian oil sector.", "And with respect to our attitude about the Iranian revolution, I was very clear about the murderous activities that had taken place and that was contrary to international law and everything that civilized people stand for.", "And -- and so the strength that we have shown in Iran is shown by the fact that we've been able to mobilize the world.", "When I came into office, the world was divided.", "Iran was resurgent.", "Iran is at its weakest point, economically, strategically, militarily, then since -- then in many years.", "And we are going to continue to keep the pressure on to make sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon.", " We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.", "And -- and -- we should not have wasted these four years to the extent they -- they continue to be able to spin these centrifuges and get that much closer.", "And by the way, you skipped Israel, our closest friend in the region, but you went to the other nations.", "And then in those nations, and on Arabic TV, you said that America had been dismissive and derisive.", "You said that on occasion America had dictated to other nations.", "Mr. President, America has not dictated to other nations.", "We have freed other nations from dictators.", "If we're going to talk about trips that we've taken -- when I was a candidate for office, first trip I took was to visit our troops.", "And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn't take donors.", "I didn't attend fundraisers.", "I went to Yad Beshef (ph), the Holocaust museum there, to remind myself the nature of evil and why our bond with Israel will be unbreakable.", "And then I went down to the border towns of Storok (ph), which had experienced missiles raining dowm from Hamas.", "And I saw families there who showed me there where missiles had come down near their children's bedrooms.", "And I was reminded of what that would mean if those were my kids.", "Which is why as president, we funded an Iron Dome program to stop those missiles.", " So that's how I've used my travels, when I travel to Israel and when I travel to the region.", "And they can look at my track record, whether it's Iran sanctions, whether it's dealing with counterterrorism, whether it's supporting democracy, whether it's supporting women's rights, whether it's supporting religious minorities.", "And they can say that the President of the United States and the United States of America has stood on the right side of history.", "And that kind of credibility is precisely why we've been able to show leadership on a wide range of issues facing the world right now.", "Our relationship with Israel, my relationship with the prime minister of Israel is such that we would not get a call saying our bombers are on the way, or their fighters are on the way.", "This is the kind of thing that would have been discussed and thoroughly evaluated well before that kind of -- (CROSSTALK)", "Let's come back to what the president was speaking about, which is what's happening in the world and the president's statement that things are going so well.", "Look, I look at what's happening around the world, and i see Iran four years closer to a bomb.", "I see the Middle East with a rising tide of violence, chaos, tumult.", "I see jihadists continuing to spread, whether they're rising or just about the same level, hard to precisely measure, but it's clear they're there.", "They're very strong.", "I see Syria with 30,000 civilians dead, Assad still in power.", "I see our trade deficit with China, larger than it's -- growing larger every year, as a matter of fact.", "I look around the world and I don't feel that you see North Korea, continuing to export their nuclear technology, Russia said they're not going to follow Nunn-Lugar any more.", "They're back away from a nuclear proliferation treaty that we had with them.", " I look around the world, I don't see our influence growing around the world.", "I see our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the president to deal with our economic challenges at home; in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way I think it ought to be; in part because of the -- the -- the turmoil with Israel.", "I mean, the president received a letter from 38 Democrat senators saying the tensions with Israel were a real problem.", "They asked him, please repair the tension -- Democrat senators -- please repair the tension...", " ... the damage in his -- in his own party.", " Governor, the problem is, is that on a whole range of issues, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's Afghanistan, whether it's Iraq, whether it's now Iran, you've been all over the map.", "I mean, I'm -- I'm pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear program.", "But just a few years ago you said that's something you'd never do.", "In the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in Afghanistan, now you're for it, although it depends.", "In the same way that you say you would have ended the war in Iraq, but recently gave a speech saying that we should have 20,000 more folks in there.", "The same way that you said that it was mission creep to go after Gadhafi.", "When it comes to going after Osama bin Laden, you said, well, any president would make that call.", "But when you were a candidate in 2008, as I was, and I said if I got bin Laden in our sights I would take that shot, you said we shouldn't move heaven and earth to get one man.", " And you said we should ask Pakistan for permission.", "And if we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him.", "And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him.", "You know, after we killed bin Laden I was at ground zero for a memorial and talked to a young women who was four years old when 9/11 happened.", "And the last conversation she had with her father was him calling from the twin towers, saying \"Peyton (ph), I love you and I will always watch over you.\"", "And for the next decade, she was haunted by that conversation.", "And she said to me, \"You know, by finally getting bin Laden, that brought some closure to me.\"", "And when we do things like that -- when we bring those who have harmed us to justice, that sends a message to the world and it tells Peyton (ph) that we did not forget her father.", "And I make that point because that's the kind of clarity of leadership, and those decisions are not always popular.", "Those decisions generally -- generally are not poll-tested.", "And even some in my own party, including my current vice president, had the same critique as you did.", "But what the American people understand is that I look at what we need to get done to keep the American people safe and to move our interests forward, and I make those decisions.", " Well, we're going to be finished by 2014, and when I'm president, we'll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014.", "The commanders and the generals there are on track to do so.", "We've seen progress over the past several years.", "The surge has been successful and the training program is proceeding apace.", "So our troops will come home at that point.", "I can tell you at the same time, that we will make sure that we look at what's happening in Pakistan, and recognize that what's happening in Pakistan is going to have a major impact on the success in Afghanistan.", "And I say that because I know a lot of people that feel like we should just brush our hands and walk away.", "And I don't mean you, Mr. President, but some people in the -- in our nation feel that Pakistan is being nice to us, and that we should walk away fro mthem.", "They'll have more than Great Britain sometime in the -- in the relatively near future.", "They also have the Haqqani Network and the Taliban existent within their country.", "And so a Pakistan that falls apart, becomes a failed state, would be of extraordinary danger to Afghanistan and to us.", "And so we're going to have to remain helpful in encouraging Pakistan to move towards a more stable government and rebuild the relationship with us.", "And that means that our aid that we provide to Pakistan is going to have to be conditioned upon certain benchmarks being met.", " When I came into office, we were still bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan had been drifting for a decade.", "We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on Afghanistan, and we did deliver a surge of troops.", "That was facilitated in part because we had ended the war in Iraq.", "And we are now in a position where we have met many of the objectives that got us there in the first place.", "Part of what had happened is we'd forgotten why we had gone.", "We went because there were people who were responsible for 3,000 American deaths.", "And so we decimated Al Qaida's core leadership in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan.", "We then started to build up Afghan forces.", "Now, that transition has to take place in a responsible fashion.", "But what I think the American people recognize is after a decade of war it's time to do some nation building here at home.", "And what we can now do is free up some resources, to, for example, put Americans back to work, especially our veterans, rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our schools, making sure that, you know, our veterans are getting the care that they need when it comes to post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, making sure that the certifications that they need for good jobs of the future are in place.", " You know, I was having lunch with some -- a veteran in Minnesota who had been a medic dealing with the most extreme circumstances.", "When he came home and he wanted to become a nurse, he had to start from scratch.", "The first lady has done great work with an organization called Joining Forces putting our veterans back to work.", "And as a consequence, veterans' unemployment is actually now lower than general population.", "It was higher when I came into office.", "So those are the kinds of things that we can now do because we're making that transition in Afghanistan.", "It's a nation that's not like -- like others and it does not have a civilian leadership that is calling the shots there.", "You have the ISI, their intelligence organization, is probably the most powerful of the -- of three branches there.", "Then you have the military and then you have the civilian government.", "This is a nation, which, if it falls apart, if it -- if it becomes a failed state, there are nuclear weapons there and you've got -- you've got terrorists there who could grab their -- their hands onto those nuclear weapons.", " This is -- this is an important part of the world for us.", "Pakistan is -- is technically an ally, and they're not acting very much like an ally right now.", "But we have some work to do.", "And I -- I don't blame the administration for the fact that the relationship with Pakistan is strained.", "We -- we had to go into Pakistan.", "We had to go in there to get Osama bin Laden.", "That was the right thing to do.", "And -- and that upset them, but obviously there was a great deal of anger even before that.", "But we're going to have to work with the -- with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that they're on.", "And it's important for them.", "It's important for the nuclear weapons.", "It's important for the success of Afghanistan.", "Because inside Pakistan, you have a -- a large group of Pashtun that are -- that are Taliban.", "They're going to come rushing back in to Afghanistan when we go.", "And that's one of the reasons the Afghan Security Forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that.", "But we do need to make sure that as we -- as we send support for them, that this is tied to them making progress on -- on matters that would lead them to becoming a civil society.", " Well I believe we should use any and all means necessary to take out people who pose a threat to us and our friends around the world.", "But let me also note that as I said earlier, we're going to have to do more than just going after leaders and -- and killing bad guys, important as that is.", " We're also going to have to have a farm more effective and comprehensive strategy to help move the world away from terror and Islamic extremism.", "We haven't done that yet.", "We talk a lot about these things, but you look at the -- the record, you look at the record.", "You look at the record of the last four years and say is Iran closer to a bomb?", "Yes.", "Is the Middle East in tumult?", "Is -- is al-Qaida on the run, on its heels?", "No.", "Is -- are Israel and the Palestinians closer to reaching a peace agreement?", "No, they haven't had talks in two years.", "We have not seen the progress we need to have, and I'm convinced that with strong leadership and an effort to build a strategy based upon helping these nations reject extremism, we can see the kind of peace and prosperity the world demands.", " Well, keep in mind our strategy wasn't just going after bin Laden.", "We created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan.", "And what we've also done is engaged these governments in the kind of reforms that are actually going to make a difference in people's lives day to day, to make sure that their governments aren't corrupt, to make sure that they're treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown and to make sure that they've got a free market system that works.", "So across the board, we are engaging them in building capacity in these countries.", "And we have stood on the side of democracy.", "One thing I think Americans should be proud of, when Tunisians began to protest, this nation -- me, my administration -- stood with them earlier than just about any country.", "In Egypt we stood on the side of democracy.", "In Libya we stood on the side of the people.", "But there are always going to be elements in these countries that potentially threaten the United States.", "And we want to shrink those groups and those networks and we can do that.", " But we're always also going to have to maintain vigilance when it comes to terrorist activities.", "The truth, though, is that Al Qaeda is much weaker than it was when I came into office.", "And they don't have the same capacities to attack the U.S. homeland and our allies as they did four years ago.", " Well, I think it will continue to be terrorist networks.", "So my attitude coming into office was that we are going to insist that China plays by the same rules as everybody else.", "I know Americans had seen jobs being shipped overseas; businesses and workers not getting a level playing field when it came to trade.", "And that's the reason why I set up a trade task force to go after cheaters when it came to international trade.", "That's the reason why we have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the other -- the previous administration had done in two terms.", "And we've won just about every case that we've filed, that has been decided.", " In fact, just recently steelworkers in Ohio and throughout the Midwest -- Pennsylvania -- are in a position now to sell steel to China because we won that case.", "We had a tire case in which they were flooding us with cheap domestic tires -- or -- or cheap Chinese tires.", "I have to say that Governor Romney criticized me for being too tough in that tire case; said this wouldn't be good for American workers and that it would be protectionist.", "But I tell you, those workers don't feel that way.", "They feel as if they had finally an administration who was going to take this issue seriously.", "Over the long term, in order for us to compete with China, we've also got to make sure, though, that we're taking -- taking care of business here at home.", "If we don't have the best education system in the world, if we don't continue to put money into research and technology that will allow us to create great businesses here in the United States, that's how we lose the competition.", "And, unfortunately, Governor Romney's budget and his proposals would not allow us to make those investments.", "It's not government investments that makes businesses grow and hire people.", "Let me also note that the greatest threat that the world faces, the greatest national security threat is a nuclear Iran.", "They don't want war.", "They don't want to see protectionism.", "So they want the economy to work and the world to be free and open.", "And so we can be a partner with China.", "We don't have to be an adversary in any way, shape or form.", "The secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.", "It's not my term, it's the president's own secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.", "It's not my term, it's the president's own Secretary of Defense, called them devastating.", "And the answer is, yes, if I'm president, America will be very strong.", "We'll also make sure that we have trade relations with China that work for us.", "I've watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and people have lost their jobs because China has not played by the same rules, in part by holding down artificially the value of their currency.", "It holds down the prices of their goods.", "It means our goods aren't as competitive and we lose jobs.", "That's got to end.", "That's why on day one, i will label them a currency manipulator, which allows us to apply tariffs where they're taking jobs.", "They're stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our goods.", "They have to understand we want to trade with them.", "We want a world that's stable.", " Well, they sell us about this much stuff every year, and we sell them about this much stuff every year.", "So it's pretty clear who doesn't want a trade war.", "And there's one going on right now, which we don't know about it.", "It's a silent one.", "And they're winning.", "We have enormous trade imbalance with China, and it's worse this year than last year, and it's worse last year than the year before.", "And so we have to understand that we can't just surrender and lose jobs year in and year out.", "We have to say to our friend in China, look, you guys are playing aggressively.", "We understand it.", "But this can't keep on going.", "You can't keep on holding down the value of your currency, stealing our intellectual property, counterfeiting our products, selling them around the world, even to the United States.", "I was with one company that makes valves and -- and process industries and they said, look, we were -- we were having some valves coming in that -- that were broken and we had to repair them under warranty and we looked them and -- and they had our serial number on them.", "And then we noticed that there was more than one with that same serial number.", "They were counterfeit products being made overseas with the same serial number as a U.S. company, the same packaging, these were being sold into our market and around the world as if they were made by the U.S. competitor.", "This can't go on.", "I want a great relationship with China.", "China can be our partner, but -- but that doesn't mean they can just roll all over us and steal our jobs on an unfair basis.", "I mean that's how our free market works.", "But I've made a different bet on American workers.", "If we had taken your advice Governor Romney about our auto industry, we'd be buying cars from China instead of selling cars to China.", "If we take your advice with respect to how we change our tax codes so that companies that earn profits overseas don't pay U.S. taxes compared to companies here that are paying taxes.", "Now with respect to what we've done with China already, U.S. exports have doubled since I came into office, to China and actually currencies are at their most advantageous point for U.S. exporters since 1993.", "And when it comes to our military and Chinese security, part of the reason that we were able to pivot to the Asia-Pacific region after having ended the war in Iraq and transitioning out of Afghanistan, is precisely because this is going to be a massive growth area in the future.", "And we believe China can be a partner, but we're also sending a very clear signal that America is a Pacific power; that we are going to have a presence there.", "We are working with countries in the region to make sure, for example, that ships can pass through; that commerce continues.", "And we're organizing trade relations with countries other than China so that China starts feeling more pressure about meeting basic international standards.", "That's the kind of leadership we've shown in the region.", "That's the kind of leadership that we'll continue to show.", "Nothing could be further from the truth.", "I'm a son of Detroit.", "I was born in Detroit.", "My dad was head of a car company.", "I like American cars.", "And I would do nothing to hurt the U.S. auto industry.", "My plan to get the industry on its feet when it was in real trouble was not to start writing checks.", "It was President Bush that wrote the first checks.", "I disagree with that.", "I said they need -- these companies need to go through a managed bankruptcy.", "And in that process, they can get government help and government guarantees, but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that they'd -- they'd built up.", " You did not say that you would provide government help.", "Under no circumstances would I do anything other than to help this industry get on its feet.", "And the idea that has been suggested that I would liquidate the industry, of course not.", "Of course not.", " I have never said I would liquidate... (CROSSTALK)", " ...I would liquidate the industry.", " ...and -- and that's why I have the kind of commitment to ensure that our industries in this country can compete and be successful.", "We in this country can -- can compete successfully with anyone in the world, and we're going to.", "We're going to have to have a president, however, that doesn't think that somehow the government investing in -- in car companies like Tesla and -- and Fisker, making electric battery cars.", "Investing in Solyndra.", "I -- I want to invest in research.", "Research is great.", "Providing funding to universities and think tanks is great.", "But investing in companies?", "Absolutely not.", " That's the wrong way to go.", "So I want to make sure that we make -- we make America more competitive.", " And that we do those things that make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, innovators, businesses to grow.", "But you're investing in companies doesn't do that.", "In fact it makes it less likely for them to come here...", " ...because the private sector's not going to invest in a... (CROSSTALK)", "Governor Romney, you keep on trying to, you know airbrush history here.", "You were very clear that you would not provide, government assistance to the U.S. auto companies, even if they went through bankruptcy.", "You said that they could get it in the private marketplace.", "That wasn't true.", " No, I am not wrong.", " People will look it up.", "Cutting our education budget, that's not a smart choice.", "That will not help us compete with China.", "Cutting our investments in research and technology, that's not a smart choice.", "Bringing down our deficit by adding $7 trillion of tax cuts and military spending that our military is not asking for, before we even get to the debt that we currently have, that is not going to make us more competitive.", "Having a tax code that rewards companies that are shipping jobs overseas instead of companies that are investing here in the United States, that will not make us more competitive.", "And the one thing that I'm absolutely clear about is that after a decade in which we saw drift, jobs being shipped overseas, nobody championing American workers and American businesses, we've now begun to make some real progress.", "What we can't do is go back to the same policies that got us into such difficulty in the first place.", "That's why we have to move forward and not go back.", " I couldn't agree more about going forward, but I certainly don't want to go back to the policies of the last four years.", "The policies of the last four years have seen incomes in America decline every year for middle income families, now down $4,300 during your term.", "Twenty-three million Americans still struggling to find a good job.", "When you came to office 32 million people on food stamps.", "Today, 47 million people on food stamps.", "When you came to office, just over $10 trillion in debt, now $16 trillion in debt.", "It hasn't worked.", "You said by now we'd be at 5.4 percent unemployment.", "We're 9 million jobs short of that.", "I've met some of those people.", "I've met them in Appleton, Wisconsin.", "I met a young woman in -- in Philadelphia who's coming out of -- out of college, can't find work.", "I've been -- Ann was with someone just the other day that was just weeping about not being able to get work.", "It's just a tragedy in a nation so prosperous as ours, that the last four years have been so hard.", "And that's why it's so critical, that we make America once again the most attractive place in the world to start businesses, to build jobs, to grow the economy.", "And that's not going to happen by just hiring teachers.", "Look, I love to -- I love teachers, and I'm happy to have states and communities that want to hire teachers do that.", "By the way, I don't like to have the federal government start pushing its weight deeper and deeper into our schools.", "Let the states and localities do that.", "I was a governor.", "The federal government didn't hire our teachers.", "But I want to get our private sector growing and I know how to do it.", "Over the last four years we've made real progress digging our way out of policies that gave us two prolonged wars, record deficits and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.", "And Governor Romney wants to take us back to those policies, a foreign policy that's wrong and reckless, economic policies that won't create jobs, won't reduce our deficit, but will make sure that folks at the very top don't have to play by the same rules that you do.", "And I've got a different vision for America.", "I want to build on our strengths.", "I want to make sure we've got the best education system in the world.", "And we're retaining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow.", "I want to control our own energy by developing oil and natural gas but also the energy sources of the future.", "As Commander in Chief, I will maintain the strongest military in the world, keep faith with our troops and go after those who would do us harm.", "I will fight for your families and I will work every single day to make sure that America continues to be the greatest nation on earth.", "I'm optimistic about the future.", "I'm excited about our prospects as a nation.", "I want to see peace.", "I want to see growing peace in this country.", "It's our objective.", "We have an opportunity to have real leadership.", "America's going to have that kind of leadership and continue to promote principles of peace to make a world a safer place and make people in this country more confident that their future is secure.", "I also want to make sure that we get this economy going.", "One is a path represented by the president, which at the end of four years would mean we'd have $20 trillion in debt heading towards Greece.", "I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.", "The president's path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay.", "I want to make sure our take-home pay turns around and starts to grow.", "I want to make sure take-home pay turns around and starts to grow.", "The president's path means 20 million people out of work struggling for a good job.", "I'll get people back to work with 12 million new jobs.", "I'm going to make sure that we get people off of food stamps, not by cutting the program, but by getting them good jobs.", "I was in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat.", "I learned how to get along on the other side of the aisle.", "We've got to do that in Washington.", "Washington is broken.", "I know what it takes to get this country back, and will work with good Democrats and good Republicans to do that.", "This nation is the hope of the earth.", "We've been blessed by having a nation that's free and prosperous thanks to the contributions of the greatest generation.",

"I'll work with you.", "I'll lead you in an open and honest way, and I ask for your vote.", "I think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.", "And the financial rescue plan that Senator McCain and I supported is an important first step.", "And I pushed for some core principles: making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they're putting money up.", "Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process.", "And I think that it's going to take some time to work itself out.", "But what we haven't yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class.", "Because the fundamentals of the economy were weak even before this latest crisis.", "Number one, let's focus on jobs.", "I want to end the tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and provide a tax credit for every company that's creating a job right here in America.", "Number two, let's help families right away by providing them a tax cut -- a middle-class tax cut for people making less than $200,000, and let's allow them to access their IRA accounts without penalty if they're experiencing a crisis.", "Now Senator McCain and I agree with your idea that we've got to help homeowners.", "That's why we included in the financial package a proposal to get homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate their mortgages.", "And we don't want to waste taxpayer money.", "And we've got to get the financial package working much quicker than it has been working.", "We've got some long-term challenges in this economy that have to be dealt with.", "We've got to fix our energy policy that's giving our wealth away.", "We've got to fix our health care system and we've got to invest in our education system for every young person to be able to learn.", " He has been watching ads of Senator McCain's.", "I think tax policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself.", "And we both want to cut taxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes for.", "Now, Senator McCain, the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in America.", "Exxon Mobil, and other oil companies, for example, would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.", "What I've said is I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of working Americans, 95 percent.", "If you make more -- if you make less than a quarter million dollars a year, then you will not see your income tax go up, your capital gains tax go up, your payroll tax.", "Not one dime.", "And 95 percent of working families, 95 percent of you out there, will get a tax cut.", "In fact, independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than Senator McCain does.", " Now, the conversation I had with Joe the plumber, what I essentially said to him was, \"Five years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then.\"", "And what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who doesn't yet have money, I want to give them a tax break now.", "And that requires us to make some important choices.", "They produce the most jobs.", "Number one, I want to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans.", "Now, it is true that my friend and supporter, Warren Buffett, for example, could afford to pay a little more in taxes in order...", " ... in order to give -- in order to give additional tax cuts to Joe the plumber before he was at the point where he could make $250,000.", "But ultimately, we've got to pay for the core investments that make this economy strong and somebody's got to do it.", " Well, I don't mind paying a little more.", " Well, first of all, I think it's important for the American public to understand that the $750 billion rescue package, if it's structured properly, and, as president, I will make sure it's structured properly, means that ultimately taxpayers get their money back, and that's important to understand.", "Every dollar that I've proposed, I've proposed an additional cut so that it matches.", " And some of the cuts, just to give you an example, we spend $15 billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies.", "It doesn't -- under the Medicare plan -- it doesn't help seniors get any better.", "It's not improving our health care system.", "It's just a giveaway.", "We need to eliminate a whole host of programs that don't work.", "And I want to go through the federal budget line by line, page by page, programs that don't work, we should cut.", "Programs that we need, we should make them work better.", "And we're going to have to embrace a culture and an ethic of responsibility, all of us, corporations, the federal government, and individuals out there who may be living beyond their means.", " Well, look, I think that we do have a disagreement about an across-the-board spending freeze.", "It sounds good.", "It's proposed periodically.", "It doesn't happen.", "There are some programs that are underfunded.", "And I want to make sure that we are focused on those programs that work.", "Now, Senator McCain talks a lot about earmarks.", "That's one of the centerpieces of his campaign.", "Earmarks account for 0.5 percent of the total federal budget.", "But it's not going to solve the problem.", "When President Bush came into office, we had a budget surplus and the national debt was a little over $5 trillion.", "It has doubled over the last eight years.", " And we are now looking at a deficit of well over half a trillion dollars.", "So one of the things that I think we have to recognize is pursuing the same kinds of policies that we pursued over the last eight years is not going to bring down the deficit.", "And, frankly, Senator McCain voted for four out of five of President Bush's budgets.", "We've got to take this in a new direction, that's what I propose as president.", "First of all, in terms of standing up to the leaders of my party, the first major bill that I voted on in the Senate was in support of tort reform, which wasn't very popular with trial lawyers, a major constituency in the Democratic Party.", " I support charter schools and pay for performance for teachers.", "Doesn't make me popular with the teachers union.", "I support clean coal technology.", "Doesn't make me popular with environmentalists.", "So I've got a history of reaching across the aisle.", "Now with respect to a couple of things Senator McCain said, the notion that I voted for a tax increase for people making $42,000 a year has been disputed by everybody who has looked at this claim that Senator McCain keeps on making.", "Even FOX News disputes it, and that doesn't happen very often when it comes to accusations about me.", "Now, you've shown independence -- commendable independence, on some key issues like torture, for example, and I give you enormous credit for that.", "But when it comes to economic policies, essentially what you're proposing is eight more years of the same thing.", "And it hasn't worked.", "And I think the American people understand it hasn't worked.", "We need to move in a new direction.", "I think that, if you look at the record and the impressions of the American people -- Bob, your network just did a poll, showing that two-thirds of the American people think that Senator McCain is running a negative campaign versus one-third of mine.", "And 100 percent, John, of your ads -- 100 percent of them have been negative.", " It absolutely is true.", "And, now, I think the American people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of the campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply.", "And there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like we're having tonight about health care, about energy policy, about tax policy.", "That's the stuff that campaigns should be made of.", "The notion, though, that because we're not doing town hall meetings that justifies some of the ads that have been going up, not just from your own campaign directly, John, but 527s and other organizations that make some pretty tough accusations, well, I don't mind being attacked for the next three weeks.", "What the American people can't afford, though, is four more years of failed economic policies.", "And what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about what's most pressing to them: the economic crisis.", "Senator McCain's own campaign said publicly last week that, if we keep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to change the subject.", "And I would love to see the next three weeks devoted to talking about the economy, devoted to talking about health care, devoted to talking about energy, and figuring out how the American people can send their kids to college.", "And that is something that I would welcome.", "But it requires, I think, a recognition that politics as usual, as been practiced over the last several years, is not solving the big problems here in America.", " I mean, look, if we want to talk about Congressman Lewis, who is an American hero, he, unprompted by my campaign, without my campaign's awareness, made a statement that he was troubled with what he was hearing at some of the rallies that your running mate was holding, in which all the Republican reports indicated were shouting, when my name came up, things like \"terrorist\" and \"kill him,\" and that you're running mate didn't mention, didn't stop, didn't say \"Hold on a second, that's kind of out of line.\"", "And I think Congressman Lewis' point was that we have to be careful about how we deal with our supporters.", "And, in fact, afterwards, Congressman Lewis put out a similar statement, saying that he had probably gone over the line.", "The important point here is, though, the American people have become so cynical about our politics, because all they see is a tit- for-tat and back-and-forth.", " And what is important is making sure that we disagree without being disagreeable.", "And it means that we can have tough, vigorous debates around issues.", "What we can't do, I think, is try to characterize each other as bad people.", "And that has been a culture in Washington that has been taking place for too long.", "In fact, Mr. Ayers has become the centerpiece of Senator McCain's campaign over the last two or three weeks.", "This has been their primary focus.", "So let's get the record straight.", "Bill Ayers is a professor of education in Chicago.", "Forty years ago, when I was 8 years old, he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group.", "I have roundly condemned those acts.", "Ten years ago he served and I served on a school reform board that was funded by one of Ronald Reagan's former ambassadors and close friends, Mr. Annenberg.", "Other members on that board were the presidents of the University of Illinois, the president of Northwestern University, who happens to be a Republican, the president of The Chicago Tribune, a Republican- leaning newspaper.", "Mr. Ayers is not involved in my campaign.", "He has never been involved in this campaign.", "And he will not advise me in the White House.", "Apparently what they've done is they were paying people to go out and register folks, and apparently some of the people who were out there didn't really register people, they just filled out a bunch of names.", "It had nothing to do with us.", "We were not involved.", "The only involvement I've had with ACORN was I represented them alongside the U.S. Justice Department in making Illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at DMVs.", "On economic policy, I associate with Warren Buffett and former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker.", "Those are the people, Democrats and Republicans, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House.", "And I think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, Senator McCain, says more about your campaign than it says about me.", " That's absolutely not true.", " And that's not the facts.", " Well, Joe Biden, I think, is one of the finest public servants that has served in this country.", "It's not just that he has some of the best foreign policy credentials of anybody.", "And Democrats and Republicans alike, I think, acknowledge his expertise there.", "But it's also that his entire life he has never forgotten where he came from, coming from Scranton, fighting on behalf of working families, remembering what it's like to see his father lose his job and go through a downward spiral economically.", "And, as a consequence, his consistent pattern throughout his career is to fight for the little guy.", "That's what he's done when it comes to economic policies that will help working families get a leg up.", "That's what he's done when it comes to, for example, passing the landmark 1994 crime bill, the Violence Against Women's Act.", "So, on the key issues that are of importance to American families, Joe Biden's always been on the right side, and I think he will make an outstanding president if, heaven forbid, something happened to me.", "I think that, obviously, she's a capable politician who has, I think, excited the -- a base in the Republican Party.", "And I think it's very commendable the work she's done on behalf of special needs.", "I agree with that, John.", "That is something that every family that advocates on behalf of disabled children talk about.", "And if we have an across-the-board spending freeze, we're not going to be able to do it.", "That's an example of, I think, the kind of use of the scalpel that we want to make sure that we're funding some of those programs.", " I think that in ten years, we can reduce our dependence so that we no longer have to import oil from the Middle East or Venezuela.", "I think that's about a realistic timeframe.", "And this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face.", "Obviously, we've got an immediate crisis right now.", "But nothing is more important than us no longer borrowing $700 billion or more from China and sending it to Saudi Arabia.", "It's mortgaging our children's future.", "Now, from the start of this campaign, I've identified this as one of my top priorities and here is what I think we have to do.", "And I think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil.", "That's why I've focused on putting resources into solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal.", "I believe in free trade.", "But I also believe that for far too long, certainly during the course of the Bush administration with the support of Senator McCain, the attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement.", "And NAFTA doesn't have -- did not have enforceable labor agreements and environmental agreements.", "And what I said was we should include those and make them enforceable.", "In the same way that we should enforce rules against China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper.", "And when it comes to South Korea, we've got a trade agreement up right now, they are sending hundreds of thousands of South Korean cars into the United States.", "We can only get 4,000 to 5,000 into South Korea.", "That is not free trade.", "We've got to have a president who is going to be advocating on behalf of American businesses and American workers and I make no apology for that.", "Actually, I understand it pretty well.", "The history in Colombia right now is that labor leaders have been targeted for assassination on a fairly consistent basis and there have not been prosecutions.", "But I think that the important point is we've got to have a president who understands the benefits of free trade but also is going to enforce unfair trade agreements and is going to stand up to other countries.", "When I talked about the automakers, they are obviously getting hammered right now.", "And now with the financial crisis, car dealerships are closing and people can't get car loans.", "That's why I think it's important for us to get loan guarantees to the automakers, but we do have to hold them responsible as well to start producing the highly fuel-efficient cars of the future.", " We've got to do both, and that's exactly what my plan does.", "Look, as I travel around the country, this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again.", "Just yesterday, I was in Toledo shaking some hands in a line.", "Two women, both of them probably in their mid- to late-50s, had just been laid off of their plant.", "Neither of them have health insurance.", "And they were desperate for some way of getting coverage, because, understandably, they're worried that, if they get sick, they could go bankrupt.", "If you have health insurance, then you don't have to do anything.", "If you've got health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan.", "The only thing we're going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you.", "And we estimate we can cut the average family's premium by about $2,500 per year.", "We're going to make sure that insurance companies can't discriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions.", "We'll negotiate with the drug companies for the cheapest available price on drugs.", "We are going to invest in information technology to eliminate bureaucracy and make the system more efficient.", "And we are going to make sure that we manage chronic illnesses, like diabetes and heart disease, that cost a huge amount, but could be prevented.", "We've got to put more money into preventive care.", " I just described what my plan is.", "And I'm happy to talk to you, Joe, too, if you're out there.", "Here's your fine -- zero.", "You won't pay a fine, because...", " Zero, because as I said in our last debate and I'll repeat, John, I exempt small businesses from the requirement for large businesses that can afford to provide health care to their employees, but are not doing it.", "I exempt small businesses from having to pay into a kitty.", "But large businesses that can afford it, we've got a choice.", "Either they provide health insurance to their employees or somebody has to.", "Right now, what happens is those employees get dumped into either the Medicaid system, which taxpayers pick up, or they're going to the emergency room for uncompensated care, which everybody picks up in their premiums.", "The average family is paying an additional $900 a year in higher premiums because of the uninsured.", "We exempt small businesses.", "He says he's going to give you all a $5,000 tax credit.", "That sounds pretty good.", "And you can go out and buy your own insurance.", "Here's the problem -- that for about 20 million people, you may find yourselves no longer having employer-based health insurance.", "This is because younger people might be able to get health insurance for $5,000, young and healthy folks.", "Older folks, less healthy folks, what's going to end up happening is that you're going to be the only ones left in your employer-based system, your employers won't be able to afford it.", "And once you're out on your own with this $5,000 credit, Senator McCain, for the first time, is going to be taxing the health care benefits that you have from your employer.", "For the first time in history, you will be taxing people's health care benefits.", "By the way, the average policy costs about $12,000.", "Last point about Senator McCain's plan is that insurers right now, the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and, under Senator McCain's plan, those rules would be stripped away and you would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherry-picking and excluding people from coverage.", "That, I think, is a mistake and I think that this is a fundamental difference in our campaign and how we would approach health care.", "You all just heard my plan.", "If you've got an employer-based health care plan, you keep it.", "Now, under Senator McCain's plan there is a strong risk that people would lose their employer-based health care.", "That's the choice you'll have is having your employer no longer provide you health care.", "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which generally doesn't support a lot of Democrats, said that this plan could lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system.", "All I want to do, if you've already got health care, is lower your costs.", "That includes you, Joe.", " Well, I think it's true that we shouldn't apply a strict litmus test and the most important thing in any judge is their capacity to provide fairness and justice to the American people.", "And it is true that this is going to be, I think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president.", "It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance.", "Now I would not provide a litmus test.", "But I am somebody who believes that Roe versus Wade was rightly decided.", "I think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that I think good people on both sides can disagree on.", "But what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision.", " So this is going to be an important issue.", "I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through.", "I'll just give you one quick example.", "Senator McCain and I disagreed recently when the Supreme Court made it more difficult for a woman named Lilly Ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination.", "For years, she had been getting paid less than a man had been paid for doing the exact same job.", "And when she brought a suit, saying equal pay for equal work, the judges said, well, you know, it's taken you too long to bring this lawsuit, even though she didn't know about it until fairly recently.", "We tried to overturn it in the Senate.", "I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it.", "I think that it's important for judges to understand that if a woman is out there trying to raise a family, trying to support her family, and is being treated unfairly, then the court has to stand up, if nobody else will.", "And that's the kind of judge that I want.", "There was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade.", "The fact is that there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it.", "And the Illinois Medical Society, the organization of doctors in Illinois, voted against it.", "Their Hippocratic Oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books.", "And I attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional.", "This is an issue that -- look, it divides us.", "And in some ways, it may be difficult to -- to reconcile the two views.", "But there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, \"We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby.\"", "I think it's always a tragic situation.", " We should try to reduce these circumstances.", "So we've got to get our education system right.", "In some cases, we are going to have to invest.", "Early childhood education, which closes the achievement gap, so that every child is prepared for school, every dollar we invest in that, we end up getting huge benefits with improved reading scores, reduced dropout rates, reduced delinquency rates.", "I think it's going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in math and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability.", "And I think it's important for us to make college affordable.", "Right now, I meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if they're going to college, they are taking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt, and it's very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that they're going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house.", "And that's why I've proposed a $4,000 tuition credit, every student, every year, in exchange for some form of community service, whether it's military service, whether it's Peace Corps, whether it's working in a community.", "If we do those things, then I believe that we can create a better school system.", "But there's one last ingredient that I just want to mention, and that's parents.", "We can't do it just in the schools.", "Parents are going to have to show more responsibility.", "They've got to turn off the TV set, put away the video games, and, finally, start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need.", " Well, we have a tradition of local control of the schools and that's a tradition that has served us well.", "But I do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do.", "Now we tried to do this under President Bush.", "He put forward No Child Left Behind.", "Unfortunately, they left the money behind for No Child Left Behind.", "And local school districts end up having more of a burden, a bunch of unfunded mandates, the same kind of thing that happened with special education where we did the right thing by saying every school should provide education to kids with special needs, but we never followed through on the promise of funding, and that left local school districts very cash-strapped.", "So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support.", "Senator McCain and I actually agree on two things that he just mentioned.", "Charter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions.", "I think it's important to foster competition inside the public schools.", "Where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers -- give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system.", "And I also have to disagree on Senator McCain's record when it comes to college accessibility and affordability.", "Recently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didn't seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was, well, you know, we can't give money to every interest group that comes along.", "I don't think America's youth are interest groups, I think they're our future.", "And this is an example of where we are going to have to prioritize.", "We can't say we're going to do things and then not explain in concrete terms how we're going to pay for it.", "And if we're going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it.", "It's not going to happen on its own.", "Senator McCain's absolutely right: The D.C. school system is in terrible shape, and it has been for a very long time.", "And we've got a wonderful new superintendent there who's working very hard with the young mayor there to try...", " ... who initiated -- actually, supports charters.", "That leaves all of you who live in the other 50 states without an education reform policy from Senator McCain.", "So if we are going to be serious about this issue, we've got to have a president who is going to tackle it head-on.", "And that's what I intend to do as president.", "I think we all know America is going through tough times right now.", "The policies of the last eight years and -- and Washington's unwillingness to tackle the tough problems for decades has left us in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.", "And that's why the biggest risk we could take right now is to adopt the same failed policies and the same failed politics that we've seen over the last eight years and somehow expect a different result.", "We need fundamental change in this country, and that's what I'd like to bring.", "You know, over the last 20 months, you've invited me into your homes.", "You've shared your stories with me.", "And you've confirmed once again the fundamental decency and generosity of the American people.", "And that's why I'm sure that our brighter days are still ahead.", "But we're going to have to invest in the American people again, in tax cuts for the middle class, in health care for all Americans, and college for every young person who wants to go.", "In businesses that can create the new energy economy of the future.", "In policies that will lift wages and will grow our middle class.", "These are the policies I have fought for my entire career.", "And these are the policies I want to bring to the White House.", "But it's not going to be easy.", "It's not going to be quick.", "It is going to be requiring all of us -- Democrats, Republicans, independents -- to come together and to renew a spirit of sacrifice and service and responsibility.", "I'm absolutely convinced we can do it.", "I would ask for your vote, and I promise you that if you give me the extraordinary honor of serving as your president, I will work every single day, tirelessly, on your behalf and on the behalf of the future of our children.", " I believe that the question oversimplifies the difficulties of what we must do in Central America.", "Our objectives ought to be to strengthen the democracies, to stop Communist and other extremist influences, and stabilize the community in that area.", "That's one of the big disagreements that we have with the President -- that they have not pursued the diplomatic opportunities either within El Salvador or as between the countries and have lost time during which we might have been able to achieve a peace  This brings up the whole question of what Presidential leadership is all about.", "I think the lesson in Central America, this recent embarrassment in Nicaragua where we are giving instructions for hired assassins, hiring criminals, and the rest -- all of this has strengthened our opponents.", "A President must not only assure that we're tough, but we must also be wise and smart in the exercise of that power.", "We saw the same thing in Lebanon, where we spent a good deal of America's assets.", "But because the leadership of this government did not pursue wise policies, we have been humiliated, and our opponents are stronger.", "A President is called the Commander in Chief.", "You must understand the region; you must understand the politics in the area; you must provide a strong alternative; and you must show strength -- and all at the same time.", "That's why I object to the covert action in Nicaragua.", "That's a classic example of a strategy that's embarrassed us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our people and our country in the region.", "We've seen in the Nicaraguan example a policy that has actually hurt us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our country in that region.", "I have ordered an investigation.", "I know that the CIA is already going forward with one.", "We have a gentleman down in Nicaragua who is on contract to the CIA, advising -- supposedly on military tactics -- the contras.", "And he drew up this manual.", "It was turned over to the agency head of the CIA in Nicaragua to be printed.", "And a number of pages were excised by that agency head there, the man in charge, and he sent it on up here to CIA, where more pages were excised before it was printed.", "But some way or other, there were 12 of the original copies that got out down there and were not submitted for this printing process by the CIA.", "And as soon as we have an investigation and find out where any blame lies for the few that did not get excised or changed, we certainly are going to do something about that.", "We'll take the proper action at the proper time.", "So, I can only tell you about the manual -- that we're not in the habit of assigning guilt before there has been proper evidence produced and proof of that guilt.", " I'm afraid I misspoke when I said a CIA head in Nicaragua.", "There's not someone there directing all of this activity.", "There are, as you know, CIA men stationed in other countries in the world and, certainly, in Central America.", "And so it was a man down there in that area that this was delivered to, and he recognized that what was in that manual was in direct contravention of my own Executive order, in December of 1981, that we would have nothing to do with regard to political assassinations.", "This manual -- several thousands of which were produced -- was distributed, ordering political assassinations, hiring of criminals, and other forms of terrorism.", "Some of it was excised, but the part dealing with political terrorism was continued.", "A President must know these things.", "And what about the mining of the harbors in Nicaragua which violated international law?", "I never, ever conceived of such a thing.", "I never said any such thing.", "In a discussion of our strategic arms negotiations, I said that submarines carrying missiles and airplanes carrying missiles were more conventional-type weapons, not as destabilizing as the land-based missiles, and that they were also weapons that -- or carriers -- that if they were sent out and there was a change, you could call them back before they had launched their missiles.", "How anyone could think that any sane person would believe you could call back a nuclear missile, I think is as ridiculous as the whole concept has been.", " I have said on a number of occasions exactly what I believe about the Soviet Union.", "I believe that many of the things they have done are evil in any concept of morality that we have.", "But I also recognize that as the two great superpowers in the world, we have to live with each other.", "And I told Mr. Gromyko we don't like their system.", "But between us, we can either destroy the world or we can save it.", "And I suggested that, certainly, it was to their common interest, along with ours, to avoid a conflict and to attempt to save the world and remove the nuclear weapons.", "And I think that perhaps we established a little better understanding.", "I think that in dealing with the Soviet Union one has to be realistic.", "And the result was unilateral disarmament.", "We canceled the B - 1 under the previous administration.", "What did we get for it?", "Nothing.", "The Soviet Union has been engaged in the biggest military buildup in the history of man at the same time that we tried the policy of unilateral disarmament, of weakness, if you will.", "And now we are putting up a defense of our own.", "We simply are going to provide a deterrent so that it will be too costly for them if they are nursing any ideas of aggression against us.", "There's been no change in my attitude at all.", "Our neighbors here in America are vital to us.", "We're working right now in trying to be of help in southern Africa with regard to the independence of Namibia and the removal of the Cuban surrogates, the thousands of them, from Angola.", "So, I can say there are a great many interests.", "I believe that we have a great interest in the Pacific Basin.", "That is where I think the future of the world lies.", "I don't want to send troops any place.", "I have no illusions about the Soviet Union leadership or the nature of that state.", "They are a tough and a ruthless adversary, and we must be prepared to meet that challenge, and I would.", "Where I part with the President is that despite all of those differences we must, as past Presidents before this one have done, meet on the common ground of survival.", "And that's where the President has opposed practically every arms control agreement, by every President, of both political parties, since the bomb went off.", "And he now completes this term with no progress toward arms control at all, but with a very dangerous arms race underway instead.", "There are now over 2,000 more warheads pointed at us today than there were when he was sworn in, and that does not strengthen us.", "We must be very, very realistic in the nature of that leadership, but we must grind away and talk to find ways of reducing these differences, particularly where arms races are concerned and other dangerous exercises of Soviet power.", "There will be no unilateral disarmament under my administration.", "I will keep this nation strong.", "To do that, a President must know what is essential to command and to leadership and to strength.", "And that's where the President's failure to master, in my opinion, the essential elements of arms control has cost us dearly.", "He's 3 years into this administration.", "He said he just discovered that most Soviet missiles are on land, and that's why his proposal didn't work.", "I invite the American people tomorrow -- because I will issue the statement quoting President Reagan -- he said exactly what I said he said.", " I think the essential strategy of the United States ought not accept any Soviet control over Eastern Europe.", "We ought to deal with each of these countries separately.", "We ought to pursue strategies with each of them, economic and the rest, that help them pull away from their dependence upon the Soviet Union.", "Make the Soviets pay for their irresponsibility.", "[Laughter] He was against the F - 14 fighter, he was against the M - 1 tank, he was against the B - 1 bomber, he wanted to cut the salary of all of the military, he wanted to bring home half of the American forces in Europe.", "And he has a record of weakness with regard to our national defense that is second to none.", " Indeed, he was on that side virtually throughout all his years in the Senate.", "And he opposed even President Carter, when toward the end of his term President Carter wanted to increase the defense budget.", "[Applause] I propose a budget -- I have proposed a budget which would increase our nation's strength, in real terms, by double that of the Soviet Union.", "It is true over 10 years ago I voted to delay production of the F - 14, and I'll tell you why.", "The plane wasn't flying the way it was supposed to be; it was a waste of money.", "Your definition of national strength is to throw money at the Defense Department.", "My definition of national strength is to make certain that a dollar spent buys us a dollar's worth of defense.", "There's a big difference between the two of us.", "A President must manage that budget.", "I will keep us strong, but you'll not do that unless you command that budget and make certain we get the strength that we need.", "You pay $500 for a $5 hammer, you're not buying strength.", "As a matter of fact, I believe every one of those standards is essential to the exercise of power by this country.", "And we can see that in both Lebanon and in Central America.", "In Lebanon, this President exercised American power, all right, but the management of it was such that our marines were killed, we had to leave in humiliation, the Soviet Union became stronger, terrorists became emboldened.", "Similarly, in Central America: What we're doing in Nicaragua with this covert war -- which the Congress, including many Republicans, have tried to stop -- is finally end up with a public definition of American power that hurts us, where we get associated with political assassins and the rest.", "And our enemies are strengthened from all of this.", "We need to be strong, we need to be prepared to use that strength, but we must understand that we are a democracy.", "It is only in that way that we can persevere.", " What I'm referring to there is the mutual self-defense provisions that exist in the Inter-American treaty, the so-called Rio Pact, that permits the nations, our friends in that region, to combine to take steps -- diplomatic and otherwise -- to prevent Nicaragua, when she acts irresponsibly in asserting power in other parts outside of her border, to take those steps, whatever they might be, to stop it.", "The Nicaraguans must know that it is the policy of our government that that leadership must stay behind the boundaries of their nation, not interfere in other nations.", " No, Morton, I don't agree to all of those things.", "First of all, when we and our allies -- the Italians, the French, and the United Kingdom -- went into Lebanon, we went in there at the request of what was left of the Lebanese Government to be a stabilizing force while they tried to establish a government.", "But the first -- pardon me -- the first time we went in, we went in at their request because the war was going on right in Beirut between Israel and the PLO terrorists.", "Those terrorists had been violating their northern border consistently, and Israel chased them all the way to there.", "Then we went in with the multinational force to help remove, and did remove, more than 13,000 of those terrorists from Lebanon.", "And then the Government of Lebanon asked us back in as a stabilizing force while they established a government and sought to get the foreign forces all the way out of Lebanon and that they could then take care of their own borders.", "We were there for the better part of a year.", "Our position happened to be at the airport.", "Oh, there were occasional snipings and sometimes some artillery fire, but we did not engage in conflict that was out of line with our mission.", "I will never send troops anywhere on a mission of that kind without telling them that if somebody shoots at them, they can darn well shoot back.", "We never initiated any kind of action; we defended ourselves there.", "But we were succeeding to the point that the Lebanese Government had been organized -- if you will remember, there were the meetings in Geneva in which they began to meet with the hostile factional forces and try to put together some kind of a peace plan.", "There are forces there -- and that includes Syria, in my mind -- who don't want us to succeed, who don't want that kind of a peace with a dominant Lebanon, dominant over its own territory.", "And so, the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing of the building.", "Then the multilateral force withdrew for only one reason: We withdrew because we were no longer able to carry out the mission for which we had been sent in.", "But we went in in the interest of peace and to keep Israel and Syria from getting into the sixth war between them.", "I think there's a great difference between the Government of Iran threatening our diplomatic personnel, and there is a government that you can see and can put your hand on.", "In the terrorist situation, there are terrorist factions all over.", "In a recent 30-day period, 37 terrorist acts in 20 countries have been committed.", "The most recent has been the one in Brighton.", "I have just signed legislation to add to our ability to deal, along with our allies, with this terrorist problem.", "They went to him 5 days before they were killed and said, \"Please, take them out of there.''", "He did not do so.", "The report following the explosion of the barracks disclosed that we had not taken any of the steps that we should have taken.", "Then the Embassy was blown up a few weeks ago, and once again none of the steps that should have been taken were taken.", "And we were warned 5 days before that explosives were on their way, and they weren't taken.", "The terrorists have won each time.", "The President told the terrorists he was going to retaliate.", "He didn't.", "They called their bluff.", "And the bottom line is that the United States left in humiliation, and our enemies are stronger.", "First of all, Mr. Mondale should know that the President of the United States did not order the marines into that barracks.", "That was a command decision made by the commanders on the spot and based with what they thought was best for the men there.", "But we're not going to simply kill some people to say, \"Oh, look, we got even.''", "We want to know when we retaliate that we're retaliating with those who are responsible for the terrorist acts.", "And terrorist acts are such that our own United States Capitol in Washington has been bombed twice.", "I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.", "And the whole controversy about land missiles came up because we thought that the strategic nuclear weapons, the most destabilizing are the land-based.", "You put your thumb on a button and somebody blows up 20 minutes later.", "So, we thought that it would be simpler to negotiate first with those.", "And then we made it plain, a second phase, take up the submarine-launched or the airborne missiles.", "The Soviet Union, to our surprise -- and not just mine -- made it plain when we brought this up that they placed, they thought, a greater reliance on the land-based missiles and, therefore, they wanted to take up all three.", "And I have not made it an issue, nor should it be.", "What's at issue here is the President's application of his authority to understand what a President must know to lead this nation, secure our defense, and make the decisions and the judgments that are necessary.", "We just heard the President's answer for the problems at the barracks in Lebanon, where 241 marines were killed.", "First, the Joint Chiefs of Staff went to the President, said, \"Don't put those troops there.''", "They did it.", "And then 5 days before the troops were killed, they went back to the President, through the Secretary of Defense, and said, \"Please, Mr. President, take those troops out of there because we can't defend them.''", "They didn't do it.", "After that, once again, our Embassy was exploded.", "This is the fourth time this has happened -- an identical attack, in the same region, despite warnings -- even public warnings -- from the terrorists.", "This is the first administration since the bomb went off that made no progress.", "We have an arms race underway instead.", "For 3\\1/2\\ years, this administration avoided arms control, resisted tabling arms control proposals that had any hope of agreeing, rebuked their negotiator in 1981 when he came close to an agreement, at least in principle, on medium-range weapons.", "And we have this arms race underway.", "And a recent book that just came out by perhaps the Nation's most respected author in this field, Strobe Talbott, called \"Deadly Gambits,'' concludes that this President has failed to master the essential details needed to command and lead us, both in terms of security and terms of arms control.", "But it takes more than that.", "You must be tough and smart.", "Che Guevara was a contemptible figure in civilization's history.", "I know the Cuban state as a police state, and all my life I've worked in a way that demonstrates that.", "But Jesse Jackson is an independent person.", "I don't control him.", "And, as a matter of fact, we haven't avoided arms control talks with the Soviet Union.", "Very early in my administration I proposed -- and I think something that had never been proposed by any previous administration -- I proposed a total elimination of intermediate-range missiles, where the Soviets had better than a 10 -- and still have -- better than a 10-to-1 advantage over the allies in Europe.", "When they protested that and suggested a smaller number, perhaps, I went along with that.", "The so-called negotiation that you said I walked out on was the so-called walk in the woods between one of our representatives and one of the Soviet Union, and it wasn't me that turned it down, the Soviet Union disavowed it.", "One is Strobe Talbott in his classic book, \"Deadly Gambits.''", "The other is John Neuhaus, who's one of the most distinguished arms control specialists in our country.", "Both said that this administration turned down the \"walk in the woods'' agreement first, and that would have been a perfect agreement from the standpoint of the United States in Europe and our security.", "When Mr. Nitze, a good negotiator, returned, he was rebuked, and his boss was fired.", "This is the kind of leadership that we've had in this administration on the most deadly issue of our times.", "All they've got to show for 4 years in U.S.-Soviet relations is one meeting in the last weeks of an administration, and nothing before.", "This one has not.", "I object to that part of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill which I think is very unfair and would prove to be so.", "That is the part that requires employers to determine the citizenship of an employee before they're hired.", "I'm convinced that the result of this would be that people who are Hispanic, people who have different languages or speak with an accent, would find it difficult to be employed.", "I think that's wrong.", "That is counterproductive.", "I do support the other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill that strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen other ways of dealing with undocumented workers in this difficult area and dealing with the problem of settling people who have lived here for many, many years and do not have an established status.", "I have further strongly recommended that this administration do something it has not done, and that is to strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen the officials in this government that deal with undocumented workers, and to do so in a way that's responsible and within the Constitution of the United States.", "We need an answer to this problem, but it must be an American answer that is consistent with justice and due process.", "Everyone in this room, practically, here tonight, is an immigrant.", "We came here loving this nation, serving it, and it has served all of our most bountiful dreams.", "And one of those dreams is justice.", "And we need a measure -- and I will support a measure -- that brings about those objectives but avoids that one aspect that I think is very serious.", "The second part is to maintain and improve relations with our friends to the south.", "We cannot solve this problem all on our own.", "And that's why the failure of this administration to deal in an effective and a good-faith way with Mexico, with Costa Rica, with the other nations in trying to find a peaceful settlement to the dispute in Central America has undermined our capacity to effectively deal diplomatically in this area as well.", "This bill imposes upon employers the responsibility of determining whether somebody who applies for a job is an American or not.", "And just inevitably, they're going to be reluctant to hire Hispanics or people with a different accent.", "If I were dealing with politics here, the polls show the American people want this.", " Georgie Anne, we, believe me, supported the Simpson-Mazzoli bill strongly -- and the bill that came out of the Senate.", "However, there were things added in in the House side that we felt made it less of a good bill; as a matter of fact, made it a bad bill.", "And in conference -- we stayed with them in conference all the way to where even Senator Simpson did not want the bill in the manner in which it would come out of the conference committee.", "There were a number of things in there that weakened that bill.", "But it is true our borders are out of control.", "It is also true that this has been a situation on our borders back through a number of administrations.", "I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though sometime back they may have entered illegally.", "With regard to the employer sanctions, we must have that not only to ensure that we can identify the illegal aliens, but also, while some keep protesting about what it would do to employers, there is another employer that we shouldn't be so concerned about, and these are employers down through the years who have encouraged the illegal entry into this country because they then hire these individuals and hire them at starvation wages and with none of the benefits that we think are normal and natural for workers in our country, and the individuals can't complain because of their illegal status.", "We don't think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free.", "And this was why the provisions that we had in with regard to sanctions, and so forth -- and I'm going to do everything I can, and all of us in the administration are, to join in again when Congress is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us, once again, control of our borders.", "But as long as they have an economy that leaves so many people in dire poverty and unemployment, they are going to seek that employment across our borders.", "And we work with those other countries.", "As a matter of fact, the population explosion, if you look at the actual figures, has been vastly exaggerated -- over exaggerated.", "As a matter of fact, there are some pretty scientific and solid figures about how much space there still is in the world and how many more people we can have.", "It's almost like going back to the Malthusian theory, when even then they were saying that everyone would starve with the limited population they had then.", "But the problem of population growth is one, here, with regard to our immigration.", "And we have been the safety valve, whether we wanted to or not, with the illegal entry here, in Mexico, where their population is increasing and they don't have an economy that can absorb them and provide the jobs.", "And this is what we're trying to work out, not only to protect our own borders but to have some kind of fairness and recognition of that problem.", " One of the biggest problems today is that the countries to our south are so desperately poor that these people who will almost lose their lives if they don't come north, come north despite all the risks.", "And if we're going to find a permanent, fundamental answer to this, it goes to American economic and trade policies that permit these nations to have a chance to get on their own two feet and to get prosperity, so that they can have jobs for themselves and their people.", "And that's why this enormous national debt, engineered by this administration, is harming these countries in fueling this immigration.", "These high interest rates -- real rates that have doubled under this administration -- have had the same effect on Mexico and so on, and the cost of repaying those debts is so enormous that it results in massive unemployment, hardship, and heartache.", "And that drives our friends to the south up into our region, and we need to end those deficits as well.", "But with regard to these high interest rates, too, at least give us the recognition of the fact that when you left office, Mr. Mondale, they were 21\\1/2\\ -- the prime rate.", "So, we're trying to undo some of the things that your administration did.", " Mr. Kalb, I think what has been hailed as something I'm supposedly, as President, discussing as principle is the recall of just some philosophical discussions with people who are interested in the same things; and that is the prophecies down through the years, the biblical prophecies of what would portend the coming of Armageddon, and so forth, and the fact that a number of theologians for the last decade or more have believed that this was true, that the prophecies are coming together that portend that.", "But no one knows whether Armageddon, those prophecies mean that Armageddon is a thousand years away or day after tomorrow.", "So, I have never seriously warned and said we must plan according to Armageddon.", "And that is why we are maintaining a deterrent and trying to achieve a deterrent capacity to where no one would believe that they could start such a war and escape with limited damage.", "But the deterrent -- and that's what it is for -- is also what led me to propose what is now being called the Star Wars concept, but propose that we research to see if there isn't a defensive weapon that could defend against incoming missiles.", "There has never been a weapon invented in the history of man that has not led to a defensive, a counterweapon.", "But why not do what I have offered to do and asked the Soviet Union to do?", "Say, \"Look, here's what we can do.", "We'll even give it to you.", "Now, will you sit down with us and once and for all get rid, all of us, of these nuclear weapons and free mankind from that threat?''", "I think that would be the greatest use of a defensive weapon.", " First of all, let me sharply disagree with the President on sharing the most advanced, the most dangerous, the most important technology in America with the Soviet Union.", "We have had for many years, understandably, a system of restraints on high technology because the Soviets are behind us.", "And any research or development along the Star Wars schemes would inevitably involve our most advanced computers, our most advanced engineering.", "I would not let the Soviet Union get their hands on it at all.", "There's nothing wrong with the theory of it.", "If we could develop a principle that would say both sides could fire all their missiles and no one would get hurt, I suppose it's a good idea.", "But the fact of it is we're so far away from research that even comes close to that, that the Director of Engineering Research at the Defense Department said to get there we would have to solve eight problems, each of which are more difficult than the atomic bomb and the Manhattan project.", "It would cost something like a trillion dollars to test and deploy weapons.", "The second thing is this all assumes that the Soviets wouldn't respond in kind.", "And they always do.", "We don't get behind.", "They won't get behind.", "We have more at stake in space satellites than they do.", "If we could stop, right now, the testing and the deployment of these space weapons -- and the President's proposals go clear beyond research; if it was just research we wouldn't have any argument, because maybe someday, somebody will think of something -- but to commit this nation to a buildup of antisatellite and space weapons at this time, in their crude state, would bring about an arms race that's very dangerous indeed.", "The most dangerous aspect of this proposal is, for the first time, we would delegate to computers the decision as to whether to start a war.", "That's dead wrong.", "There wouldn't be time for a President to decide; it would be decided by these remote computers.", "It might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer might decide it's a missile -- and off we go.", " Every system that is verifiable should be placed on the table for negotiations for an agreement.", "I would not agree to any negotiations or any agreement that involved conduct on the part of the Soviet Union that we couldn't verify every day.", "I would not agree to any agreement in which the United States security interest was not fully recognized and supported.", "Because this ever-rising arms race madness makes both nations less secure.", "It's more difficult to defend this nation.", "It's putting a hair-trigger on nuclear war.", "This administration, by going into the Star Wars system, is going to add a dangerous new escalation.", " -- -- and the people of the Soviet Union want it to stop.", " Yes, my rebuttal, once again, is that this invention that has just been created here of how I would go about rolling over for the Soviet Union -- no, Mr. Mondale, my idea would be with that defensive weapon that we would sit down with them and then say, \"Now, are you willing to join us?", "Here's what we'' -- give them a demonstration and then say -- \"Here's what we can do.", "Now, if you're willing to join us in getting rid of all the nuclear weapons in the world, then we'll give you this one, so that we would both know that no one can cheat; that we're both got something that if anyone tries to cheat .", ".''", "I said, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed with me, that it was time for us to turn our research ability to seeing if we could not find this kind of defensive weapon.", "And suddenly somebody says, \"Oh, it's got to be up there, and it's Star Wars,'' and so forth.", "I don't know what it would be, but if we can come up with one, I think the world will be better off.", " Well, that's what a President's supposed to know -- where those weapons are going to be.", "Now, this is the most dangerous technology that we possess.", "The Soviets try to spy on us, steal this stuff.", "And to give them technology of this kind, I disagree with.", "You haven't just accepted research, Mr. President.", "You've set up a Strategic Defense Initiative, an agency, you're beginning to test, you're talking about deploying, you're asking for a budget of some $30 billion for this purpose.", "This is an arms escalation.", "If someday, somebody comes along with an answer, that's something else.", "But that there would be an answer in our lifetime is unimaginable.", "That's what a President's for.", "As a matter of fact, we have a vast range of technology and weaponry right now that provides all the bargaining chips that we need.", "And I support the air launch cruise missile, the ground launch cruise missile, the Pershing missile, the Trident submarine, the D - 5 submarine, Stealth technology, the Midgetman -- we have a whole range of technology.", "It'll draw an attack.", "It puts a hair-trigger, and it is a dangerous, destabilizing weapon.", "The Secretary of Defense himself said it would be a suicide mission if it were built.", "This makes us stronger.", "The final point is that we can use this money that we save on these weapons to spend on things that we really need.", "Our conventional strength in Europe is under strength.", "It's in this way, by making wise choices, that we're stronger, we enhance the chances of arms control.", " I will not agree to any arms control agreement, including a freeze, that's not verifiable.", "The warhead principle -- there have been counting rules for years.", "Whenever a weapon is tested we count the number of warheads on it, and whenever that warhead is used we count that number of warheads, whether they have that number or less on it, or not.", "I will not agree to any production restrictions -- or agreements, unless we have the ability to verify those agreements.", "I don't trust the Russians.", "I believe that every agreement we reach must be verifiable, and I will not agree to anything that we cannot tell every day.", "In other words, we've got to be tough.",

some time, and I did think that it was a blot on our record that we let him down.", "The Shah, whatever he might have done, was building low-cost housing, had taken land away from the Mullahs and was distributing it to the peasants so they could be landowners -- things of that kind.", "But we turned it over to a maniacal fanatic who has slaughtered thousands and thousands of people, calling it executions.", "And, as a matter of fact, the previous administration stood by and so did I -- not that I could have done anything in my position at that time -- but for this revolution to take place.", "And the promise of the revolution was democracy, human rights, free labor unions, free press.", "And then, just as Castro had done in Cuba, the Sandinistas ousted the other parties to the revolution.", "Many of them are now the contras.", "They exiled some, they jailed some, they murdered some.", "And they installed a Marxist-Leninist totalitarian government.", "And what I have to say about this is, many times -- and this has to do with the Philippines, also, I know there are things there in the Philippines that do not look good to us from the standpoint right now of democratic rights, but what is the alternative?", "It is a large Communist movement to take over the Philippines.", "They have been our friend since their inception as a nation.", "And I think that we've had enough of a record of letting -- under the guise of revolution -- someone that we thought was a little more right than we would be, letting that person go, and then winding up with totalitarianism, pure and simple, as the alternative.", "And I think that we're better off, for example with the Philippines, of trying to retain our friendship and help them right the wrongs we see, rather than throwing them to the wolves and then facing a Communist power in the Pacific.", " Well, as I say, we have to look at what an overthrow there would mean and what the government would be that would follow.", "And there is every evidence, every indication that that government would be hostile to the United States.", "And that would be a severe blow to our abilities there in the Pacific.", " Perhaps in no area do we disagree more than this administration's policies on human rights.", "I went to the Philippines as Vice President, pressed for human rights, called for the release of Aquino, and made progress that had been stalled on both the Subic and the Clark airfield bases.", "Fortunately, a democracy took over, but this nation was embarrassed by this current administration's adoption of their policies.", "What happens in South Africa, where, for example, the Nobel Prize winner, 2 days ago, said this administration is seen as working with the oppressive government of South Africa.", "That hurts this nation.", "We need to stand for human rights.", "We need to make it clear we're for human liberty.", "National security and human rights must go together.", "But this administration time and time again has lost its way in this field.", " Well, the invasion of Afghanistan didn't take place on our watch.", "I have described what has happened in Iran, and we weren't here then either.", "I don't think that our record of human rights can be assailed.", "I think that we have observed, ourselves, and have done our best to see that human rights are extended throughout the world.", "Mr. Mondale has recently announced a plan of his to get the democracies together and to work with the whole world to turn to democracy.", "Human rights are not advanced when, at the same time, you then stand back and say, \"Whoops, we didn't know the gun was loaded,'' and you have another totalitarian power on your hands.", " Well, I can't say that I have roundtabled that and sat down with the Chiefs of Staff, but I have said that it seems to me that this could be a logical step in what is my ultimate goal, my ultimate dream, and that is the elimination of nuclear weapons in the world.", "And it seems to me that this could be an adjunct, or certainly a great assisting agent in getting that done.", "I am not going to roll over, as Mr. Mondale suggests, and give them something that could turn around and be used against us.", "But I think it's a very interesting proposal, to see if we can find, first of all, something that renders those weapons obsolete, incapable of their mission.", "But Mr. Mondale seems to approve MAD -- MAD is mutual assured destruction -- meaning, if you use nuclear weapons on us, the only thing we have to keep you from doing it is that we'll kill as many people of yours as you'll kill of ours.", "I think that to do everything we can to find, as I say, something that would destroy weapons and not humans is a great step forward in human rights.", " I believe in a sensible arms control approach that brings down these weapons to manageable levels.", "And in the meantime, we have to be strong enough to make certain that the Soviet Union never tempts us.", "Now, here we have to decide between generalized objectives and reality.", "The President says he wants to eliminate or reduce the number of nuclear weapons.", "But, in fact, these last 4 years have seen more weapons built, a wider and more vigorous arms race than in human history.", "A President, to defend this country and to get arms control, must master what's going on.", "But the hard reality is that we must know what we're doing and pursue those objectives that are possible in our time.", "He's opposed every effort of every President to do so, and in the 4 years of his administration he's failed to do so.", "I believe we need to be strong, and I will keep us strong.", "But I think strength must also require wisdom and smarts in its exercise.", "That's key to the strength of our nation.", "A President must know the essential facts essential to command.", "But a President must also have a vision of where this nation should go.", "As President, I would press for long-term, vigorous economic growth.", "That's why I want to get these debts down and these interest rates down, restore America's exports, help rural America, which is suffering so much, and bring the jobs back here for our children.", "I want this next generation to be the best educated in American history, to invest in the human mind and science again, so we're out front.", "I want this

all, I want a nation that's strong.", "Since we debated 2 weeks ago, the United States and the Soviet Union have built a hundred more warheads, enough to kill millions of Americans and millions of Soviet citizens.", "This doesn't strengthen us.", "This weakens the chances of civilization to survive.", "I remember the night before I became Vice President.", "I was given the briefing and told that any time, night or day, I might be called upon to make the most fateful decision on Earth -- whether to fire these atomic weapons that could destroy the human species.", "A President must know right then.", "But above all, pick a President who will fight to avoid the day when that God-awful decision ever needs to be made.", "We are the strongest and most powerful free society on Earth.",

must be.", "I believe that this president, regrettably, rushed us into a war, made decisions about foreign policy, pushed alliances away.", "And, as a result, America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be.", "Firehouses don't have enough firefighters in them.", "So we can do a better job of homeland security.", "I can do a better job of waging a

safe.", "My opponent just this weekend talked about how terrorism could be reduced to a nuisance, comparing it to prostitution, illegal gambling.", "I think that attitude and that point of view is

can't pass any test under his vision of the world.", "I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be able to own a gun.", "I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don't get in the hands of people that shouldn't have them.", "But the best way to protect our citizens from guns is to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns.", "And that's why early in my administration I called the attorney general and the U. S. attorneys and said: Put together a task force all around the country to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns.", "Neighborhoods are safer when we crack down on people who commit crimes with guns.", "To me, that's the best way to secure America.", " I believe it was a failure of presidential leadership not to reauthorize the assault weapons ban.", "I'm also a former law enforcement officer.", "I ran one of the largest district attorney's offices in America, one of the ten largest.", "I put people behind bars for the rest of their life.", "I've broken up organized crime.", "I know something about prosecuting.", "And most of the law enforcement agencies in America wanted that assault weapons ban.", "They don't want to go into a drug bust and be facing an AK-47.", "Because of the president's decision today, law enforcement officers will walk into a place that will be more dangerous.", "Terrorists can now come into America and go to a gun show and, without even a background check, buy an assault weapon today.", "It encouraged them to do it.", "So I believe America's less safe.", "And I regret to say that this administration has even blocked steps that could help us move further along.", "I served on the Small Business Committee for a long time.", "Now I'm the senior Democrat on it.", "We used to -- you know, we have a goal there for minority set-aside programs, to try to encourage ownership in the country.", "They don't reach those goals.", "They don't even fight to reach those goals.", "They've tried to undo them.", "The fact is that in too many parts of our country, we still have discrimination.", "And affirmative action is not just something that applies to people of color.", "I think that we have a long way to go, regrettably.", "If you look at what's happened -- we've made progress, I want to say that at the same time.", "During the Clinton years, as you may recall, there was a fight over affirmative action.", "And there were many people, like myself, who opposed quotas, who felt there were places where it was overreaching.", "And we fixed it for a reason: because there are too many people still in this country who feel the stark resistance of racism, and so we have a distance to travel.", "As president, I will make certain we travel it.", "This president is the first president ever, I think, not to meet with the NAACP.", "This is a president who hasn't met with the Black Congressional Caucus.", "This is a president who has not met with the civil rights leadership of our country.", "If a president doesn't reach out and bring people in and be inclusive, then how are we going to get over those barriers?", " Well, first of all, it is just not true that I haven't met with the Black Congressional Caucus.",

Grants by a million students.", "Do you realize today in America, we spend $73 billion to help 10 million low- and middle-income families better afford college?", "That's the access I believe is

diploma.", "I believe part of a hopeful society is one in which somebody owns something.", "Today in America more minorities own a home than ever before.", "And that's hopeful, and that's positive.",

Almighty.", "Everything is a gift from the Almighty.", "And as I measure the words of the Bible -- and we all do; different people measure different things -- the Koran, the Torah, or, you know,

country and on this planet.", "We have a separate and unequal school system in the United States of America.", "There's one for the people who have, and there's one for the people who don't have.", "I talked about it earlier when I talked about the works and faith without works being dead.", "I think we've got a lot more work to do.", "I think in those days after 9/11, I thought the president did a terrific job.", "And I really was moved, as well as impressed, by the speech that he gave to the Congress.", "And I think the hug Tom Daschle gave him at that moment was about as genuine a sense of there being no Democrats, no Republicans, we were all just Americans.", "I regret to say that the president who called himself a uniter, not a divider, is now presiding over the most divided America in the recent memory of our country.", "I've never seen such ideological squabbles in the Congress of the United States.", "I've never seen members of a party locked out of meetings the way they're

America.", " My biggest disappointment in Washington is how partisan the town is.", "I had a record of working with Republicans and Democrats as the governor of Texas, and I was hopeful I'd be able to do the same thing.", "The No Child Left Behind Act, incredibly enough, was good work between me and my administration and people like Senator Ted Kennedy.", "And we worked together with Democrats to relieve the tax burden on the middle class and all who pay taxes in order to make sure this economy continues to grow.", "And the way I view it is there's a lot of entrenched special interests there, people who are, you know, on one side of the issue or another and they spend enormous sums of money and they convince different senators to taut their way or different congressmen to talk about their issue, and they dig in.", "I'll continue, in the four years, to continue to try to work to do so.", "And my opponent has got a plan of retreat and defeat in Iraq.", " To listen to them.", "(LAUGHTER)

Bush.", "And not only did she interest me, I guess you would say it was love at first sight.", " Well, I guess the president and you and I are three examples of lucky people who married up.", "And my

have health care for all Americans.", "We can further the cause of equality in our nation.", "Let me just make it clear: I will never allow any country to have a veto over our security.", "Just as I fought for our country as a young man, with the same passion I will fight to defend this nation that I love.", "I believe we can do better.", "I think the greatest possibilities of our country, our dreams and our hopes, are out there just waiting for us to grab onto them.", "I ask you to allow me the privilege of leading this great nation of ours, of helping us to be stronger here at home and to

privilege.", "I have traveled to forty-eight of the fifty states and in my travels I have learned what the people of the United States are thinking about.", "There is one issue that stands out above all the rest, one in which every American is concerned, regardless of what group he may be a member and regardless of where he may live.", "And that issue, very simply stated, is this: how can we keep the peace - keep it without surrender?", "How can we extend freedom - extend it without war?", "Now in determining how we deal with this issue, we must find the answer to a very important but simple question: who threatens the peace?", "Who threatens freedom in the world?", "There is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom - that that is presented by the international Communist movement.", "And therefore if we are to have peace, we must know how to deal with the Communists and their leaders.", "I know Mr. Khrushchev.", "I also have had the opportunity of knowing and meeting other Communist leaders in the world.", "I believe there are certain principles we must find in dealing with him and his colleagues - principles, if followed, that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom.", "In the seven years before this Administration came into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain.", "And at the end of that seven years we were engaged in a war in Korea which cost of thirty thousand American lives.", "In the past seven years, in President Eisenhower's Administration, this situation has been reversed.", "We ended the Korean War; by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars; and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table.", "I think there're several reasons.", "One of the major errors they made was the one that led to the Korean War.", "In ruling out the defense of Korea, they invited aggression in that area.", "They thought they were going to have peace - it brought war.", "We learned from their mistakes.", "And so, in our seven years, we find that we have been firm in our diplomacy; we have never made concessions without getting concessions in return.", "We have always been willing to go the extra mile to negotiate for disarmament or in any other area.", "But we have never been willing to do anything that, in effect, surrendered freedom any place in the world.", "That is why President Eisenhower was correct in not apologizing or expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev at the Paris Conference, as Senator Kennedy suggested he could have done.", "It encourages them to begin a war.", "And so I say that the record shows that we know how to keep the peace, to keep it without surrender.", "That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area.", "First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have - if the should launch a surprise attack - we will be able to destroy their war-making capability.", "They must know, in other words, that it is national suicide if they begin anything.", "In addition to military strength, we need to see that the economy of this country continues to grow.", "It has grown in the past seven years.", "It can and will grow even more in the next four.", "And the reason that it must grow even more is because we have things to do at home and also because we're in a race for survival - a race in which it isn't enough to be ahead; it isn't enough simply to be complacent.", "We have to move ahead in order to stay ahead.", "And that is why, in this field, I have made recommendations which I am confident will move the American economy ahead - move it firmly and soundly so that there will never be a time when the Soviet Union will be able to challenge our superiority in this field.", "And so we need military strength, we need economic strength, we also need the right diplomatic policies.", "Again we turn to the past.", "Firmness but no belligerence, and by no belligerence I mean that we do not answer insult by insult.", "When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues.", "And that example that President Eisenhower has set we will continue to follow.", "But all this by itself is not enough.", "It is not enough for us simply to be the strongest nation militarily, the strongest economically, and also to have firm diplomacy.", "We must have a great goal.", "And you cannot fight a victory for Communism or a strategy of victory for Communism with the strategy, simply of holding the line.", "And so I say that we believe that our policies of military strength, of economic strength, of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep it without surrender.", "We also believe that in the great field of ideals that we can lead America to the victory for freedom - victory in the newly developing countries, victory also in the captive countries - provided we have faith in ourselves and faith in our principles.", "I voted for the Formosa resolution in 1955.", "I have sustained it since then.", "I've said that I agree with the Administration policy.", "Mr. Nixon earlier indicated that he would defend Quemoy and Matsu even if the attack on these islands, two miles off the coast of China, were not part of a general attack an Formosa and the Pescadores.", "I indicated that I would defend those islands if the attack were directed against Pescadores and Formosa, which is part of the Eisenhower policy.", "I've supported that policy.", "In the last week, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have re-read the testimony of General Twining representing the Administration in 1959, and the Assistant Secretary of State before the Foreign Relations Committee in 1958, and I have accurately described the Administration policy, and I support it wholeheartedly.", "So that really isn't an issue in this campaign.", "It isn't an issue with Mr. Nixon, who now says that he also supports the Eisenhower policy.", "I don't believe it is.", "I don't believe that our relative strength is increasing.", "And I say that not as the Democratic standard-bearer, but as a citizen of the United States who is concerned about the United States.", "I look at Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States.", "In 1957 I was in Havana.", "I talked to the American Ambassador there.", "He said that he was the second most powerful man in Cuba.", "And yet even though Ambassador Smith and Ambassador Gardner, both Republican Ambassadors, both warned of Castro, the Marxist influences around Castro, the Communist influences around Castro, both of them have testified in the last six weeks, that in spite of their warnings to the American government, nothing was done.", "Our d- security depends upon Latin America.", "At the American Conference - Inter-American Conference this summer, when we wanted them to join together in the denunciation of Castro and the Cuban Communists, we couldn't even get the Inter-American group to join together in denouncing Castro.", "It was rather a vague statement that they finally made.", "Do you know today that the Com- the Russians broadcast ten times as many programs in Spanish to Latin America as we do?", "Do you know we don't have a single program sponsored by our government to Cuba - to tell them our story, to tell them that we are their friends, that we want them to be free again?", "Africa is now the emerging area of the world.", "It contains twenty-five percent of all the members of the General Assembly.", "We didn't even have a Bureau of African Affairs until 1957.", "In the Africa south of the Sahara, which is the major new section, we have less students from all of Africa in that area studying under government auspices today than from the country of Thailand.", "If there's one thing Africa needs it's technical assistance.", "And yet last year we gave them less than five percent of all the technical assistance funds that we distributed around the world.", "We relied in the Middle East on the Baghdad Pact, and yet when the Iraqi Government was changed, the Baghdad Pact broke down.", "We relied on the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Middle East, which passed the Senate.", "There isn't one country in the Middle East that now endorses the Eisenhower Doctrine.", "I don't think they do, enough.", "On the question of admission of Red China, only two countries in all of Africa voted with us - Liberia and the Union of South Africa.", "The rest either abstained or voted against us.", "More countries in Asia voted against us on that question than voted with us.", "I believe that this struggle is going to go on, and it may be well decided in the next decade.", "I have seen Cuba go to the Communists.", "I have seen Communist influence and Castro influence rise in Latin America.", "I have seen us ignore Africa.", "There are six countries in Africa that are members of the United Nations.", "There isn't a single American diplomatic representative in any of those six.", "When Guinea became independent, the Soviet Ambassador showed up that very day.", "We didn't recognize them for two months; the American Ambassador didn't show up for nearly eight months.", "I believe that the world is changing fast.", "And I don't think this Administration has shown the foresight, has shown the knowledge, has been identified with the great fight which these people are waging to be free, to get a better standard of living, to live better.", "The average income in some of those countries is twenty-five dollars a year.", "The Communists say, \"Come with us; look what we've done.\"", "And we've been in - on the whole, uninterested.", "I think we're going to have to do better.", "Mr. Nixon talks about our being the strongest country in the world.", "I think we are today.", "But we were far stronger relative to the Communists five years ago, and what is of great concern is that the balance of power is in danger of moving with them.", "I'm not as confident as he is that we will be the strongest military power by 1963.", "He talks about economic growth as a great indicator of freedom.", "I agree with him.", "What we do in this country, the kind of society that we build, that will tell whether freedom will be sustained around the world.", "And yet, in the last nine months of this year, we've had a drop in our economic growth rather than a gain.", "We've had the lowest rate of increase of economic growth in the last nine months of any major industrialized society in the world.", "I look up and see the Soviet flag on the moon.", "The fact is that the State Department polls on our prestige and influence around the world have shown such a sharp drop that up till now the State Department has been unwilling to release them.", "And yet they were polled by the U.S.I.A.", "The point of all this is, this is a struggle in which we're engaged.", "We want peace.", "We want freedom.", "We want security.", "We want to be stronger.", "We want freedom to gain.", "But I don't believe in these changing and revolutionary times this Administration has known that the world is changing - has identified itself with that change.", "I think the Communists have been moving with vigor - Laos, Africa, Cuba - all around the world today they're on the move.", "I think we have to revita1ize our society.", "I think we have to demonstrate to the people of the world that we're determined in this free country of ours to be first - not first if, and not first but, and not first when - but first.", "And when we are strong and when we are first, then freedom gains; then the prospects for peace increase; then the prospects for our society gain.", "I think that Senator Kennedy's policies and recommendations for the handling of the Castro regime are probably the most dangers- dangerously irresponsible recommendations that he's made during the course of this campaign.", "In effect, what Senator Kennedy recommends is that the United States government should give help to the exiles and to those within Cuba who oppose the Castro regime - provided they are anti-Batista.", "Now let's just see what this means.", "We have five treaties with Latin America, including the one setting up the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948, in which we have agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of any other American country - and they as well have agreed to do likewise.", "The charter of the United Nations - its Preamble, Article I and Article II - also provide that there shall be no intervention by one nation in the internal affairs of another.", " that if we were to follow that recommendation, that we would lose all of our friends in Latin America, we would probably be condemned in the United Nations, and we would not accomplish our objective.", "It would be an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to come in, to come into Latin America and to engage us in what would be a civil war, and possibly even worse than that.", "This is the major recommendation that he's made.", "Well, we can do what we did with Guatemala.", "There was a Communist dictator that we inherited from the previous Administration.", "We quarantined Mr. Arbenz.", "The result was that the Guatemalan people themselves eventually rose up and they threw him out.", "We are quarantining Mr. Castro today.", "We are cutting off the significant items that the Cuban regime needs in order to survive.", "By cutting off trade, by cutting off our diplomatic relations as we have, we will quarantine this regime so that the people of Cuba themselves will take care of Mr. Castro.", "But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want.", " Mr. Nixon uh - shows himself i- misinformed.", "He surely must be aware that most of the equipment and arms and resources for Castro came from the United States, flowed out of Florida and other parts of the United States to Castro in the mountains.", "There isn't any doubt about that, number one.", "Number two, I believe that if any economic sanctions against Latin America are going to be successful they have to be multilateral.", "They have to include the other countries of Latin America.", "The very minute effect of the action which has been taken this week on Cuba's economy - I believe Castro can replace those markets very easily through Latin America, through Europe, and through Eastern Europe.", "If the United States had stronger prestige and influence in Latin America it could persuade - as Franklin Roosevelt did in 1940 - the countries of Latin America to join in an economic quarantine of Castro.", "Number three, Castro is only the beginning of our difficulties throughout Latin America.", "The big struggle will be to prevent the influence of Castro spreading to other countries - Mexico, Panama, Bolivia, Colombia.", "We're going to have to try to provide closer ties, to associate ourselves with the great desire of these people for a better life if we're going to prevent Castro's influence from spreading throughout all of Latin America.", "His influence is strong enough today to prevent us from joi- getting the other countries of Latin America to join with us in economic quarantine.", "You yourself said, Mr. Vice President, a month ago, that if we had provided the kind of economic aid five years ago that we are now providing we might never have had Castro.", " Mr. Edwards, I don't think it's a wise idea for presidential candidates to appoint the members of his cabinet prospectively, or to suggest four people - indicate that one of them surely will be appointed.", "This is a decision that the president of the United States must make.", "The last candidate who indicated that he knew who his cabinet was going to be was Mr. Dewey in 1948.", "This is a race between the Vice President and myself for the presidency of the United States.", "There are a good many able men who could be secretary of state.", "I've made no judgment about who should be secretary of state.", "I think that judgment could be made after election, if I'm successful.", "The people have to make a choice between Mr. Nixon and myself, between the Republican party and the Democratic party, between our approach to the problems which now disturb us as a nation and disturb us as a world power.", "The president bears the constitutional responsibility, not the secretary of state, for the conduct of foreign affairs.", "Some presidents have been strong in foreign policy; others have relied heavily on the secretary of state.", "I've been a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; I run for the presidency with full knowledge that his great responsibility, really, given to him by the Constitution and by the force of events, is in the field of foreign affairs.", "I'm asking the people's support as president.", "We will select the best man we can get.", "But I've not made a judgment, and I have not narrowed down a list of three or four people, among whom would be the candidate.", " Well Mr. Edwards, as you probably know, I have consistently answered all questions with regard to who will be in the next cabinet by saying that that is the responsibility of the next president, and it would be inappropriate to make any decisions on that or to announce any prior to the time that I had the right to do so.", "I would like to point out that when we look at our programs in Latin America, we find that we have appropriated five times as much for Latin America as was appropriated by the previous Administration; we find that we have two billion dollars more for the Export-Import Bank; we have a new bank for Latin America alone of a billion dollars; we have the new program which was submitted at the Bogota Conference - this new program that President Eisenhower submitted, approved by the last Congress - for five hundred million dollars.", "We have moved in Latin America very effectively, and I'd also like to point this out: Senator Kennedy complains very appropriately about our inadequate ra- radio broadcasts for Latin America.", "Let me point out again that his Congress - the Democratic Congress - has cut eighty million dollars off of the Voice of America appropriations.", "Now, he has to get a better job out of his Congress if he's going to get us the money that we need to conduct the foreign affairs of this country in Latin America or any place else.", "First of all, the report to which Senator Kennedy refers is one that was made many, many months ago and related particularly to the uh - period immediately after Sputnik.", "Second, as far as this report is concerned, I would have no objection to having it made public.", "Third, I would say this with regard to this report, with regard to Gallup Polls of prestige abroad and everything else that we've been hearing about \"what about American prestige abroad\": America's prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for America allow it to be.", "Well, it can only have the effect certainly of reducing it.", "Senator Kennedy has a responsibility to criticize those things that are wrong, but he has also a responsibility to be right in his criticism.", "Every one of these items that I have mentioned he's been wrong - dead wrong.", "And for that reason he has contributed to any lack of prestige.", "Finally, let me say this: as far as prestige is concerned, the first place it would show up would be in the United Nations.", "Now Senator Kennedy has referred to the vote on Communist China.", "Let's look at the vote on Hungary.", "There we got more votes for condemning Hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year.", "Let's look at the reaction eh - reaction to Khrushchev and Eisenhower at the last U.N. session.", "Did Khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted?", "Not at all.", "The President gained.", "America gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it's that that keeps the prestige of America up, not running down America the way Senator Kennedy has been running her down.", " I really don't need uh - Mr. Nixon to tell me about what my responsibilities are as a citizen.", "I've served this country for fourteen years in the Congress and before that in the service.", "I've just as high a devotion, just as high an opinion.", "What I downgrade, Mr. Nixon, is the leadership the country is getting, not the country.", "Now I didn't make most of the statements that you said I made.", "The s- I believe the Soviet Union is first in outer space.", "We have - may have made more shots but the size of their rocket thrust and all the rest - you yourself said to Khrushchev, \"You may be ahead of us in rocket thrust but we're ahead of you in color television\" in your famous discussion in the kitchen.", "I think that color television is not as important as rocket thrust.", "Secondly, I didn't say we had the worst slums in the world.", "I said we had too many slums.", "And that they are bad, and we ought to do something about them, and we ought to support housing legislation which this Administration has opposed.", "I didn't say we had the worst education in the world.", "What I said was that ten years ago, we were producing twice as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union and today they're producing twice as many as we are, and that this affects our security around the world.", "And fourth, I believe that the polls and other studies and votes in the United Nations and anyone reading the paper and any citizen of the United States must come to the conclusion that the United States no longer carries the same image of a vital society on the move with its brightest days ahead as it carried a decade or two decades ago.", "Part of that is because we've stood still here at home, because we haven't met our problems in the United States, because we haven't had a moving economy.", "We're first in other areas of science but in space, which is the new science, we're not first.", " Yes, I think the next president of the United States should make one last effort to secure an agreement on the cessation of tests, number one.", "I think we should go back to Geneva, who's ever elected president, Mr. Nixon or myself, and try once again.", "If we fail then, if we're unable to come to an agreement - and I hope we can come to an agreement because it does not merely involve now the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as atomic powers.", "Because new breakthroughs in atomic energy technology there's some indications that by the time the next president's term of office has come to an end, there may be ten, fifteen, or twenty countries with an atomic capacity, perhaps that many testing bombs with all the effect that it could have on the atmosphere and with all the chances that more and more countries will have an atomic capacity, with more and more chance of war.", "So one more effort should be made.", "I don't think that even if that effort fails that it will be necessary to carry on tests in the atmosphere which pollute the atmosphere.", "They can be carried out underground, they c- could be carried on in outer space.", "But I believe the effort should be made once more by who's ever elected president of the United States.", "If we fail, it's been a great serious failure for everyone - for the human race.", "But then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then we'll have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the United States, and there may have to be testing underground.", "I think the Atomic Energy Committee is prepared for it.", "There may be testing in outer space.", "I hope it will not be necessary for any power to resume uh - testing in the atmosphere.", "It's possible to detect those kind of tests.", "The kind of tests which you can't detect are underground or in - in uh - perhaps in outer space.", "So that I'm hopeful we can try once more.", "If we fail then we must meet our responsibilities to ourselves.", "But I'm most concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapons.", "China may have it by 1963, Egypt.", "War has been the constant companion of mankind, so to have these weapons disseminated around the world, I believe means that we're going to move through a period of hazard in the next few years.", "We ought to make one last effort.", "I would say first of all that we must have in mind the fact that we have been negotiating to get tests inspected and uh - to get an agreement for many, many months.", "As a matter of fact, there's been a moratorium on testing as a result of the fact that we have been negotiating.", "I don't think we can wait until the next president is inaugurated and then uh - select a new team and then all the months of negotiating that will take place before we reach a decision, I think that immediately after this election we should set a timetable - the next president, working with the present President, President Eisenhower - a timetable to break the Soviet filibuster.", "There should be no tests in the atmosphere; that rules out any fall-out.", "I think it's time for them to fish or cut bait.", "I think that the next president immediately after his election should sit down with the President, work out a timetable, and - get a decision on this before January of next year.", " Well the conditions I laid out in one of our previous television debates, and it's rather difficult to be much more specific than that.", "Uh - First of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference.", "This means at the secretary of state level and at the ambassadorial level.", "By adequate preparation I mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda, an agenda agreed upon with the approval of the heads of state involved.", "Now this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation.", "I don't believe we should go to a summit conference unless we have such an agenda, unless we have some reasonable insur- assurance from Mr. Khrushchev that he intends seriously to negotiate on those points.", "Now this may seem like a rigid, inflexible position.", "But let's look at the other side of the coin.", "If we build up the hopes of the world by having a summit conference that is not adequately prepared, and then, if Mr. Khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up - as he did this one - because he isn't going to get his way - we'd set back the cause of peace.", "We do not help it.", "We can, in other words, negotiate many of these items of difference between us without going to the summit.", "I think we have to make a greater effort than we have been making at the secretary of state level, at the ambassadorial level, to work out the differences that we have.", "And so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit - a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it is.", " Well, I think the president of the United States last winter indicated that before he'd go to the summit in May he did last fall, he indicated that there should be some agenda, that there should be some prior agreement.", "He hoped that there would be uh - b- be an agreement in part in disarmament.", "He also expressed the hope that there should be some understanding of the general situation in Berlin.", "The Soviet Union refused to agree to that, and we went to the summit and it was disastrous.", "I believe we should not go to the summit until there is some reason to believe that a meeting of minds can be obtained on either Berlin, outer space, or general disarmament - including nuclear testing.", "In addition, I believe the next president in January and February should go to work in building the strength of the United States.", "The Soviet Union does understand strength.", "We arm to parley, Winston Churchill said ten years ago.", "If we are strong, particularly as we face a crisis over Berlin - which we may in the spring, or in the winter - it's important that we maintain our determination here; that we indicate that we're building our strength; that we are determined to protect our position; that we're determined to protect our commitment.", "And then I believe we should indicate our desire to live at peace with the world.", "But until we're strong here, until we're moving here, I believe a summit could not be successful.", "I hope that before we do meet, there will be preliminary agreements on those four questions, or at least two of them, or even one of them, which would warrant such a meeting.", "I think if we had stuck by that position last winter, we would have been in a better position in May.", " One of the areas, and of course the most vulnerable area is - I have felt, has been Eastern Europe.", "I've been critical of the Administration's failure to suggest policies which would make it possible for us to establish, for example, closer relations with Poland, particularly after the fifty-five-fifty-six period and the Hungarian revolution.", "We indicated at that time that we were not going to intervene militarily.", "But there was a period there when Poland demonstrated a national independence and even the Polish government moved some differn- di- distance away from the Soviet Union.", "I suggested that we amend our legislation so that we could enjoy closer economic ties.", "We received the support first of the Administration and then not, and we were defeated by one vote in the Senate.", "We passed the bill in the Senate this year but it didn't pass the House.", "I would say Eastern Europe is the area of vulnerability of the uh - s- of the Soviet Union.", "Secondly, the relations between Russia and China.", "They are now engaged in a debate over whether war is the means of Communizing the world or whether they should use subversion, infiltration, economic struggles and all the rest.", "If those two powers should split, it could have great effects throughout the entire world.", "Thirdly, I believe that India represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world.", "India started from about the same place that China did.", "Chinese Communists have been moving ahead the last ten years.", "India under a free society has been making some progress.", "But if India does not succeed - with her four hundred and fifty million people, if she can't make freedom work - then people around the world are going to determine - particularly in the underdeveloped world - that the only way that they can develop their resources is through the Communist system.", "Fourth, let me say that in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the great force on our side is the desire of people to be free.", "This has expressed itself in the revolts in Eastern Europe.", "It's expressed itself in the desire of the people of Africa to be independent of Western Europe.", "They want to be free.", "And my judgment is that they don't want to give their freedom up to become Communists.", "They want to stay free, independent perhaps of us, but certainly independent of the Communists.", "And I believe if we identify ourselves with that force, if we identify ourselves with it as Lincoln, as Wilson did, as Franklin Roosevelt did, if we become known as the friend of freedom, sustaining freedom, helping freedom, helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease, helping them build their lives, I believe in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, eventually in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East, certainly in Western Europe, we can strengthen freedom.", "We can make it move.", "We can put the Communists on the defensive.", " First, with regard to Poland, when I talked to Mr. Gomulka, the present leader of Poland, for six hours in Warsaw last year, I learned something about their problems and particularly his.", "Right under the Soviet gun, with Soviet troops there, he is in a very difficult position in taking anything independent, a position which would be independent of the Soviet Union.", "And yet let's just see what we've done for Poland, A half a billion dollars worth of aid has gone to Poland, primarily economic, primarily to go to the people of Poland.", "This should continue and it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that I can testify they have so deeply within them.", "In addition we can have more exchange with Poland or with any other of the Iron Curtain countries which show some desire to take a different path than the path that has been taken by the ones that are complete satellites of the Soviet Union.", "If we are going to have the initiative in the world, we must remember that the people of Africa and Asia and Latin America don't want to be pawns simply in a struggle between two great powers - the Soviet Union and the United States.", "If we can get that across to the people of these countries, in this decade of the sixties, the struggle for freedom will be won.", " I would say that the issue will stay with us as a campaign issue just as long as Senator Kennedy persists in what I think is a fundamental error.", "He says he supports the President's position.", "He says that he voted for the resolution.", "Well just let me point this out; he voted for the resolution in 1955 which gave the president the power to use the forces of the United States to defend Formosa and the offshore islands.", "But he also voted then for an amendment - which was lost, fortunately - an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p- right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on Formosa.", "He repeated that error in 1959, in the speech that he made.", "He repeated it again in a television debate that we had.", "Either he's for the President and he's against the position that those who opposed the President in fifty-five and fifty-nine - and the Senator's position itself, stated the other day in our debate - either he is for the President and against that position or we simply have a disagreement here that must continue to be debated.", "I support the President's position.", "I have always opposed drawing a line.", "And so I would hope that Senator Kennedy in his answer today would clear it up.", "It isn't enough for him to say \"I support the President's position, that I voted for the resolution.\"", "Of course, he voted for the resolution - it was virtually unanimous.", "But the point is, what about his error in voting for the amendment, which was not adopted, and then persisting in it in fifty-nine, persisting in it in the debate.", "It's very simple for him to clear it up.", "He can say now that he no longer believes that a line should be drawn leaving these islands out of the perimeter of defense.", "If he says that, this issue will not be discussed in the campaign.", "The resolution commits the president in the United States, which I supported, to defend uh - Formosa, the Pescadores, and if it was his military judgment, these islands.", "Then the President sent a mission, composed of Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek in the spring of fifty-five to withdraw from the two islands, because they were exposed.", "The President was unsuccessful; Chiang Kai-shek would not withdraw.", "I refer to the fact that in 1958, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I'm very familiar with the position that the United States took in negotiating with the Chinese Communists on these two islands.", "General Twining, in January, fifty-nine, described the position of the United States.", "The position of the United States has been that this build-up, in the words of the president, has been foolish.", "Mr. Herter has said these islands are indefensible.", "Chiang Kai-shek will not withdraw.", "And therefore, the President's judgment has been that we should defend the islands if, in his military judgment and the judgment of the commander in the field, the attack on these islands should be part of an overall attack on Formosa.", "I support that.", "In view of the difficulties we've had with the islands, in view of the difficulties and disputes we've had with Chiang Kai-shek, that's the only position we can take.", "That's not the position you took, however.", "The first position you took, when this matter first came up, was that we should draw the line and commit ourselves, as a matter of principle, to defend these islands.", "Not as part of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores.", "You showed no recognition of the Administration program to try to persuade Chiang Kai-shek for the last five years to withdraw from the islands.", " I uh - said that I've served this country for fourteen years.", "I served it uh - in the war.", "I'm devoted to it.", "If I lose this election, I will continue in the Senate to try to build a stronger country.", "But I run because I believe this year the United States has a great opportunity to make a move forward, to make a determination here at home and around the world, that it's going to reestablish itself as a vigorous society.", "My judgment is that the Republican party has stood still here in the United States, and it's also stood still around the world.", "Uh - We're using about fifty percent of our steel capacity today.", "We had a recession in fifty-eight.", "We had a recession in fifty-four.", "We're not moving ahead in education the way we should.", "We didn't make a judgment in fifty-seven and fifty-six and fifty-five and fifty-four that outer space would be important.", "If we stand still here, if we appoint people to ambassadorships and positions in Washington who have a status quo outlook, who don't recognize that this is a revolutionary time, then the United States does not maintain its influence.", "And if we fail, the cause of freedom fails.", "I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again, to get our economy moving ahead, to set before the American people its goals, its unfinished business.", "And then throughout the world appoint the best people we can get, ambassadors who can speak the language - no mere - not merely people who made a political contribution but who can speak the language.", "Bring students here; let them see what kind of a country we have.", "Mr. Nixon said that we should not regard them as pawns in the cold war; we should identify ourselves with them.", "If that were true, why didn't we identify ourselves with the people of Africa?", "Why didn't we bring students over here?", "Why did we suddenly offer Congo three hundred students last June when they had the tremendous revolt?", "That was more than we had offered to all of Africa before from the federal government.", "I believe that this party - Republican party - has stood still really for twenty-five years - its leadership has.", "It opposed all of the programs of President Roosevelt and others - the minimum wage and for housing and economic growth and development of our natural resources, the Tennessee Valley and all the rest.", "I believe it my responsibility as the leader of the Democratic party in 1960 to try to warn the American people that in this crucial time we can no longer afford to stand still.", "We can no longer afford to be second best.", "I want people all over the world to look to the United States again, to feel that we're on the move, to feel that our high noon is in the future.", "I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States, and that they're going to put this country back to work again.", "I don't believe that there is anything this country cannot do.", "I don't believe there's any burden, or any responsibility, that any American would not assume to protect his country, to protect our security, to advance the cause of freedom.", "And I believe it incumbent upon us now to do that.", "Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that that generation of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny.", "I believe in 1960 and sixty-one and two and three we have a rendezvous with destiny.", "And I believe it incumbent upon us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom; and to do that, we must give this country leadership and we must get America moving again.", "America is not standing still.", "It has not been standing still.", "We built more houses in the last seven years than in any Administration and thirty percent more than in the previous Administration.", "We talk about schools - three times as many classrooms built in the past Administration - and Eisenhower - than under the Truman Administration.", "Let's talk about civil rights.", "More progress in the past eight years than in the whole eighty years before.", "He talks about the progress in the field of slum clearance and the like.", "We find four times as many projects undertaken and completed in this Administration than in the previous one.", "Anybody that says America has been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling in America.", "He's been in some other country.", "America has not been standing still.", "But America cannot stand pat.", "It is essential that we extend freedom, extend it to all the world.", "And this means more than what we've been doing.", "It means keeping America even stronger militarily than she is.", "It means seeing that our economy moves forward even faster than it has.", "It means making more progress in civil rights than we have so that we can be a splendid example for all the world to see - a democracy in action at its best.", "We had a good neighbor policy, yes.", "It sounded fine.", "There were eleven dictators when we came into power in 1953 in Latin America.", "There are only three left.", "Let's look at Africa.", "Twenty new countries in Africa during the course of this Administration.", "Not one of them selected a Communist government.", "All of them voted for freedom - a free type of government.", "Of course not.", "We're on the side of freedom.", "We're on the side of justice against the forces of slavery, against the forces of injustice.", "But we aren't going to move America forward and we aren't going to be able to lead the world to win this struggle for freedom if we have a permanent inferiority complex about American achievements.", "It will be determined to the extent that we represent the deepest ideals, the highest feelings and faith of the American people.", "In other words, the next president, as he leads America and the free world, can be only as great as the American people are great.", "See that the young people of America, particularly, have faith in the ideals of freedom and faith in God, which distinguishes us from the atheistic materialists who oppose us.", " Mr. Kraft, I believe that the American people, in the next four years under a Ford administration, will be called upon to make those necessary sacrifices to preserve the peace which we have.", "I think the American people will be called upon to uh - uh - be in the forefront in giving leadership to the solution of those problems that must be solved in the Middle East, in southern Africa, and any problems that might arise in the Pacific.", "The American people will be called upon to tighten their belts a bit in meeting some of the problems that we face domestically.", "I don't think that uh - America can go on a big spending spree with a whole lot of new programs uh - that would add significantly to the federal budget.", "Doesn't your policy really imply that we're going to have a fairly high rate of unemployment over a fairly long time, that growth is gonna be fairly slow, and that we're not gonna be able to do much - very much in the next four or five years to meet the basic agenda of our national needs in the cities, in health, uh in transit and a whole lot of things like that.", "Now we will probably need to increase that to same extent.", "But we don't have to have - growth in spending that will blow the lid off and add to the problems of inflation.", "I believe we can meet the problems within the cities of this country and still uh - give a tax reduction.", "I proposed, as you know, a reduction to increase the personal exemption from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars.", "With the fiscal program that I have, and if you look at the projections, it shows that we will reduce unemployment, that we will continue to win the battle against inflation, and at the same time give the kind of quality of life that I believe is possible in America.", "Uh - a job, a home for all those that'll work and save for it, uh - safety in the streets, uh - health that is a - health care that is affordable.", " Well I might say first of all that I think in case of the Carter administration the sacrifices would be much less.", "Mr. Ford's own uh - environmental agency has projected a 10 percent unemployment rate by 1978 if he's uh - president.", "If they know that they will be helping to make decisions and won't be excluded from being an involved party to the national purpose.", "The major effort we must put forward is to put our people back to work.", "And I think that this uh - is one example where uh - a lot of people have selfish, grasping ideas now.", "I remember 1973 in the depth of the uh - energy crisis when President Nixon called on the American people to make a sacrifice, to cut down on the waste of uh - gasoline, to cut down on the uh - speed of automobiles.", "It was a - a tremendous surge of patriotism, that \"I want to make a sacrifice for my country.\"", "I think we uh - could call together, with strong leadership in the White House, business, industry and labor, and say let's have voluntary price restraints.", "Let's lay down some guidelines so we don't have continuing inflation.", "We can also have a- an end to the extremes.", "We now have one extreme for instance, of some welfare recipients, who by taking advantage of the welfare laws, the housing laws, the uh - Medicaid uh - laws, and the uh - food stamp laws, make over $10 thousand a year and uh - they don't have to pay any taxes on it.", "At the other extreme, uh - just 1 percent of the richest people in our country derive 25 percent of all the tax benefits.", "But I think uh - uh - a balanced approach, with everybody being part of it and a striving for unselfishness, could help as it did in 1973 to let people sacrifice for their own country.", "I know I'm ready for it.", "I think the American people are too.", " I think the major reason for a decrease in participation that we have experienced ever since 1960 has been the deep discouragement of the American people about the performance of public officials.", "When you've got seven and a half, eight million people out of work, and you've got three times as much inflation as you had during the last eight-year Democratic administration, when you have the highest deficits in history; when you have it uh - becoming increasingly difficult far a family to put a child through college or to own a home, there's a natural inclination to be turned off.", "And I think this is uh - uh - part of uh - of just being a human being.", "And uh - the Playboy thing has been of great - very great concern to me.", "I don't know how to deal with it exactly.", "Uh - I uh - agreed to give the interview uh - to Playboy Other people have done it who are notable - uh - Governor Jerry Brown, uh - Walter Cronkite, uh - Albert Schweitzer, Mr. Ford's own secretary of the treasury, Mr. Simon, uh - William Buckley - many other people.", "But I can say this, uh - I'm doing the best I can to get away from that, and during the next ten days, the American people will not see the Carter campaign running uh - television advertisements and newspaper advertisements based on a personal attack on President Ford's character.", "I believe that the opposite is true with President Ford's campaign, and uh - I hope that we can leave those issues in this next ten days about personalities and mistakes of the past - we've both made some mistakes - and talk about unemployment, inflation, housing, education, taxation, government organization, stripping away of secrecy, and the things that are crucial to the American people.", " I believe that the uh - American people have been turned off in this election, uh - Mr. Maynard, for a variety of reasons.", "We have seen on Capitol Hill, in the Congress, uh - a great many uh - allegations of wrong-doing, of uh - alleged immorality, uh - those are very disturbing to the American people.", "They wonder how an elected representative uh - can serve them and participate in such activities uh - serving in the Congress of the United States.", "But on the other hand, I found on July fourth of this year, a new spirit born in America.", "We were celebrating our Bicentennial; and I find that uh - there is a - a movement as I travel around the country of greater interest in this campaign.", "But I do make a pledge that in the next ten days when we're asking the American people to make one of the most important decisions in their lifetime, because I think this election is one of the mast vital in the history of America, that uh - we do together what we can to stimulate voter participation.", " Well, Mr. uh - Nelson, uh - I testified before two committees, House and Senate, on precisely the questions that you have asked.", "And the testimony under oath was to the effect that I did not talk to Mr. Nixon, to Mr. Haldeman, to Mr. Ehrlichman, or to any of the people at the White House.", "I said I had no recollection whatsoever of talking with any of the White House legislative liaison people.", "I indicated under oath that the initiative that I took was at the request of the ranking members of the House Banking and Currency Committee on the Republican side, which was a legitimate request and a proper response by me.", "Now that was gone into by two congressional committees, and following that investigation, both committees overwhelmingly approved me, and the House and the Senate did likewise.", "Now, in the meantime, the special prosecutor, within the last few days, after an investigation himself, said there was no reason for him to get involved because he found nothing that would justify it.", "And then just a day or two ago, the attorney general of the United States made a further investigation and came to precisely the same conclusion.", "Those tapes are in the jurisdiction of the courts and I have no right to say \"yes\" or \"no.\"", "But all the committees, the attorney general, the special prosecutor, all of them have given me a clean bill of health.", "I think the matter is settled once and for all.", " That's for the uh - proper authorities who have control over those tapes to make that decision.", "I have given every bit of evidence, answered every question that's as- been asked me by any senator or any member of the House.", "Plus the fact, that the special prosecutor, on his own initiation, and the attorney general on his initiation, the highest law enforcement official in this country, all of them have given me a clean bill of health.", "And I've told everything I know about it.", "I think the matter is settled once and for all.", " In the last uh - two weeks, I've had a chance to talk to uh - two men who have visited uh - the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and China.", "One is Governor Avell- Averell Harriman, who visited the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and the other is James Schlesinger, whom I think you accompanied to uh - China.", "I got a- a complete report back from those countries from these two distinguished - uh - gentlemen.", "And uh - I don't believe that our security would be directly threatened if the Soviet Union went uh - into Yugoslavia.", "I don't believe it will happen.", " I firmly believe, uh - Mr. Kraft, that it's unwise for a president to signal in advance what uh - options he might exercise if any uhh - international problem arose.", "I think we all recall with some sadness that at uh - the period of the nin- late nineteen forties, early nineteen fifties, there were some indications that the United States would not include uh - South Korea in an area of defense.", "There are some who allege, I can't prove it true or untrue, that uh - such a statement uh - in effect invited the North Koreans to invade South Korea.", "It's a fact they did.", "But no president of the United States, in my opinion, should signal in advance to a prospective enemy, what his uhh - decision might be or what option he might exercise.", "It's far better for a person sitting in the White House uh - who has a number of options to make certain that the uh - other side, so to speak, doesn't know precisely what you're going to do.", "And therefore, that was the reason that I would not uh - identify any particular course of action uh - when I responded to a question a week or so ago.", " I have indicated to General Brown that uh - the words that he used in that interview, in that particular case and in several others, were very ill advised.", "General Brown has an exemply [sic] record of military performance.", "He served this nation with great, great skill and courage and bravery for thirty-five years.", "And I think it's the consensus of the people who are knowledgeable in the military field, that he is probably the outstanding military leader and strategist that we have in America today.", " Well, just briefly, I - I think this is uh - the second time that General Brown has made a statement that - for which he did have to apologize.", "And I know that everybody uh - makes mistakes.", "I think the first one was related to uh - the unwarranted influence of American Jews on the media and uh - in the Congress.", "This one concerned uh - Great Britain.", "I think he said that Israel was a - a military burden on us and that Iran hoped to reestablish the Persian Empire.", "Ah - I'm not uh - sure that I remembered earlier that President Ford had - had expressed uh - his concern about the statement or apologized for it.", "This is uh - something, though, that I think uh - is indicative of the need among the American people to know how its commander-in-chief, the president, feels and - and - and I think the only criticism that I would have uh - on - of Mr. Ford is that uh - immediately when the statement was re - re - revealed, uh - perhaps a - a statement from the president would have been a clarifying and a very beneficial thing.", " I don't believe it does.", "Uh - I began campaigning uh - twenty-two months ago.", "At that time, nobody thought I had a chance to win.", "Uh - very few people knew who I was.", "I came from a tiny town, as you know, Plains, and didn't hold public office, didn't have very much money.", "And my first organization was just four or five people plus my wife and my children, my three sons and their wives.", "And we won the nomination by going out into the streets - barbershops, beauty parlors, restaurants, stores, in factory shift lines also in farmers' markets and livestock sale barns - and we talked a lot and we listened a lot and we learned from the American people.", "And we built up uh - an awareness among the uh - voters of this country, particularly those in whose primaries I entered - thirty of them, nobody's ever done that before - about who I was and what I stood for.", "Now we have a very, very wide-ranging group of advisers who help me prepare for these debates and who teach me about international economics, and foreign affairs, defense matters, health, education, welfare, government reorganization.", "I'd say, several hundred of them.", "And they're very fine and very highly qualified.", "I chose Senator Walter Mondale.", "And I'm convinced now, more than I was when I got the nomination, that Walter Mondale was the right choice, And I believe this is a good indication of the kind of people I would choose in the future.", "I feel completely at ease knowing that someday Senator Mondale might very well be president.", "In the last five pres- vice presidential uh - nominees, uh - incumbents, three of them have become president.", "But I think this is indicative of what I would do.", "I don't mean to be critical of uh - Senator Mondale, but uh - I was uh - very, very surprised when I read that uh - Senator Mondale made a very derogatory, very personal comment about General Brown uh - after the news story that uh - broke about General Brown.", "If my recollection is correct he indicated that uh - General Brown was not qualified to be a sewer commissioner.", "I don't think that's a proper way to describe aayuh- chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who has fought for his country for thirty-five years, and I'm sure the governor would agree with me on that.", "Uh - I think Senator Dole would show more good judgment and discretion than to so describe uh - a heroic and brave and very outstanding leader of the military.", "So I think our selection uh - of Bob Dole as vice president uh - is based on merit.", "Number two, that strip-mining bill would've severely set back our need for more coal, and Governor Carter has said repeatedly that coal is the resource that we need to use more in the effort to become independent of the uh - Arab oil supply.", "But let's talk about what the Ford administration has done in the field of environment.", "I have increased, as president, by over 60 percent the funding for water treatment plants in the United States, the federal contribution.", "I have fully funded the land and water conservation program; in fact, have recommended and the Congress approved a substantially increased land and water conservation program.", "Uh - I have uh - added in the current year budget the funds for the National Park Service.", "For example, we uh - proposed about $12 million to add between four and five hundred more employees for the National Park Service.", "And a month or so ago I did uh - likewise say over the next ten years we should expand - double - this national parks, the wild wilderness areas, the scenic river areas.", "And then, of course, the - the final thing is that I have signed and approved of more scenic rivers, more wilderness areas, since I've been president than any other president in the history of the United States.", " Well, I might say that I think the League of Conservation Voters is absolutely right.", "This uh - administration's record on environment is very bad.", "Uh - I think it's accurate to say that the uh - strip-mining law which was passed twice by the Congress - uh - and was only like two votes I believe of being overridden - would have been good for the country.", "And I don't think they would have supported the uh - bill had they known that they would lose a hundred and forty thousand jobs.", "There's been a consistent policy on the part of this administration to lower or delay enforcement of air pollution standards and water pollution standards.", "And under both President Nixon and Ford, monies have been impounded that would've gone to uh - cities and others to control uh - water pollution.", "We have no energy policy.", "We, I think, are the only developed nation in the world that has no comprehensive energy policy, to permit us to plan in an orderly way how to shift from increasing the scarce uh - energy uh - forms: oil, and have research and development concentrated on the increased use of coal, which I strongly favor.", "The research and development to be used primary to make the coal burning uh - be clean.", "Uh - the lands that Mr. Ford uh - brags about having approved are in Alaska and they are enormous in uh - in size.", "But as far as the accessibility of them by the American people, it's very uh - far in the future.", "We've taken no strong position in the uh - control of pollution of our oceans, and I would say the worst uh - threat to the environment of all is nuclear proliferation.", "And this administration, having been in office now for two years or more, has still not taken strong and bold action to stop the proliferation of nuclear waste around the world, particularly plutonium.", "Those are some brief remarks about the failures of this administration.", "I would do the opposite in every respect.", "A mayor of a city like New York, for instance, needs to know uh - eighteen months or two years ahead of time what responsibility the city will have in administration and in financing - in things like housing, uh - pollution control, uh - crime control, education, welfare and health.", "This has not been done, unfortunately.", "I remember the headline in the Daily News that said, \"Ford to New York: Drop Dead.\"", "I think it's very important that our cities know that they have a partner in the federal government.", "Quite often Congress has passed laws in the past designed to help people with uh - the ownership of homes and with the control of crime and with adequate health care and education programs and so forth.", "Uh - those uh programs were designed to help those who need it most.", "And quite often this has been in the very poor people and neighborhoods in the downtown urban centers.", "Because of the uh - great -ly- greatly uh - advantaged uh - tho- per - persons who live in the suburbs, better education, better organization, more articulate, more aware of what the laws are, quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where it's needed.", "Also I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care.", "We have now uh - for instance only 7 percent of the total education cost being financed by the federal government.", "When uh - the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent.", "That's a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contributes to education in just eight years.", "And as you know, the education cost has gone up uh - tremendously.", "The last point is that the major - uh thrust has gotta be to put people back to work.", "We've got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh - particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent.", "And the concentration of employment opportunities in those areas would help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base, but also to help reduce the extraordinary welfare cost.", "One of the major responsibilities on the shoulders of uh - New York City is to - is to finance welfare.", "And I favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether.", "And over a longer period of time, let the federal government begin to absorb part of it that's now paid by the state governments.", "The Ford administration does have a very comprehensive program to help uh - our major metropolitan areas.", "I fought for, and the Congress finally went along with a general revenue sharing program, whereby cities and uh - states, uh - the cities two-thirds and the states one-third, get over six billion dollars a year in cash through which they can uh - provide many, many services, whatever they really want.", "In addition we uh - in the federal government make available to uh - cities about uh - three billion three hundred million dollars in what we call community development.", "In adesh- in addition, uh - uh - as a result of my pressure an the Congress, we got a major mass transit program uh - over a four-year period, eleven billion eight-hundred million dollars.", "We have a good housing program, uh - that uh - will result in cutting uh - the down payments by 50 percent and uh - having mortgage payments uh lower at the beginning of any mortgage period.", "We're expanding our homestead uh - housing program.", "As a matter of fact, that committee under Secretary Hills released about a seventy-five-page report with specific recommendations so we can do a better job uh - the weeks ahead.", "In the cabinet I have one of the outstanding, I think, administrators as the secretary of transportation, Bill Coleman.", "You're familiar, I'm sure, with the recognition given in the Air Force to uh - General James, and there was just uh - approved a three-star admiral, the first in the history of the United States Navy, so uh - we are giving full recognition to individuals of quality in the Ford administration in positions of great responsibility.", "In addition, uh - the Department of Justice is fully enforcing, and enforcing effectively, the Voting Rights Act, the legislation that involves jobs, housing for minorities, not only blacks but all others.", "Uh - the Department of uh - uh - HUD is enforcing the new legislation that uhh - outlaws, that takes care of redlining.", "Uh - what we're doing is saying that there are opportunities, business opportunities, educational opportunities, responsibilities uh - where people with talent, black or any other minority, can fully qualify.", "The Office of Minority Business in

Office of Small Business, under Mr. Kobelinski, has a very massive program trying to help the black community.", "The individual who wants to start a business or expand his business as a black businessman is able to borrow, either directly or with guaranteed loans.", "I believe on the record that this administration has been more responsive and we have carried out the law to the letter, and I'm proud of the record.", " The uh - description just made of this administration's record is hard to uh - recognize.", "I think it's accurate to say that Mr. Ford voted against the uh - Voting Rights Acts and the uh - Civil Rights Acts in their uh - debative stage I think once it was assured they were going to pass he finally voted for it.", "There was a time when there was hope for those who uh - were poor and downtrodden and who were - uh elderly or who were - uh ill or who were in minority groups, but that time has been gone.", "It not only liberated - uh black people but it also liberated the whites.", "We've seen uh - in many instances in recent years a minority affairs uh - section of uh Small Loan Administration, uh - Small Business Administration lend uh - a black entrepreneur just enough money to get started, and then to go bankrupt.", "The bankruptcies have gone up - uh in an extraordinary degree.", "Uh - FHA, which used to be a very responsible agency, uh - that everyone looked to to help own a home, lost six million dollars last year.", "There've been over thirteen hundred indictments in HUD, over eight hundred convictions relating just to home loans.", "And now the federal government has become the world's greatest slum landlord.", "We've got a 30 percent or 40 percent unemployment rate among minority uh - young people.", "And there's been no concerted effort given to the needs of those who are both poor and black, or poor and who speak a foreign language.", "And that's where there's been a great uh generation of despair, and ill health, and the lack of education, lack of purposefulness, and the lack of hope for the future.", "But it doesn't take just a quiet uh - dormant uh minimum enforcement of the law.", "It requires an aggressive searching out and reaching out to help people who especially need it.", "And that's been lacking in the last eight years.", " I would not work hard to support any of those.", "Uh - we've always had, I think, a lot of constitutional amendments proposed, but the passage of them has been uh - fairly slow, and uh - few and far between.", "In the two-hundred-year history there's been a very uh - cautious approach to this.", "We - quite often we have a transient problem.", "I - I'm strongly against a- abortion.", "I think abortion's wrong.", "I don't think the government oughta do anything to encourage abortion.", "But I don't favor a constitutional amendment on the subject.", "I personally don't believe that the federal government oughta finance abortions, but I - I draw the line and don't support a constitutional amendment.", "But among those you named, I won't actively work for the passage of any of them.", " support the uh - Republican uh - platform, which calls for the constitutional amendment that would uh - outlaw abortions.", "I favor the particular constitutional amendment that would turn over to the states the uh - individual right to the voters in those states uh - the chance to make a decision by public referendum.", "Uh - I think this is a responsible and a proper way to proceed.", "Uhh - I believe also that uh - there is some merit to a - an amendment that uh - uh - Senator Everett Dirksen uh - proposed very frequently, an amendment that would uh - change the court decision as far as voluntary prayer in public schools.", "Uh - it seems to me that there should have - be an opportunity, uh - as long as it's voluntary, as long as there is no uh - compulsion whatsoever, that uh - an individual ought to have that right.", "So in those two cases I think uh - such uh - a constitutional amendment would be proper, and I really don't think in either case they're trivial matters.", "I think they're matters of very deep conviction, as far as many, many people in this country believe.", "And therefore, they shouldn't be treated lightly.", "But they're matters that are ah - important.", "And in those two cases, I would favor them.", " Uh - Mr. Maynard, uh - the record of gun control, whether it's one city or another or in some states, does not show that the registration of a gun, handgun, or the registration of the gun owner, has in any way whatsoever decreased the crime rate or the use of that gun in the committing of a crime.", "The record just doesn't prove that such legislation or action by a local city council is effective.", "What we have to do, and this is the crux of the matter, is to make it very, very uh - difficult for a person who uses a gun in the commission of a crime to stay out of jail.", "If we make the use of a gun in the commission.", "I don't believe in the registration of handguns or the registration of the handgun owner.", "Those are the people who ought to be in jail.", "And the only way to do it is to pass strong legislation so that once apprehended, indicted, convicted, they'll be in jail and off the streets and not using guns in the commission of a crime.", "The person who wants to use a gun for an illegal purpose can get it whether it's registered or outlawed.", "They will be obtained.", "And they are the people who ought to go behind bars.", "You should not in the process penalize the legitimate handgun owner.", "And when you go through the process of registration, you in effect, are penalizing that individual who uses his gun for a very legitimate purpose.", " I - I think it's accurate to say that Mr. Ford's position on gun control has changed.", "Uh - earlier, uh - Mr. Levi, his uh - attorney general, put forward a gun control proposal, which Mr. Ford later, I believe, espoused, that called for the prohibition against the uh sale aw- of the uh - so-called Saturday Night Specials.", "And it would've put uh - very strict uh - uh - control over who owned a handgun.", "I have been a hunter all my life and happen to own both shotguns, rifles, and a handgun.", "And uh - the only purpose that I would see in registering uh - handguns and not long guns of any kind would be to prohibit the uh - ownership of those guns by those who've used them in the commission of a crime, or who uh - have been proven to be mentally incompetent to own a gun.", "I believe that limited approach to the - to the question would be uh - advisable, and - and I think, adequate.", "But that's as far as I would go with it.", " While I was governor of Georgia, although I'm not a lawyer, we had complete reform of the Georgia court system.", "We uh - streamlined the structure of the court, put in administrative officers, put a unified court system in, required that all uh - severe sentences be reviewed far uniformity.", "And, in addition to that put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office of selection of - for all judges and district attorneys or prosecuting attorneys, on the basis of merit.", "Every time I had a vacancy on the Georgia Supreme Court - and I filled five of those vacancies out of seven total and about half the court of appeals judges, about 35 percent of the trial judges - I was given from an objective panel the five most highly qualified persons in Georgia.", "And from those five, I always chose the first one or second one.", "So merit selection of judges is the most important single criterion.", "And I would institute the same kind of procedure as president, not only in judicial appointments, but also in diplomatic appointments.", "Secondly, I think that the Burger Court has fairly well confirmed the major and - and most far-reaching and most controversial decisions of the Warren Court.", "Civil rights - uh has been confirmed by the Burger Court, hasn't been uh - reversed, and I don't think there's any inclination to reverse those basic decisions.", "The one-man, one-vote rule, which is a very important one that uh - s- struck down the unwarranted influence in the legislature of parsley - uh populated areas of - of the states.", "The uh - right of indigent or very poor accused persons to uh - legal counsel.", "Uh - I think the Burger Court has confirmed that basic and very controversial decision of the Warren Court.", " Okay, I thought I answered it by saying that it would be on the basis of merit.", "Once the uh - search and analysis procedure had been completed, and once I'm given a list of the five or seven or ten uh - best qualified persons in the country, I would make a selection from among those uh - persons.", "Which would be uh - to continue the progress that has been made under the last two uh - courts - the Warren Court and the Burger Court.", "I would also like to uh - completely revise our criminal justice system - to do some of the things at the federal level in court reform that I've just described, as has been done in Georgia and other states.", "And then I would like to appoint people who would be interested in helping with that.", "I know that uh Chief Justice Burger is.", "He hasn't had help from the administration, from the Congress, to carry this out.", "The uh - emphasis, I think, of the - of the court system uh - should be to interpret the uh - the Constitution and the laws uh - equally between property protection and personal protection.", "And uh - that would be another factor that I would follow.", " Well, I think the answer uh - as to the kind of person that I would select uh - is obvious.", "I had one opportunity to nominate uh - an individual to the Supreme Court and I selected the Circuit Court of Appeals judge from Illinois, uh - John Paul Stevens.", "And I don't think the record justifies the conclusion that you come to.", "Uh - let me uh - talk about uh - the economic announcements that were made just this past week.", "Yes, it was announced that the uh - GNP real growth in the third quarter was at 4 percent.", "But do you realize that over the last ten years that's a higher figure than the average growth during that ten-year period?", "Now it's lower than the nine-point-point-two percent growth in the first quarter, and it's lower than the uh 5 percent growth in the second quarter.", "But every economist - liberal, conservative that I'm familiar with - recognizes that in the fourth quarter of this year and in the fifth quar- uh - the first quarter of next year that we'll have an increase in real GNP.", "But now let's talk about the pluses that came out this week.", "We had an 18 percent increase in housing starts.", "We had a substantial increase in new permits for housing.", "As a matter of fact, based on the announcement this week, there will be at an annual rate of a million, eight hundred and some thousand new houses built, which is a tremendous increase over last year and a substantial increase over the earlier part of this year.", "Now in addition, we had a very - some very good news in the reduction in the rate of inflation.", "The rate of inflation, as announced just the other day, is under 5 percent; and the uh - 4.4 percent that was indicated at the time of the 4 percent GNP was less than the 5.4 percent.", "We've got seven and a half million people out of jobs.", "Since he's been in office, two and a half million more American people have lost their jobs.", "In the last four months alone, five hundred thousand Americans have gone on the unemployment roll.", "In the last month, we've had a net loss of one hundred and sixty-three thousand jobs.", "Anybody who says that the inflation rate is in good shape now ought to talk to the housewives.", "One of the overwhelming results that I've seen in the polls is that people feel that you can't plan anymore.", "There's no way to make a prediction that my family might be able to own a home or to put my kid through college.", "Savings accounts are losing money instead of gaining money.", "Inflation is robbing us.", "Under the present administration - Nixon's and Ford's - we've had three times the inflation rate that we experienced under President Johnson and President Kennedy.", "The economic growth is less than half today what it was at the beginning of this year.", "And housing starts - he compares the housing starts with last year.", "That's thirty-five years.", "And we've got a 35 percent unemployment rate in many areas of this country among construction workers.", "And Mr. Ford hasn't done anything about it.", "And I think this shows a callous indifference to the families that have suffered so much.", "He has vetoed bills passed by Congress within the congressional budget guidelines job opportunities for two million Americans.", "That is a very serious indictment of this administration.", "It's probably the worst one of all.", " Well, that's not exactly an accurate description of what happened.", "When I was that far ahead, it was immediately following the Democratic Convention, and before the Republican Convention.", "At that time, uh - 25 or 30 percent of the Reagan supporters said that they would not support President Ford.", "But as occurred at the end of the con- Democratic Convention, the Republican Party unified itself.", "And I think immediately following the Republican Convention, there was about a ten-point spread.", "I believe that to be accurate, I had 49 percent; President Ford, 39 percent.", "Uh - the polls uh - are good indications of fluctuations, but they vary widely one from another.", "And the only poll I've ever followed is the one that uh - you know, is taken on election day.", "I was in uh - thirty primaries in the spring, and uh - at first it was obvious that I didn't have any standing in the poll.", "As a matter of fact, I think when Gallup ran their first poll in December of 1975 they didn't put my name on the list.", "They had thirty-five people on the list.", "My name wasn't even there.", "And at the beginning of the year I had about 2 percent.", "So the polls to me are interesting, but they don't determine, you know, my hopes or - or my despair.", "I campaign among people.", "I've never depended on powerful political figures to put me in office.", "I have a direct relationship with hundreds of people around - hundreds of thousands around the country who actively campaign for me.", "In Georgia alone, for instance, I got 84 percent of the vote, and I think there were fourteen people uh - in addition to myself on the ballot, and Governor Wallace had been very strong in Georgia.", "That's an overwhelming support from my own people who know me best.", "And today, we have about five hundred Georgians at their own expense - just working people who believe in me - spread around the country uh - involved in the political campaign.", "I think a lot of it uh - depends on current events - uh - sometimes foreign affairs, sometimes domestic affairs.", "But I think our hold uh - of support among those who uh - are crucial to the election has been fairly steady.", "And my success in the primary season was, I think, notable for a newcomer, from someone who's from outside Washington, who - who never has been a part of the Washington establishment.", "And I think that we'll have good results uh - on November the second for myself and I hope for the country.", " I think uh - the uh - increase and the uh - prospects as far as I'm concerned and the I - less favorable prospects for Governor Carter, reflect that Governor Carter uh - is inconsistent in many of the positions that he takes.", "He tends to distort on a number of occasions.", "Uh - just a moment ago, for example, uh - he uh - was indicating that uh - uh - in the 1950s, for example, uh - unemployment was very low.", "He fails to point out that uh - in the 1950s we were engaged in the war in Vietnam.", "We - I mean in Korea - we had uh - three million five hundred thousand young men uh - in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines.", "That's not the way to end unemployment or to reduce unemployment.", "At the present time we're at peace.", "We have reduced the number of people in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines from three million, one hundred - three million, five hundred thousand to two mil- lion one hundred thousand.", "We are not at war.", "We have reduced the military manpower by a million four hundred thousand.", "But this administration doesn't believe the way to reduce unemployment is to go to war, or to increase the number of people in the military.", "They're in the civilian labor market and they're not fighting anywhere around the world today.", " For twenty-five years I served in the Congress under five presidents.", "I saw them work, I saw them make very hard decisions.", "I didn't always agree with their decisions, whether they were Democratic or Republican presidents.", "I became president at the time that the United States was in a very troubled time.", "We had inflation of over 12 percent, we were on the brink of the worst recession in the last forty years, we were still deeply involved in the problems of Vietnam.", "The American people had lost faith and trust and confidence in the presidency itself.", "I think most people know that I did not seek the presidency.", "But those are not the things that count.", "What counts is, that the United States celebrated its 200th birthday on July fourth.", "The American people are healed, are working together.", "The American people are moving again, and moving in the right direction.", "We have cut inflation by better than half.", "We have came out of the recession and we're well on the road to real prosperity in this country again.", "I have never promised more than I could produce and I have produced everything that I promised.", "We are at peace.", "Not a single young American is fighting or dying on any foreign soil tonight.", "I don't believe the present administration has done that.", "We have been discouraged and we've been alienated.", "Sometimes we've been embarrassed and sometimes we've been ashamed.", "Our people are out of work, and there's a sense of withdrawal.", "My own background is different from his.", "I was a school board member, and a library board member.", "I served an a hospital authority.", "And I was in the state senate and I was governor and I'm an engineer, a Naval officer, a farmer, a businessman.", "And I believe we require someone who can work harmoniously with the Congress, who can work closely with the people of this country, and who can bring a new image and a new spirit to Washington.", "Our tax structure is a disgrace, it needs to be reformed.", "I was Governor of Georgia for four years.", "We never increased sales taxes or income tax or property tax.", "As a matter of fact, the year before I went out of office we gave a $50 million refund to the property taxpayers of Georgia.", "We spend six hundred dollars per person in this country - every man, woman and child - for health care.", "We still rank fifteenth among all the nations of the world in infant mortality.", "And our cancer rate is uh - higher than any country in the world.", "We don't have good health care.", "We could have it.", "Employment ought to be restored to our people.", "We've become almost a welfare state.", "We spend now 700 percent more on unemployment compensation than we did eight years ago when the Republicans took over the White House.", "Our people wanna go back to work.", "Our education system can be improved.", "Secrecy ought to be stripped away from government and a maximum of personal privacy ought to be maintained.", "Our housing programs have uh - gone bad.", "It used to be that the average - uh family could own a house.", "But now less than a third of our people can afford to buy their own homes.", "This doesn't have to be.", "Now I don't know all the answers.", "Nobody could.", "But I do know that if the president of the United States and the Congress of the United States and the people of the United States said, \"I believe our nation is greater than what we are now.\"", "We might have to do it slowly.", "There are no magic answers to do it.", "But I believe together we can make great progress.", "I believe in the greatness of our country, and I believe the American people are ready for a change in Washington.", "We've been drifting too long.", "We've been dormant too long.", "We've been discouraged too long.", "And we have not set an example for our own people.", "But I believe that we can now establish in the White House a good relationship with Congress, a good relationship with our people, set very high goals for our country.", "And with inspiration and hard work we can achieve great things.", " Mr. Hankins, I don't feel good about it, and I think we ought to have a patient's bill of rights to take the medical decisions away from the HMOs and give them back to the doctors and nurses.", "He was a fantastic governor of Missouri.", "This state became one of the top five in the nation for health care coverage for children under his leadership.", "One of the best in advancing all kinds of benefits for children to grow up healthy and strong.", "Now, Mr. Hankins, I think that the situation that you describe has gotten completely out of hand.", "Doctors are giving prescriptions, they're recommending treatments, and then their recommendations are being overruled by HMOs and insurance companies.", "That is unacceptable.", "I support a strong national patient's bill of rights.", "It is actually a disagreement between us, a national law that is pending on this, the Dingle-Norwood bill, a bipartisan bill, is one that I support and that the governor does not.", " I, too, want to extend my prayers and blessings, God's blessings on the families whose lives were overturned yes -- tod -- last night.", "It's a tragic moment.", "Actually, Mr. Vice President, it's not true.", "I do support a national patient's bill of rights.", "As a matter of fact, I brought Republicans and Democrats together to do just that in the State of Texas to get a patient's bill of rights through.", "It requires a different kind of leadership style to do it, though.", "You see, in order to get something done on behalf of the people, you have to put partisanship aside, and that's what we did in my state.", "We have one of the most advanced patient's bill of rights.", "It says, for example, that a woman doesn't have to go through a gate keeper to go to her gynecologist.", "It says that you can't gag a doctor, doctor can advise you.", "The HMO, the insurance company, can't gag that doctor from giving you full advice.", "And this particular bill, it allows patients to choose a doctor, their own doctor if they want to.", "But we did something else that was interesting.", "We're one of the first states that said you can sue an HMO for denying you proper coverage.", "Now there's what's called an Independent Review Organization that you have to go through first.", "It says if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a complaint with your insurance company, you can take your complaint to an objective body.", "If the objective body rules on your behalf, the insurance company must follow those rules.", "However, if the insurance company doesn't follow the findings of the IRO, then that becomes a cause of action in a court of law.", "It's time for our nation to come together and do what's right for the people, and I think this is right for the people.", "You know, I support a national patient's bill of rights, Mr. Vice President, and I want all people covered.", "I don't want the law to supersede good law like we've got in Texas.", "I referred to the Dingle-Norwood bill.", "It is the bipartisan bill that is now pending in the Congress.", "It is being blocked by the Republican leadership in the Congress.", " Well, the difference is is that I can get it done.", "That I can get something positive done on behalf of the people.", "That's what the question in this campaign is about.", "It's not only what's your philosophy and what's your position on issues, but can you get things done?", "And I believe I can.", "If I'm the president, we're going to have emergency room care, we're going have gag orders, we're going to have direct access to OB/GYN.", "People will be able to take their HMO insurance company to court.", "That's what I've done in Texas and that's the kind of leadership style I'll bring to Washington.", "I think one of the problems we have, particularly for seniors, is there is no prescription drug coverage in Medicare.", "And therefore, when they have to try to purchase drugs they do so on their own, there's no kind of collective bargaining, no power of purchasing among seniors.", "So I think step one to make sure prescription drugs is more affordable for seniors, and those are the folks who really rely upon prescription drugs a lot these days, is to reform the Medicare system, is to have prescription drugs as an integral part of Medicare once and for all.", "The problem we have today is like the patient's bill of rights, particularly with health care, there's a lot of bickering in Washington, D.C.", "It's kind of like a political issue as opposed to a people issue.", "So what I want to do is I want to call upon Republicans and Democrats to forget all the arguing and finger pointing, and come together and take care of our seniors' prescription drug program, that says we'll pay for the poor seniors, we'll help all seniors with prescription drugs.", "In the meantime, I think it's important to have what's called Immediate Helping Hand, which is direct money to states so that seniors, poor seniors, don't have to choose between food and medicine.", "That's part of an overall overhaul.", "And I'm against price controls.", "I think price controls would hurt our ability to continue important research and development.", "One of the most important things is to continue the research and development component.", "And so I'm against price controls.", "Expediting drugs through the FDA makes sense, of course.", "Allowing the new bill that was passed in the Congress made sense to allow for, you know, drugs that were sold overseas to come back and other countries to come back into the United States.", "That makes sense.", "But the best thing to do is to reform Medicare.", "Listen, for 24 years I have never been afraid to take on the big drug companies.", "They do some great things.", "We want them to continue that.", "But they are now spending more money on advertising and promotion.", "You see all these ads?", "Than they are on research and development.", "I want to streamline the approval of the competing generic drugs and the new kinds of treatments that can compete with them so we bring the price down for everybody.", "I propose a real prescription drug benefit under Medicare for all seniors, all seniors, and here's how it works.", "You pick your own doctor, and nobody can take that away from you.", "You go to your own pharmacy and then Medicare pays half the price.", "If you're poor, they pay all of it.", "If you have extraordinarily high cost, then they pay all over $4,000 out-of-pocket.", "And I'll bring new competition to bring the price down.", "And if you pass the big drug companies' bill, nothing will happen.", " I think that we should move step-by-step toward universal health coverage, but I am not in favor of government doing it all.", "We've spent 65 years now on the development of a hybrid system, partly private, partly public, and 85% of our people have health insurance, 15% don't.", "That adds up to 44 million people.", "That is a national outrage.", "We have got to deal with long-term care.", "I will make a commitment to bring health care coverage of high quality that is affordable to every single child in America within four years.", "And then we'll fill other gaps by covering the parents of those children when the family is poor or up to two and a half times the poverty rate.", "I want to give a tax credit for the purchase of individual health insurance plans.", "I want to give small business employers a tax credit, 25%, to encourage the providing of health insurance for the employees in small businesses.", "Now, we have a big difference on this.", "And you need to know the record here.", "Under Governor Bush, Texas has sunk to be 50th out of 50 in health care -- in health insurance for their citizens.", " I'm absolutely opposed to a national health care plan.", "I don't want the federal government making decisions for consumers or for providers.", "I remember what the administration tried to do in 1993.", "They tried to have a national health care plan.", "And fortunately, it failed.", "I trust people, I don't trust the federal government.", "It's going to be one of the themes you hear tonight.", "I don't want the federal government making decisions on behalf of everybody.", "There is an issue with the uninsured, there sure is.", "And we have uninsured people in my state.", "Ours is a big state, a fast-growing state.", "But we're providing health care for our people.", "The question is, are people getting health care, and we have a strong safety net, and there needs to be a safety net in America.", "There needs to be more community health clinics where the poor can go get health care.", "We need a program for the uninsured.", "We need to have -- allow small businesses to write insurance across jurisdictional

have strong accountability because you can't cure unless you know.", "You can't solve a problem unless you diagnose it.", "I strongly believe that one of the best things to encourage parental involvement also is to know that the classrooms will be safe and secure.", "They can't be sued.", "I think parents will be more involved with education when they know their children's classrooms are safe and secure as well.", "I also believe that we need to say to people that if you cannot meet standards, there has to be a consequence.", "Instead of just comes the soft bigotry of low

designated as failing, the kids would be trapped there for another three years and then some of them would get federal vouchers and the state would be forced to match those, that money.", "Under my plan, if a school is failing, we work with the states to give them the authority and the resources to close down that school and reopen it right away with a new principal, a new faculty, a turn-around

relief.", "Under my plan, if you make -- the top -- the wealthy people pay 62% of the taxes today.", "Afterwards they pay 64%.", "This is a fair plan.", "Because the tax code is unfair for people at

ask them.", "But if everyone here in this audience was dead on in the middle of the middle-class, then the tax cuts for every single one of you all added up would be less than the tax cut his plan

death penalty.", "I think that it has to be administered not only fairly with attention to things like DNA evidence, which I think should be used in all capital cases, but also with very careful attention.", "If the wrong guy is put to death, then that's a double tragedy.", "Not only has an innocent person been executed, but the real perpetrator of the crime has not been held accountable for it.", "And in some cases may be still at large.", "But I support the death penalty in the most heinous cases.", "It's the only reason to be for it.", "I don't think you should support the death penalty to seek revenge.", "I don't think that's right.", "I think the reason to support the death penalty is because it saves other people's lives.", " I think it is a deterrent.", "I know that's a controversial view, but I do believe it's a deterrent.", "(LAUGHTER) I am a person who keeps promises.", "And, you know, we've heard a lot about -- from the governor about not much being done in the last eight years, as if the promises that I made eight years ago have not been kept.", "I think the record shows otherwise.", "We have gone from the biggest deficits eight years ago to the biggest surpluses in history today.", "Instead of high unemployment, we now have the lowest African-American unemployment, the lowest Latino unemployment ever measured.", "22 million new jobs, very low unemployment nationally.", "Instead of ballooning the debt and multiplying it four times over, we have seen the debt actually begun to be paid down.", "I will balance the budget every year.", "I will pay down the debt every year.", "I will give middle-class Americans tax cuts, meaningful ones.", "And I will invest in education, health care, protecting the environment and retirement security.", "I promise you I will keep mine.", "Let me tell you about one of the governor's.", "He has promised a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund for young working adults to invest and save on their own.", "But he's promised seniors that their Social Security benefits will not be cut, and he's promised the same trillion dollars to them.", "So this is a show me state.", "You asked about promises.", "You were promised that Medicare would be reformed, and that Social Security would be reformed.", "You were promised a middle-class tax cut in 1992.", "It didn't happen.", "There's too much bitterness in Washington.", "There's too much wrangling.", "It's time to have a fresh start.", "One of the reasons I was successful as the governor of Texas is because I didn't try to be all things to all people.", "When I campaigned in a race, a lot of folks didn't think I could win including, by the way, my mother.", "And I had the will of the people in my state behind me.", "And then I brought folks together to get it done.", "And that's what we need, I think, in this election.", "To me that's what it's all about.", "I'm sure your 6th grade kids are listening and saying, these guys will say anything to get elected.", "But there's a record, and that's what I hope people look at.", "One of my promises is going to be Social Security reform, and you bet, we need to take a trillion dollars out of that $2.4 trillion surplus.", "Now remember, Social Security revenue exceeds expenses up until 2015.", "People are going to get paid.", "But if you're a younger worker, if you're younger, you better hope this country thinks differently, otherwise you're gonna be faced with huge payroll taxes or reduced benefits.", "That's one of my promises.", "But it's gonna require people to bring both Republicans and Democrats together to get it done.", "That's what it requires.", "There was a chance to get this done.", "It was a bipartisan approach, but it's been rejected.", "I'm going to bring them together.", "Because the trillion dollars that has been promised to young people has also been promised to older people.", "And you cannot keep both promises.", "If you're in your mid-40's under the governor's plan, Social Security will be bankrupt by the time you retire, if he takes it out of the Social Security Trust Fund.", "Under my plan it will be -- its solvency will be extended until you're 100.", "Now that is the difference.", "And the governor may not want to answer that question, he may want to call it a high school debating trick, but let me tell you this.", "This election is not about debating tricks, it is about your future.", "You know, it's not a bank account that just pays back money that's invested.", "It is also used to give your mothers and fathers the Social Security checks that they live on.", "If you take a trillion dollars out of that Social Security Trust Fund, how are the checks going to be -- how are you going to keep faith with the seniors?", "One reason people are skeptical is because people don't answer the questions they've been asked.", "There's just a difference of opinion.", "I want workers to have their own assets.", "It's who you trust, government or people.", "I keep my word.", "I have kept the faith.", "I've kept the faith with my country.", "I volunteered for the Army.", "I served in Vietnam.", "I kept the faith with my family.", "We have devoted ourselves to our children and now our nearly one-and-a-half-year-old grandson.", "I have kept the faith with our country.", "I have not spent the last quarter century in pursuit of personal wealth.", "I have spent the last quarter century fighting for middle-class working men and women in the United States of America.", "I believe very deeply that you have to be willing to stand up and fight no matter what powerful forces might be on the other side.", "If you want somebody who is willing to fight for you, I am asking for your support and your vote and, yes, your confidence and your willingness to believe that we can do the right thing in America, and be the better for it.", "We've made some progress during the last eight years.", "We have seen the strongest economy in the history of the United States.", "Lower crime rates for eight years in a row.", "You ain't seen nothing yet.", "And I will keep that promise.", "There is a difference between big federal government and somebody who is coming from outside of Washington who will trust individuals.", "I've got an agenda that I want to get done for the country.", "It's an agenda that says we're going to reform Medicare to make sure seniors have got prescription drugs and to give seniors different options from which they can choose.", "It's an agenda that says we're listen to the young voices in Social Security and say we're going to think differently about making sure we have a system, but also fulfill the promise to the seniors in America.", "I want to have the military keeping the peace.", "I want to make sure the public school system in America keeps its promise so not one child is left behind.", "After setting priorities, I want to give some of your money back.", "I don't think the surplus is the government's money.", "I think it's the people's money.", "I don't think the surplus exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the federal government, I think it exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the American people.", "And you ought to have some of this surplus so you can save and dream and build.", "Should I be fortunate enough to become your president, when I put my hand on the Bible, I will swear to not only uphold the laws of the land, but I will also swear to uphold the honor and the dignity of the office to which I have been elected, so help me God.", "Therefore, the burden of maintaining the peace falls on us.", "And to maintain that peace requires strength.", "America has never gotten in a war because we were too strong.", "And good management in preserving the peace requires that we control the events and try to intercept before they become a crisis.", "I have seen four wars in my lifetime.", "I'm a father of sons; I have a grandson.", "I don't ever want to see another generation of young Americans bleed their lives into sandy beachheads in the Pacific, or rice paddies and jungles in the in Asia or the muddy battlefields of Europe.", "And my tax cut does not come close to eliminating that $86 billion increase.", "I'm only reducing the amount of the increase.", "In other words, what I'm talking about is not putting government back to getting less money than government's been getting, but simply cutting the increase in in spending.", " Mr. Stone, I've had to make thousands of decisions since I've been President, serving in the Oval Office.", "And with each one of those decisions that affect the future of my country, I have learned in the process.", "I think I'm a much wiser and more experienced man than I was when I debated four years ago against President Ford.", "I've also learned that there are no simple answers to complicated questions.", "H. L. Mencken said that for every problem there's a simple answer.", "It would be neat and plausible and wrong.", "The fact is that this nation, in the eight years before I became President, had its own military strength decreased.", "Seven out of eight years, the budget commitments for defense went down, 37% in all.", "Since I've been in office, we've had a steady, carefully planned, methodical but, very effective increase in our commitment for defense.", "But what we've done is use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace.", "We've not only kept peace for our own country, but we've been able to extend the benefits of peace to others.", "In the Middle East, we've worked for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, successfully, and have tied ourselves together with Israel and Egypt in a common defense capability.", "I might also add that there are decisions that are made in the Oval Office by every President which are profound in nature.", "There are always trouble spots in the world, and how those troubled areas are addressed by a President alone in that Oval Office affects our nation directly, the involvement of the United States and also our American interests.", " Mr. Stone, in my State of the Union address earlier this year, I pointed out that any threat to the stability or security of the Persian Gulf would be a threat to the security of our own country.", "In the past, we have not had an adequate military presence in that region.", "Now we have two major carrier task forces.", "We have access to facilities in five different areas of that region.", "And we've made it clear that working with our allies and others, that we are prepared to address any foreseeable eventuality which might interrupt commerce with that crucial area of the world.", "This, I believe, has assured that our interests will be protected in the Persian Gulf region, as we have done in the Middle East and throughout the world.", " Well yes, I question the figure about the decline in defense spending under the two previous Administrations in the preceding eight years to this Administration.", "I would call to your attention that we were in a war that wound down during those eight years, which of course made a change in military spending because of turning from war to peace.", "I also would like to point out that Republican presidents in those years, faced with a Democratic majority in both houses of the Congress, found that their requests for defense budgets were very often cut.", " Well, there are various elements of defense.", "Another one is how to address troubled areas of the world.", "But I'll always remember that the best weapons are the ones that are never fired in combat, and the best soldier is one who never has to lay his life down on the field of battle.", "Strength is imperative for peace, but the two must go hand in hand.", "In 1974, we had a so-called oil shock, wherein the price of OPEC oil was raised to an extraordinary degree.", "We had an even worse oil shock in 1979.", "In 1974, we had the worst recession, the deepest and most penetrating recession since the Second World War.", "The recession that resulted this time was the briefest since the Second World War.", "In addition, we've brought down inflation.", "Earlier this year, in the first quarter, we did have a very severe inflation pressure brought about by the OPEC price increase.", "It averaged about 18% in the first quarter of this year.", "In the second quarter, we had dropped it down to about 13%.", "which his own running mate, George Bush, described as voodoo economics, and said that it would result in a 30% inflation rate.", "And Business Week, which is not a Democratic publication, said that this Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal - and I quote them, I think - was completely irresponsible and would result in inflationary pressures which would destroy this nation.", "So our proposals are very sound and very carefully considered to stimulate jobs, to improve the industrial complex of this country, to create tools for American workers, and at the same time would be anti-inflationary in nature.", "So to add nine million new jobs, to control inflation, and to plan for the future with an energy policy now intact as a foundation is our plan for the years ahead.", "As a matter of fact, we're importing today about one-third less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago.", "We've had a 25% reduction since the first year I was in office.", "At the same time, as I have said earlier, we have added about nine million net new jobs in that period of time - a record never before achieved.", "The new economic revitalization program that we have in mind, which will be implemented next year, would result in tax credits which would let business invest in new tools and new factories to create even more new jobs - about one million in the next two years.", "And we also have planned a youth employment program which would encompass 600,000 jobs for young people.", " Mr. Ellis, I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore it's uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious and it's dangerous to say this to the people.", "When Mr. Carter became President, inflation was 4.8%, as you said.", "It had been cut in two by President Gerald Ford.", "It is now running at 12.7%.", "President Carter also has spoken of the new jobs created.", "Well, we always, with the normal growth in our country and increase in population, increase the number of jobs.", "But that can't hide the fact that there are eight million men and women out of work in America today, and two million of those lost their jobs in just the last few months.", "Mr. Carter had also promised that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight against inflation.", "And yet, his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation, because in January, at the beginning of the year, it was more than 18%.", "We don't have inflation because the people are living too well.", "We have inflation because the Government is living too well.", "And my economic plan calls for that.", "The President's economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way.", "I believe that there is enough extravagance and fat in government.", "As a matter of fact, one of the secretaries of HEW under Mr. Carter testified that he thought there was $7 billion worth of fraud and waste in welfare and in the medical programs associated with it.", "Office estimate that there is probably tens of billions of dollars that is lost in fraud alone, and they have added that waste adds even more to that.", "We have a program for a gradual reduction of Government spending based on these theories, and I have a task force now that has been working on where those cuts could be made.", "And inflation went down below the national average in California when we returned the money to the people and reduced Government spending.", " Governor Reagan's proposal, the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal, is one of the most highly inflationary ideas that ever has been presented to the American public.", "He would actually have to cut Government spending by at least $130 billion in order to balance the budget under this ridiculous proposal.", "I notice that his task force that is working for his future plans had some of their ideas revealed in The Wall Street Journal this week.", "One of those ideas was to repeal the minimum wage, and several times this year, Governor Reagan has said that the major cause of unemployment is the minimum wage.", "In California - I'm surprised Governor Reagan brought this up - he had the three largest tax increases in the history of that state under his administration.", "The size of government increased only one-sixth in California of what it increased in proportion to the population in Georgia.", "Let the local entity, the city, declare this particular area, based on the standards of the percentage of people on welfare, unemployed, and so forth, in that area.", "And then, through tax incentives, induce the creation of businesses providing jobs and so forth in those areas.", "I think there are things to do in this regard.", "I stood in the South Bronx on the exact spot that President Carter stood on in 1977.", "You have to see it to believe it.", "It looks like a bombed-out city - great, gaunt skeletons of buildings.", "Windows smashed out, painted on one of them \"Unkept promises;\" on another, \"Despair.\"", "And this was the spot at which President Carter had promised that he was going to bring in a vast program to rebuild this department.", "There are whole or this area there are whole blocks of land that are left bare, just bulldozed down flat.", " I believe in it.", "I am eternally optimistic, and I happen to believe that we've made great progress from the days when I was young and when this country didn't even know it had a racial problem.", "It's a bully pulpit.", "And I think that something can be done from there, because a goal for all of us should be that one day, things will be done neither because of nor in spite of any of the differences between us - ethnic differences or racial differences, whatever they may be - that we will have total equal opportunity for all people.", "And I would do everything I could in my power to bring that about.", "This has been a very successful effort.", "That's one of the main reasons that we've had such an increase in the number of people employed.", "Of the nine million people put to work in new jobs since I've been in office, 1.3 million of those has been among black Americans, and another million among those who speak Spanish.", "We now are planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of rapid transit, mass transit.", "Under the windfall profits tax, we expect to spend about $43 billion in the next 10 years to rebuild the transportation systems of our country.", "We also are pursuing housing programs.", "We've had a 73% increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education.", "These are the kinds of efforts worked on a joint basis with community leaders, particularly in the minority areas of the central cities that have been deteriorating so rapidly in the past.", "It's very important to us that this be done with the full involvement of minority citizens.", "I have brought into the top level, top levels of government, into the White House, into administrative offices of the Executive branch, into the judicial system, highly qualified black and Spanish citizens and women who in the past had been excluded.", "We have gone a long way toward correcting these problems, but we still have a long way to go.", " Ours is a nation of refugees, a nation of immigrants.", "Almost all of our citizens came here from other lands and now have hopes, which are being realized, for a better life, preserving their ethnic commitments, their family structures, their religious beliefs, preserving their relationships with their relatives in foreign countries, but still holding themselves together in a very coherent society, which gives our nation its strength.", "In the past, those minority groups have often been excluded from participation in the affairs of government.", "Since I've been President, I've appointed, for instance, more than twice as many black Federal judges as all previous presidents in the history of this country.", "I've done the same thing in the appointment of women, and also Spanish-speaking Americans.", "To involve them in the administration of government and the feeling that they belong to the societal structure that makes decisions in the judiciary and in the executive branch is a very important commitment which I am trying to realize and will continue to do so in the future.", "But as governor, when I was at that end of the line and receiving some of these grants for Government programs, I saw that so many of them were dead-end.", "They were public employment that these people who really want to get out into the private job market where there are jobs with a future.", "I wish he could have been with me when I sat with a group of teenagers who were black, and who were telling me about their unemployment problems, and that it was the minimum wage that had done away with the jobs that they once could get.", "And indeed, every time it has increased you will find there is an increase in minority unemployment among young people.", "And therefore, I have been in favor of a separate minimum for them.", "With regard to the great progress that has been made with this Government spending, the rate of black unemployment in Detroit, Michigan, is 56%.", " It's obvious that we still have a long way to go in fully incorporating the minority groups into the mainstream of American life.", "We have made good progress, and there is no doubt in my mind that the commitment to unemployment compensation, the minimum wage, welfare, national health insurance, those kinds of commitments that have typified the Democratic party since ancient history in this country's political life are a very important element of the future.", "This, to me, is a very important difference between him and me in this election, and I believe the American people will judge accordingly.", " Barbara, one of the blights on this world is the threat and the activities of terrorists.", "Airplane hijacking was one of the elements of that commitment.", "There is no doubt that we have seen in recent years - in recent months - additional acts of violence against Jews in France and, of course, against those who live in Israel, by the PLO and other terrorist organizations.", "Ultimately, the most serious terrorist threat is if one of those radical nations, who believe in terrorism as a policy, should have atomic weapons.", "Both I and all my predecessors have had a deep commitment to controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons.", "And recently when he was asked specifically about Iraq, he said there is nothing we can do about it.", " We will maintain our position of neutrality in the Iran and Iraq war.", "We have no plans to sell additional materiel or goods to Iran, that might be of a warlike nature.", "When I made my decision to stop all trade with Iran as a result of the taking of our hostages, I announced then, and have consistently maintained since then, that if the hostages are released safely, we would make delivery on those items which Iran owns - which they have bought and paid for - also, that the frozen Iranian assets would be released.", "That's been a consistent policy, one I intend to carry out.", "I have been accused lately of having a secret plan with regard to the hostages.", "Now, this comes from an answer that I've made at least 50 times during this campaign to the press, when I am asked have you any ideas of what you would do if you were there?", "And I think that anyone that's seeking this position, as well as other people, probably, have thought to themselves, what about this, what about that?", "These are just ideas of what I would think of if I were in that position and had access to the information, and which I would know all the options that were open to me.", "What I do think should be done, once they are safely here with their families, and that tragedy is over - we've endured this humiliation for just lacking one week of a year now - then, I think, it is time for us to have a complete investigation as to the diplomatic efforts that were made in the beginning, why they have been there so long, and when they came home, what did we have to do in order to bring that about - what arrangements were made?", "And I would suggest that Congress should hold such an investigation.", "And we've been guilty of that.", "Because someone didn't meet exactly our standards of human rights, even though they were an ally of ours, instead of trying patiently to persuade them to change their ways, we have, in a number of instances, aided a revolutionary overthrow which results in complete totalitarianism, instead, for those people.", "Now, there was a second phase in the Iranian affair in which we had something to do with that.", "And that was, we had adequate warning that there was a threat to our embassy, and we could have done what other embassies did - either strengthen our security there, or remove our personnel before the kidnap and the takeover took place.", "What the Western allies did decide to do is to stop all air flights - commercial air flights - to any nation involved in terrorism or the hijacking of air planes, or the harboring of hijackers.", "Secondly, we all committed ourselves, as have all my predecessors in the Oval Office not to permit the spread of nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation, or to any other nation that does not presently have those weapons or capabilities for explosives.", "Third, not to make any sales of materiel or weapons to a nation which is involved in terrorist activities.", "And, lastly, not to deal with the PLO until and unless the PLO recognizes Israel's right to exist and recognizes UN Resolution 242 as a basis for Middle East peace.", "I have never made the statement that he suggested about nuclear proliferation and nuclear proliferation, or the trying to halt it, would be a major part of a foreign policy of mine.", "The SALT II treaty was the result of negotiations that Mr. Carter's team entered into after he had asked the Soviet Union for a discussion of actual reduction of nuclear strategic weapons.", "And his emissary, I think, came home in 12 hours having heard a very definite nyet.", "But taking that one no from the Soviet Union, we then went back into negotiations on their terms, because Mr. Carter had canceled the B-I bomber, delayed the MX, delayed the Trident submarine, delayed the cruise missile, shut down the Missile Man - the three - the Minuteman missile production line, and whatever other things that might have been done.", "The Soviet Union sat at the table knowing that we had gone forward with unilateral concessions without any reciprocation from them whatsoever.", "It has been blocked by a Senate in which there is a Democratic majority.", "Indeed, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 0, with seven abstentions, against the SALT II treaty, and declared that it was not in the national security interests of the United States.", "To negotiate with the Soviet Union a balanced, controlled, observable, and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry, there is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of Governor Reagan.", "He has never supported any of those arms control agreements - the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford - and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a seven-year period, by myself and my two Republican predecessors.", "The Senate has not voted yet on the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty.", "There have been preliminary skirmishing in the committees of the Senate, but the Treaty has never come to the floor of the Senate for either a debate or a vote.", "It's understandable that a Senator in the preliminary debates can make an irresponsible statement, or, maybe, an ill-advised statement.", "You've got 99 other senators to correct that mistake, if it is a mistake.", "But when a man who hopes to be President says, take this treaty, discard it, do not vote, do not debate, do not explore the issues, do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation - that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing.", "Governor Reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements.", "He not only advocates the scrapping of this treaty - and I don't know that these men that he quotes are against the treaty in its final form - but he also advocates the possibility, he said it's been a missing element, of playing a trump card against the Soviet Union of a nuclear arms race, and is insisting upon nuclear superiority by our own nation, as a predication for negotiation in the future with the Soviet Union.", "If President Brezhnev said, we will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American Presidents over a seven-year period of time, we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, it's obvious that I, as President, and all Americans, would reject such a proposition.", "This would mean the resumption of a very dangerous nuclear arms race.", "It would be very disturbing to American people.", "It would change the basic tone and commitment that our nation has experienced ever since the Second World War, with al Presidents, Democratic and Republican.", "And it would also be very disturbing to our allies, all of whom support this nuclear arms treaty.", "In addition to that, the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly.", "This attitude is extremely dangerous and belligerent in its tone, although it's said with a quiet voice.", "My point I have made already, Mr. President, with regard to negotiating: it does not call for nuclear superiority on the part of the United States.", "It calls for a mutual reduction of these weapons, as I say, that neither of us can represent a threat to the other.", "And to suggest that the SALT II treaty that your negotiators negotiated was just a continuation, and based on all of the preceding efforts by two previous Presidents, is just not true.", "And I think our allies would be very happy to go along with a fair and verifiable SALT agreement.", "This is a formidable force.", "Some of these weapons have 10 megatons of explosion.", "If you put 50 tons of TNT in each one of railroad cars, you would have a carload of TNT - a trainload of TNT stretching across this nation.", "That's one major war explosion in a warhead.", "We have thousands, equivalent of megaton, or million tons, of TNT warheads.", "We've been very successful in both cases.", "We've now reduced the importing of foreign oil in the last year alone by one-third.", "We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same date just a year ago.", "We will drill more oil and gas wells this year than any year in history.", "We'll produce more coal this year than any year in history.", "We are exporting more coal this year than any year in history.", "And we have an opportunity now with improved transportation systems and improved loading facilities in our ports, to see a very good opportunity on a world international market, to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source.", " I'm not so sure that it means steadily higher fuel costs, but I do believe that this nation has been portrayed for too long a time to the people as being energy-poor when it is energy-rich.", "The coal that the President mentioned - yes, we have it - and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now.", "The mines are closed down; there are 22000 miners out of work.", "Most of this is due to regulations which either interfere with the mining of it or prevent the burning of it:.", "With our modern technology, yes, we can burn our coal within the limits of the Clean Air Act.", "I think, as technology improves, we'll be able to do even better with that.", "The other thing is that we have only leased out - begun to explore - 2% of our outer continental shelf for oil, where it is believed, by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy, that there are vast supplies yet to be found.", "Our Government has, in the last year or so, taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were - well, they were public lands subject to multiple use - exploration for minerals and so forth.", "It is believed that probably 70% of the potential oil in the United States is probably hidden in those lands, and no one is allowed to even go and explore to find out if it is there.", "This is particularly true of the recent efforts to shut down part of Alaska.", " There were 36 power plants planned in this country.", "We have the sources here.", "We are energy rich, and coal is one of the great potentials we have.", " To repeat myself, we have this year the opportunity, which we'll realize, to produce 800 million tons of coal - an unequaled record in the history of our country.", "Governor Reagan says that this is not a good achievement, and he blames restraints on coal production on regulations - regulations that affect the life and the health and safety of miners, and also regulations that protect the purity of our air and the quality our water and our land.", "We cannot cast aside these regulations.", "We have a chance in the next 15 years, insisting upon the health and safety of workers in the mines, and also preserving the same high air and water pollution standards, to triple the amount of coal we produce.", "He wants to put all our eggs in one basket and give that basket to the major oil companies.", " That is a misstatement, of course, of my position.", "I just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a better job of producing the things that people need than government can.", "The Department of Energy has a multi-billion-dollar budget in excess of $10 billion.", "It hasn't produced a quart of oil or a lump of coal, or anything else in the line of energy.", "As Governor of California, I took charge of passing the strictest air pollution laws in the United States - the strictest air quality law that has even been adopted in the United States.", "And we created an OSHA - an Occupational Safety and Health Agency - for the protection of employees before the Federal Government had one in place.", "And to this day, not one of its decisions or rulings has ever been challenged.", "So, I think some of those charges are missing the point.", "I am suggesting that there are literally thousands of unnecessary regulations that invade every facet of business, and indeed, very much of our personal lives, that are unnecessary; that Government can do without; that have added $130 billion to the cost of production in this country; and that are contributing their part to inflation.", "the air pollution standard laws that were passed in California were passed over the objections of Governor Reagan, and this is a very well-known fact.", "Also, recently, when someone suggested that the Occupational Safety and Health Act should be abolished, Governor Reagan responded, amen.", "As a matter of fact, in the proposal for the Alaska lands legislation, 100% of all the offshore lands would be open for exploration, and 95% of all the Alaska lands, where it is suspected or believed that minerals might exist.", "We have, with our five-year plan for the leasing of offshore lands, proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954.", "So we're not putting restraints on American exploration, we're encouraging it in every way we can.", "We still have the strictest air control, or air pollution laws in the country.", "As for offshore oiling, only 2% now is so leased and is producing oil.", "There is more oil now, in the wells that have been drilled, than has been taken out in 121 years that they've been drilled.", " The Social Security system was based on a false premise, with regard to how fast the number of workers would increase and how fast the number of retirees would increase.", "Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance, and the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history - the payroll tax increase for Social Security - which will only put a band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most.", "We cannot frighten, as we have with the threats and the campaign rhetoric that has gone on in this campaign, our senior citizens - leave them thinking that in some way, they're endangered and they would have no place to turn.", "They must continue to get those checks, and I believe that the system can be put on a sound actuarial basis.", "But it's going to take some study and some work, and not just passing a tax increase to let the load - or the roof - fall in on the next administration.", " As long as there is a Democratic President in the White House, we will have a strong and viable Social Security System, free of the threat of bankruptcy.", "I noticed also in The Wall Street Journal early this week, that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making Social Security more sound by reducing the adjustment in Social Security for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation.", "These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security, the well being and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age.", "But no matter what it takes in the future to keep Social Security sound, it must be kept that way.", "And although there was a serious threat to the Social Security System and its integrity during the 1976 campaign and when I became President, the action of the Democratic Congress working with me has been to put Social Security back on a sound financial basis.", "That is the way it will stay.", "Mr. President, the voluntary thing that I suggested many years ago was that with a young man orphaned and raised by an aunt who died, his aunt was ineligible for Social Security insurance because she was not his mother.", "And I suggested that if this is an insurance program, certainly the person who is paying in should be able to name his own beneficiary.", "That is the closest I have ever come to anything voluntary with Social Security.", "I, too, am pledged to a Social Security program that will reassure these senior citizens of ours that they are going to continue to get their money.", "There are some changes that I would like to make.", "I would like to make a change in the regulation that discriminates against a wife who works and finds that she then is faced with a choice between her father's or her husband's benefits, if he dies first, or what she has paid in; but it does not recognize that she has also been paying in herself, and she is entitled to more than she presently can get.", "I'd like to change that.", "It is obvious that we should have a commitment to them, that Social Security benefits should not be taxed and that there would be no peremptory change in the standards by which Social Security payments are made to retired people.", "These are the kinds of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people.", " When I opposed Medicare, there was another piece of legislation meeting the same problem before the Congress.", "I happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought that it would be better for the senior citizens and provide better care than the one that was finally passed.", "I was not opposing the principle of providing care for them.", "I was opposing one piece of legislation versus another.", " I think this debate on Social Security, Medicare, national health insurance typifies, as vividly any other subject tonight, the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and Republican Party.", "The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation.", "These commitments that the Democratic Party has historically made to the working families of this nation have been extremely important to the growth in their stature and in a better quality of life for them.", "I noticed recently that Governor Reagan frequently quotes Democratic presidents in his acceptance address.", "So, it is good fo the American people to remember that there is a sharp basic historical difference between Governor Reagan and me on these crucial issues - also, between the two parties that we represent.", "First of all, there is the historical perspective that I just described.", "The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who don't presently have it, particularly terrorist nations.", "The inclination that Governor Reagan has exemplified in many troubled times since he has been running for President - I think since 1968 - to inject American military forces in places like North Korea, to put a blockade around Cuba this year, or in some instances, to project American forces into a fishing dispute against the small nation of Ecuador on the west coast of South America.", "This is typical of his long-standing inclination, on the use of American power, not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully, but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it.", " Well, Barbara, I believe that there is a fundamental difference - and I think it has been evident in most of the answers that Mr. Carter has given tonight - that he seeks the solution to anything as another opportunity for a Federal Government program.", "I happen to believe that the Federal Government has usurped powers of autonomy and authority that belong back at the state and local level.", "It has imposed on the individual freedoms of the people, and there are more of these things that could be solved by the people themselves, if they were given a chance, or by the levels of government that were closer to them.", "Now, as to why I should be and he shouldn't be, when he was a candidate in 1976, President Carter invented a thing he called the misery index.", "He added the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation, and it came, at that time, to 12.5% under President Ford.", "He said that no man with that size misery index has a right to seek reelection to the Presidency.", "But the President that I quoted had made a promise, a Democratic promise, and I quoted him because it was never kept.", "And today, you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today.", "It was a promise for less government and less taxes and more freedom for the people.", "I don't think that can be better illustrated than in the case of guaranteeing women equal rights under the Constitution of our nation.", "For 40 years, the Republican Party platforms called for guaranteeing women equal rights with a constitutional amendment.", "Six predecessors of mine who served in the Oval Office called for this guarantee of women's rights.", "Governor Reagan and his new Republican Party have departed from this commitment - a very severe blow to the opportunity for women to finally correct discrimination under which they have suffered.", "When a man and a women do the same amount of work, a man gets paid $1.00, a women only gets paid 59 cents.", "And the equal rights amendment only says that equality of rights shall not be abridged for omen b the Federal Government or by he state governments.", "While I was Governor, more than eight years ago, I found 14 separate instances where women were discriminated against in the body of California law, and I had passed and signed into law 14 statutes that eliminated those discriminations, including the economic ones that you have just mentioned - equal pay and so forth.", "If I were President, I would also now take a look at the hundreds of Federal regulations which discriminate against women and which go right on while everyone is looking for an amendment.", "I would have someone ride herd on those regulations, and we would start eliminating those discriminations in the Federal Government against women.", " Howard, I'm a Southerner, and I share the basic beliefs of my region that an excessive government intrusion into the private affairs of American citizens and also into the private affairs of the free enterprise system.", "One of the commitments that I made was to deregulate the major industries of this country.", "We've been remarkably successful, with the help of a Democratic Congress.", "We have deregulated the air industry, the rail industry, the trucking industry, financial institutions.", "We're now working on the communications industry.", "We have made remarkable success.", "It is part of my consciousness and of my commitment to continue this progress.", "But I would like to call the attention of the people to the fact that that so-called simple amendment would be used by mischievous men to destroy discriminations that properly belong, by law, to women respecting the physical differences between the two sexes, labor laws that protect them against things that would be physically harmful to them.", "Those would all, could all be challenged by men.", "And the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth.", "I think it's been a very constructive debate and I hope it's helped to acquaint the American people with the sharp differences between myself and Governor Reagan.", "I've been President now for almost four years.", "I've had to make thousands of decisions, and each one of those decisions has been a learning process.", "I've seen the strength of my nation, and I've seen the crises it approached in a tentative way.", "And I've had to deal with those crises as best I could.", "As I've studied the record between myself and Governor Reagan, I've been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us.", "I think the result of this debate indicates that that fact is true.", "I consider myself in the mainstream of my party.", "I consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of Presidents who served before me.", "The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure.", "We must have a society that's just and fair.", "And we must extend the benefits of our own commitment to peace, to create a peaceful world.", "I believe that since I've been in office, there have been six or eight areas of combat evolved in other parts of the world.", "In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country.", "I've done that with moderation, with care, with thoughtfulness; sometimes consulting experts.", "But, I've learned in this last three and a half years that when an issue is extremely difficult, when the call is very close, the chances are the experts will be divided almost 50-50.", "And the final judgment about the future of the nation - war, peace, involvement, reticence, thoughtfulness, care, consideration, concern - has to be made by the man in the Oval Office.", "And I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference.", "If one vote per precinct had changed in 1960, John Kennedy would never have been President of this nation.", "And if a few more people had gone to the polls and voted in 1968, Hubert Humphrey would have been President; Richard Nixon would not.", "To stay strong, to stay at peace, to raise high the banner of human rights, to set an example for the rest of the world, to let our deep beliefs and commitments be felt by others in other nations, is my plan for the future.", "This country doesn't have to be in the shape that it is in.", "We do not have to go on sharing in scarcity with the country getting worse off, with unemployment growing.", "If all of the unemployed today were in a single line allowing two feet for each of them, that line would reach from New York City to Los Angeles, California.", "All of this can be cured and all of it can be solved.", "I have not had the experience the President has had in holding that office, but I think in being Governor of California, the most populous state in the Union - if it were a nation, it would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world - I, too, had some lonely moments and decisions to make.", "I know that the economic program that I have proposed for this nation in the next few years can resolve many of the problems that trouble us today.", "We cut the cost - the increased cost of government - in half over the eight years.", "We returned $5.7 billion in tax rebates, credits and cuts to our people.", "We, as I have said earlier, fell below the national average in inflation when we did that.", "And I know that we did give back authority and autonomy to the people.", "I would like to have a crusade today, and I would like to lead that crusade with your help.", " Well, I've been governor of a small state for 12 years.", "Every year Congress and the president sign laws that make us do more things and gives us less money to do it with.", "I see people in my state, middle class people -- their taxes have gone up in Washington and their services have gone down while the wealthy have gotten tax cuts.", "I have seen what's happened in this last 4 years when -- in my state, when people lose their jobs there's a good chance I'll know them by their names.", "When a factory closes, I know the people who ran it.", "When the businesses go bankrupt, I know them.", "And I've been out here for 13 months meeting in meetings just like this ever since October, with people like you all over America, people that have lost their jobs, lost their livelihood, lost their health insurance.", "What I want you to understand is the national debt is not the only cause of that.", "It is because America has not invested in its people.", "It is because we've had 12 years of trickle down economics.", "We've gone from first to twelfth in the world in wages.", "We've had 4 years where we've produced no private sector jobs.", "Most people are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago.", "It is because we are in the grip of a failed economic theory.", "And this decision you're about to make better be about what kind of economic theory you want, not just people saying I'm going to go fix it but what are we going to do?", "I think we have to do is invest in American jobs, American education, control American health care costs and bring the American people together again.", "What you have to decide is who's got the best economic plan.", "And we all have ideas out there, and Mr. Bush has a record.", "Now, specifically, one, on Medicare, it is not true that everyone knows how to fix it.", "There are different ideas -- the Bush plan, the Perot plan, the Clinton -- we have different ideas.", "I am convinced, having studied health care for a year hard and talking to hundreds and hundreds of people all across America, that you cannot control the cost of Medicare until you control the cost of private health care and public health care, with managed competition, ceiling on cost, and radical reorganization of the insurance markets.", "You've got to do that; we got to get those costs down.", "Social Security is in surplus $70 billion.", "What I would do is to bring in the pension experts of the country, take a look at it, and strengthen the pension requirements further, because it's not just enough to have the guarantee.", "We had a guarantee on the S&amp;Ls, right?", "We had a guarantee -- and what happened?", "You picked up a $500-billion bill because of the dumb way the federal government deregulated it.", "So I think we are going to have to change and strengthen the pension requirements on private retirement plans.", "The end of the Cold War brings an incredible opportunity for change.", "Winds of freedom blowing around the world, Russia demilitarizing.", "And it also requires us to maintain some continuity -- some bipartisan American commitment to certain principles.", "I think that defense needs to be -- with fewer people in permanent armed services but with greater mobility on the land, in the air and on the sea, with a real dedication to continuing development of high technology weaponry and well trained people.", "I think we're going to have to work to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.", "Got to keep going until all those nuclear weapons in Russia are gone and the other republics.", "We can't have any more instances like what happened when Mr. Bush went to Japan and the Japanese prime minister said he felt sympathy for our country.", "We have to be the strongest economic power in the world.", "That's what got me into this race, so we could rebuild the American economy.", "We can't impose it, but we need to nourish it and that's the kind of thing that I would do as president -- follow those three commitments into the future.", " First of all, let me say that I've spent more of my time and life on this in the last 12 years than any other issue.", "Seventy percent of my state's money goes to the public schools, and I was really honored when Time magazine said that our schools have shown more improvement than any other state in the country except one other -- they named 2 states showing real strides forward in the 80s.", "We live in a world where what you earn depends on what you can learn, where the average 18- year-old will change jobs 8 times in a lifetime and where none of us can promise any of you that what you now do for a living is absolutely safe from now on.", "Number one, under my program we would provide matching funds to states to teach everybody with a job to read in the next 5 years and give everybody with a job the chance to get a high school diploma, in big places on the job.", "Number 2, we would provide 2-year apprenticeship programs to high school graduates who don't go to college.", "And community colleges are on the job.", "Number three, we'd open the doors to college education to high school graduates without regard to income.", "They could borrow the money and pay it back as a percentage of their income or with a couple of years of service to our nation here at home.", "Number 4, we would fully fund the Head Start program to get little kids off to a good start.", "I don't think we should spend tax money on private schools.", "But I favor public school choice, and I favor radical decentralization in giving more power to better-trained principals and teachers with parent councils to control their schools.", "Those things would revolutionize American education and take us to the top economically.", "The other stuff -- all the other stuff I mentioned -- costs much less than that.", "The Head Start program full funding would cost about 5 billion more.", "It's all covered in the plan.", "Including the parents in the preschool education of their kids, even if they're poor and uneducated, can make a huge difference.", "We have a big program in my state that teaches mothers or fathers to teach their kids to get ready for school.", "It's the most successful thing we've ever done.", "We do not spend a higher percentage of our income on public education than every other country.", "There are 9 countries that spend more than we do on public education.", "We spend more on education 'cause we spend so much more on colleges.", "But if you look at public education alone and you take into account the fact that we have more racial diversity and more poverty, it makes a big difference.", "There are great public schools where there's public school choice, accountability and brilliant principals.", "It's as good as any private school in the country.", " I believe that this country is electing more and more African Americans and Latinos and Asian Americans who are representing districts that are themselves not necessarily of a majority of their race.", "More and more women are being elected.", "Look at all these women Senate candidates we have here.", "And you know, according to my mother and my wife and my daughter, this world would be a lot better place if women were running it most of the time.", "I do think there are special experiences and judgments and backgrounds and understandings that women bring to this process, by the way.", "I mean, women know what's it like to be paid an unequal amount for equal work.", "They know what it's like not to have flexible working hours.", "They know what it's like not to have family leave or childcare.", "So I think it would be a good thing for America if it happened.", "And I think it will happen in my lifetime.", "These problems are not easy.", "They're not going to be solved overnight.", "Our schools are now better.", "Our children get off to a better start from pre-school programs and smaller classes in the early grades, and we have one of the most aggressive adult education programs in the country.", "This year my state ranks first in the country in job growth, 4th in manufacturing in job growth, 4th in income growth, 4th in the decline of poverty.", "That's why we've had 24 retired generals and admirals, hundreds of business people, many of them Republican, support this campaign.", "You have to decide whether you want to change or not.", "We do not need 4 more years of an economic theory that doesn't work.", "We've had 12 years of trickle down economics.", "It's time to put the American people first, to invest and grow this economy.", "I'm the only person here who's ever balanced a government budget and I've presented 12 of them and cut spending repeatedly.", "But you cannot just get there by balancing the budget.", "We've got to grow the economy by putting people first -- real people like you.", "We're better than that.", "We can do better than that.", "I want to make America as great as it can be and I ask for your help in doing it.", "And I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life.", "We've done so in my own state.", "And it's one of the reasons why we have had the biggest drop in crime of any industrial state in America; why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in America.", "But we have work to do in this nation.", "We have work to do to fight a real war, not a phony war, against drugs.", "We have much to do to step up that war, to double the number of drug enforcement agents, to fight both here and abroad, to work with our neighbors in this hemisphere.", "And I want to call a hemispheric summit just as soon after the 20th of January as possible to fight that war.", "But we also have to deal with drug education prevention here at home.", "We've had great success in my own state.", "And we've reached out to young people and their families and been able to help them by beginning drug education and prevention in the early elementary grades.", "So we can fight this war, and we can win this war.", "And we can do so in a way that marshals our forces, that provides real support for state and local law enforcement officers who have not been getting that support, and do it in a way which will bring down violence in this nation, will help our youngsters to stay away from drugs, will stop this avalanche of drugs that's pouring into the country, and will make it possible for our kids and our families to grow up in safe and secure and decent neighborhoods.", "And I'm glad that the Congress moved on this drug bill and have finally called for that related to these narcotics drug kingpins.", " I'd have confidence in him.", "And I made a good selection.", "And I've never seen such a pounding, an unfair pounding, on a young Senator in my entire life.", "And I've never seen a presidential campaign where the presidential nominee runs against my vice presidential nominee; never seen one before.", " But you know, Lloyd Bentsen jumped on Dan Quayle, when Dan Quayle said, he's had roughly the same amount of experience.", "He had two terms in the Congress.", "He had two terms in the Senate, serving his second term.", "He founded authored, the job training partnership act.", "It says to American working men and women that are thrown out of work for no fault of their own that they're going to have jobs.", "If we'd listened to them, we would never have had a treaty.", "And so I have great confidence in him.", "And it's turning around.", "You know, the American people are fair.", "They don't like it when there's an unfair pounding and kind of hooting about people.", "They want to judge it on the record itself.", "And so I'm proud of my choice.", "And you know, I don't think age is the only criterion.", "But I'll tell you something, I'm proud that people who are 30 years old and 40 years old now have someone in their generation that is going to be vice president of the United States of America.", "I made a good selection.", "The American people are seeing it, and I'm proud of it; that's what I'd say.", "And he could do the job.", " Bernard, this was the first presidential decision that we as nominees were called upon to make.", "And that's why people are so concerned.", "Because it was an opportunity for us to demonstrate what we were looking for in a running mate.", "More than that, it was the first national security decision that we had to make.", "The Vice President talks about national security.", "Three times since World War II, the Vice President has had to suddenly become the President and commander in chief.", "I picked Lloyd Bentsen, because I thought he was the best qualified person for the job.", "And the main point is, taxes have been cut, and yet income is up to the Federal Government by 25 percent in the last three years.", "And so what I want to do is keep this expansion going.", "I don't want to kill it off by a tax increase.", "More Americans at work today than at any time in the history of the country, and a greater percentage of the work force.", "And the way you kill expansions is to raise taxes.", "And I don't want to do that, and I won't do that.", "And what I have proposed is something much better.", "And it's going to take discipline of the executive branch; it's going to take discipline of the congressional branch.", "And that is what I call a flexible freeze that allows growth about 4 percent or the rate of inflation but does not permit the Congress just to add on spending.", " Ann, the Vice President made that pledge.", "He's broken it three times in the past year already.", "So it isn't worth the paper it's printed on.", "And he's been proposing all kinds of programs for new spending costing billions.", "Now if we continue with these policies, this trillion and a half dollars worth of new debt that's already been added on the backs of the American taxpayer is going to increase even more, and if we continue with this for another four years, then I'm worried about the next generation, whether we can ever turn this situation around.", "No, we need a chief executive who is prepared to lead; who won't blame the Congress; who will lead to bring down that deficit, who will make tough choices on spending", " will go out and do the job that we expect of him and do it with the Congress of the United States.", "There is no way of anticipating what may happen.", " that we will set as our goal a steady, gradual reduction of the deficit, which will require tough choices on spending; it will require a good strong rate of economic growth; it will require a plan that the president works out with the Congress doesn't blame them, works it out with them, which brings that deficit down; it will require us to go out and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren't being paid in this country.", "And that's grossly unfair to the average American who is paying his taxes and paying them on time and doesn't have any alternative: it's taken out of his paycheck.", "Mr. Bush says we are going to put the IRS on every taxpayer.", "That's not what we are going to do.", "I'm for the taxpayer bill of rights.", "But I think it's unconscionable, Ann, that we should be talking or thinking about imposing new taxes on average Americans when there are billions out there, over $100 billion, in taxes owed that aren't being paid.", "We can do all of those things, and at the same time build a future in which we are standing on a good strong fiscal foundation.", "Senator Bentsen said, as you recall at the debate with Senator Quayle, that if you give any of us $200 billion worth of hot checks a year, we can create an illusion of prosperity.", "But sooner or later that credit card mentality isn't going to work.", "And I want to bring to the White House a sense of strength and fiscal responsibility which will build a good strong foundation under which this country, or above which country can move, grow, invest, and build the best America for its people and for our kids and our grandkids.", " The Governor has to balance the budget in his state he is required to by law.", "He has raised taxes several times.", "I wish he would join me, as a matter of fact, in appealing to the American people for the balanced budget amendment for the federal government and for the line-item veto.", "And I won't do one other thing that he's had to do: took $29 million out of his state pension fund that's equivalent at the federal level of taking out of the Social Security trust fund.", "I'm not going to do that; I won't do that.", "(Applause) And so I'm still a little unclear as to whether he's for or against the tax increase.", "And this idea of unleashing a whole bunch-an army, a conventional force army, of IRS agents into everybody's kitchen I mean, he's against most defense matters, and now he wants to get an army of JRS auditors going out there.", "(Laughter) I'm against that; I oppose that.", "As a matter of fact, I'm the first governor in the history of my state to fund that pension system, and I'm very proud of that.", "(Applause) I have been in politics for twenty-five years, Margaret; I've won a lot of elections, I've lost a few, as you know, and learned from those losses.", "I won the Democratic nomination in fifty-one separate contests.", "I think I'm a reasonably likable guy.", "(Laughter, scattered applause) I'm serious though I think I'm a little more lovable these days than I used to be back in my youth when I began in my state legislature.", "But I'm also a serious guy.", "I think the presidency of the United States is a very serious office, and I think we have to address these issues in a very serious way.", "(Laughter) But I also think it's important to be somebody who is willing to make those tough choices.", "I repeat, within days after you made that pledge, you broke it; you said, well, maybe as a last resort we'll do it.", "And you supported legislation this year that's involved tax increases not once, but twice.", "So that pledge isn't realistic, and I think the vice president knows it; I think the people of this country know it.", "But more than that, to do the kind of job that I'm elected to do, will do it with as much good humor as I can, but at the same time will do it in a way which will achieve the goals we want for ourselves and our people.", " I don't think it's a question of whether people like you or not to make you an effective leader.", "You have to learn from experience that making unilateral cuts in defense system is not the way that you enhance peace.", "You've got to understand that it is only the United States that can stand for freedom and democracy around the world and we can't turn it over to the United Nations or other multilateral organizations.", "It is, though, trying to understand the heartbeat of the country.", "And what I've had to do is define, not just my position, but to define his and I hope I've done it fairly.", "And the reason I've had to do that is that he ran on the left in the Democratic primary, ran firmly and ran with conviction and ran on his record.", "And then at that Democratic convention, they made a determination and they said there, ideology doesn't matter, just competence.", "And in the process the negatives began.", "It wasn't me that was there at that convention.", "Thank God I was up in the with Jimmy Baker camping out and I didn't have to hear all the personal attacks on me out of that Democratic convention.", "And I'm not the one that compared the President of the United States rotting from like a dead fish from the head down.", "I didn't do that.", "But I have defined the issues and I am not going to let Governor Dukakis go through this election without explaining some of these very liberal position he's the one a liberal, traditional liberal a progressive liberal Democrat.", "He's the one that brought up, to garner primary votes, the whole question of the ACLU.", "And I have enormous difference with the ACLU on their politic agenda.", "Not on their defending some minority opinion on the right or the left.", "I support that.", " Well, Margaret, we've heard it again tonight and I'm not surprised, the labels.", "I guess the Vice President two or three times, said I was coming from the left.", "In 1980, President Reagan called you a liberal for voting for Federal gun control.", "And this is something Republicans have used for a long time.", "They tried it with Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and John Kennedy.", "It's not labels.", "It's our vision of America.", "And we have two fundamentally different visions of America.", "The Vice President is complacent, thinks we ought to stick with the status quo, doesn't think we ought to move ahead, thinking things are okay as they are.", "I don't.", "We've always been a nation which was ambitious for America and we move forward.", "And that's the kind of America I want.", "That's the kind of leadership I want to provide.", "I'll give you one, that HMET, that heavy truck, that's cost what is it $850 million and the Pentagon didn't request it and, yet, a member of Congress, a very powerful one, put it in the budget.", "I think we can save money through this whole very sophisticated concept, Andrea, that I know you do understand of competitive strategies.", "It is new and it is very very different than what's happened, but it's not quite ready to be totally implemented.", "But it's very important.", "So, it's not a question of saying our budget is full of a lot of waste.", "I don't believe that.", "We're in the serious stages of negotiation with the Soviet Union on the strategic arms control talks.", "And we're protecting a couple of options in terms of modernizing our strategic forces.", "My Secretary of Defense is going to have to make a very difficult decision in which system to go forward with.", "But we are protecting both of them.", "The Soviets are modernizing.", "We can't do that.", " Well, Andrea, we've just had another example of why the Vice President's mathematics just don't add up.", "I think you know because you've covered these issues, that there's no way that we can build all of the weapons the Vice President says he wants to build within the defense budget.", "Everybody knows that including the people at the Pentagon.", "Now, my defense secretary is going to have a lot to do with those decisions, but it's going to be the President who's going to have to ultimately decide before that budget goes to the Congress what weapons systems are going to go and what are going to stay.", "We are not going to spend the billions and trillions that Mr. Bush wants to spend on Star Wars.", "We're not going to spend hundreds of millions on a space plane from Washington to Tokyo.", "Those are decisions that the chief executive has to make.", "Yes, we're going to have a strong and credible and effective nuclear deterrent.", "We're going to go forward with the Stealth and the D-5 and the advance cruise missile and good conventional forces.", "But the next President of the United States will have to make some tough and difficult decisions.", "I'm prepared to make them, the Vice President is not.", "But there are limits to what we can spend.", "There are limits to this nation's ability to finance these weapons systems.", "So military security and economic security go hand in hand.", "And we will have a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent.", "We're going to have conventional forces that are well maintained, well equipped, well trained, well supported.", "And we also have important domestic priorities, in education and housing and health care, in economic development, in job training, in the environment.", "And all of these things are going to have to be addressed.", "I want the men and women of our Armed Forces to have the support they need to defend us; the support they need when they risk our lives to keep us free and to keep this country free.", "But we cannot continue to live on a credit card.", "We cannot continue to tell the American people that we're going to build all of these systems, and at the same time, invest in important things here at home, and be serious about building a strong and good America.", "And that's the kind of America I want to build.", " I think the foremost responsibility of a president really gets down to the national security of this country.", "The Governor talks about limits, what we can't do, opposes these two modernization systems, talks now about well, we'll develop some new kind of a missile.", "It takes eight years, ten years, to do that.", "He talked about a nuclear freeze back at the time when I was in Europe trying to convince European public opinion that we ought to go forward with the deployment of the INF weapons.", "They were wrong.", "And the result is, we deployed, and the Soviets kept deploying, and then we negotiated from strength.", "And now we have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age to ban weapons.", "You just don't make unilateral cuts in the naive hope that the Soviets are going to behave themselves.", "Peace through strength works.", "But there are many people who I admire in this country today.", "Some of them are in public life in the Senate, the Congress.", "Some of my fellow governors who are real heroes to me.", "I think of those young athletes who represented us at the Olympics were tremendously impressive.", "I can think of doctors and scientists, Jonas Salk who for example discovered a vaccine which cured one of the most dread diseases we ever had.", "And he's a hero.", "I think of classroom teachers, classroom teachers that I have had, classroom teachers that youngsters have today who are real heroes to our young people.", "Because they inspire them.", "They teach them.", "Members of the clergy who have done the same.", "Drug counselors out there in the street who are providing help to youngsters who come up to me and others who ask for help and want help, are doing the hard work, the heroic work, which it takes to provide that kind of leadership, that kind of counseling, that kind of support.", "I think of people in the law enforcement community who are taking their lives in their hands everyday, when they go up to one of those doors and kick it down and try to stop this flow of drugs into our communities and into our kids.", "So there are many, many heroes in this country today.", "These are people that give of themselves everyday and every week and every month.", "In many cases they are people in the community who are examples, and are role models.", " I think of a teacher right here, largely Hispanic school, Jaime Escalante, teaching calculus to young kids, 80 percent of them going on to college.", "I think of a young man now in this country named Villadaris, who was released from a Cuban jail.", "Came out and told the truth in this brilliant book, Against All Hope, about what is actually happening in Cuba.", "I think of those people that took us back into space again, Rick Houk and that crew, as people that are worthy of this.", "I agree with the Governor on athletics.", "I think of Dr. Fauci.", "He's a very fine research, top doctor, at the National Institute of Health, working hard doing something about research on this disease of AIDS.", "But look, I also think we ought to give a little credit to the President of the United States.", "He is the one who has gotten us that first arms control agreement.", " say, he is our hero.", "And we saw the Governor and his son on television the night before and his family, and his mother who was there.", "But we used that as a role model, the way he took understandable pride in his heritage, what his family means to him.", "And we've got a strong family.", "And we said, hey, we've got to unleash the Bush kids.", "And so you saw ten grandchildren there jumping all over their grandfather at the convention.", "You see our five kids, all over this country, and their spouses.", "And so I would say that the concept of the Dukakis family has my great respect.", "I think the man anybody that gets into this political arena and has to face you guys everyday deserves a word of praise.", "Because it's gotten a little ugly out there.", "It's gotten a little nasty.", "It's not much fun sometimes.", "I've been in politics a long time, and I don't remember that kind of piling on, that kind of ugly rumor that never was true, printed.", "So some of it is unfair.", "But he's in the arena.", "Teddy Roosevelt used to talk about the arena, you know, daring to fail greatly or succeed, no matter.", "He's in there.", " That's not bad.", "That's true.", " And doesn't that prove the point, George, which is that values like family and education and community, decent homes for young people that family on Long Island I visited on Monday where Lou and Betty Tolamo (phonetic) bought a house for some $19,000 back in 1962, have had seven children, they're all making good livings.", "They can't live in the community which they grew up in.", "Those are basic American values.", "I believe in them.", "I think you believe in them.", "They're not left or right.", "They're decent American values.", "I guess the one thing that concerns me about this, Ann, is this attempt to label things which all of us believe in.", "We may have different approaches.", "We may think that you deal with them in different ways.", "George Bush believes in them.", "I think the vast majority of Americans believe in them.", "I think the American people would appreciate that.", "Barb and I lost a child, you know that we lost a daughter, Robin.", "I was over running records in west Texas, and I got a call from her, come home; went to the doctor; the doctor said, beautiful child, your child has a few weeks to live.", "And I said, what can we do about it.", "He said, no, she has leukemia, acute leukemia, a few weeks to live.", "Thanks to the miraculous sacrifice of doctors and nurses, the child stayed alive for six months and then died.", "If that child were here today, and I was told the same thing, my granddaughter, Noel for example that child could stay alive for ten or fifteen years, or maybe for the rest of her life.", "And so I don't think that you make an exception based on medical knowledge at the time.", "I think human life is very, very precious.", "But when I was in that little church across the river from Washington and saw our grandchild christened in our faith, I was very pleased indeed that the mother had not aborted that child, and put the child up for adoption.", "And so I just feel this is where I'm coming from.", "And I don't assail him on that issue, or others on that issue.", "But that's the way I, George Bush, feel about it.", "(Applause) And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.", "No, I don't happen to share that goal.", "It's an example of how oftentimes we may be associated with organizations all of whose particular positions we don't support, even though we support in general the hope that over time, particularly if we can get those reductions in strategic weapons, if we can get a comprehensive test ban treaty, if we can negotiate with the Soviet Union and bring down the level of conventional forces in Europe with deeper cuts in the Soviet side, yes, at some point it may be possible to reduce defense outlays and use those for important things here at home, like jobs and job training and college opportunity and health and housing and the environment and the things that all of us care about.", "But I do think this, that the next president, even within a relatively stable budget and that's what we are going to have for the foreseeable future will have to make those tough choices that I was talking about and that Mr. Bush doesn't seem to want to make.", "And that really is going to be a challenge for the next president of the United States; I don't think there's any question about it.", "But I also see a tremendous opportunity now to negotiate with the Soviet Union to build on the progress that we've made with the INF Treaty, which I strongly supported and most Democrats did to get those reductions in strategic weapons, to get a test ban treaty, and to really make progress on the reduction of conventional forces in Europe.", "So I hope that we can begin to move those resources.", "But it certainly ought to be the long-term goal of all Americans and I think it is.", " The defense budget today takes far less percentage of the gross national product than it did in President Kennedy's time, for example moved tremendously.", "And you see, I think we're facing a real opportunity for world peace.", "And it's a question as to whether the United States will continue to lead for peace.", "See, I don't believe any other country can pick up the mantel.", "I served at the UN.", "I don't think we can turn over these kinds of decisions of the collective defense to the United Nations or anything else.", "I said I would have the Secretary of Defense sit down.", "But while the President is negotiating with the Soviet Union, I simply do not want to make these unilateral cuts.", "The Soviets take out more than we do and the principle of intrusive verification.", "And those two principles can now be applied to conventional forces, to strategic forces, provided", " We don't give away our hand before we sit down at the head table.", "We don't have an alternative.", "We'll lose it when it's taken out of our paycheck before we even get it.", "But it's the Internal Revenue Service which estimates now that we aren't collecting $100 billion or more in taxes owed in this country.", "The Dorgan Task Force, which included two internal revenue commissioners, one a Republican, one a Democrat.", "It was a bipartisan commission, a study by two respected economists, which indicated that we could collect some 40, 45, 50 billion dollars of those funds.", "The point is you've got to have a president who's prepared to do this and to begin right away and, preferably, a president who was a governor of a state that's had very, very successful experience at doing this.", "In my own state, we did it.", "In other states, we've done it.", "Republican governors as well as Democratic governors.", "And we've had great success at revenue enforcement.", "Now, the Vice President will probably tell you that it's going to take an army of IRS collectors again.", "Well, his campaign manager, who used to be the secretary of the treasury, was taking great credit about a year ago and asking and receiving from the Congress substantial additional funds to hire internal revenue agents to go out and collect these funds, and I'm happy to join Jim Baker in saying that we agree on this.", "But, the fact of the matter is that this is something that we must begin it's going to take at least the first year of the new administration.", "But, the Dorgan Task Force, the bipartisan task force estimated that we could collect about $35 billion in the fifth year, $105 billion over five years, the other study even more than that", " and that's where you begin.", "And what we have to do is restrain the growth of spending.", "And we are doing a better job of it.", "The Congress is doing a better job of it.", "And the dynamics work.", "But they don't work if you go raise taxes and then the Congress spends it continues to spend that.", "The American working man and woman are not taxed too little.", "The Federal Government continues to spend too much.", " More so you than me.", " No, but you got to go back to what social security was when it was created.", "It wasn't created as a welfare program.", "It wasn't created that is it was created as a whole retirement or supplement to retirement program.", "So, here's what's happened.", "We came into office and the Social Security Trust Fund was in great jeopardy and the President took the leadership working with the Democrats and the Republicans in Congress some tough calls were made and the Social Security Trust Fund was put back into sound, solvent condition.", "So, I don't want to fool around with it.", "It always works that way.", "I've seen it.", "In precinct politics in Texas and I've seen it at the national level.", "We have made the Social Security Trust Fund sound.", "And I will not go in there and suggest changes in Social Security.", "He supported it at the National Governors Conference and I supported it in breaking a tie in a major compromise package and we got assailed by the Democrats in the election over that.", "We do not have to do it.", " Andrea, I don't know which George Bush I'm listening to.", "George Bush, a few years ago, said that Social Security was basically a welfare system.", " And in 1985, he flew back from the West Coast to cut that COLA.", "I voted against that at the National Governors Association.", "We won a majority, we didn't win the two-thirds that was necessary nor to pass that resolution, George.", "But everybody knew what we were doing and I've opposed that.", "You did it in 1985.", "The Administration tried to do it repeatedly, repeatedly in 81 82.", "And I'm sure you'll try to do it again.", "Because there's no way you can finance what you want to spend.", "There's no way you can pay for that five year, $40 billion tax cut for the rich and still buy all those weapons systems you want to buy unless you raid the Social Security Trust Fund.", " One I don't have a list yet.", "I feel pretty confident tonight, but not that confident.", " Secondly, I don't have any litmus test.", "But what I would do is appoint people to the Federal Bench that will not legislate from the Bench, who will interpret the Constitution.", "I do not want to see us go to again and Fm using this word advisedly a liberal majority that is going to legislate from the Bench.", "They don't like the use of the word, but may I remind his strong supporters that only last year in the primary, to capture that Democratic nomination, he said, \"I am a progressive liberal Democrat.\"", "I won't support judges like that.", "There is no litmus test on any issue.", "But I will go out there and find men and women to interpret.", "And I don't have a list, but I think the appointments that the President has made to the Bench have been outstanding, outstanding appointments.", "I supported him.", " If the Vice President of the United States thinks that Robert Bork was an outstanding appointment (Cheers and Applause)", " that is a very good reason for voting for Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen on the 8th of November.", " And I think the Vice President supported the Bork nomination.", "You know, Mr. Bush has never appointed a judge.", "I don't ask people whether they're Republicans or Democrats.", "I've appointed prosecutors, I've appointed defenders.", "I don't appoint people I think are liberal or people who think - who I think are conservative.", "I appoint people of independence and integrity and intelligence, people who will be a credit to the Bench.", "And those are the standards that I will use in nominating people to the Supreme Court of the United States.", "Now, two-thirds of the people in this country who receive Social Security checks live entirely on that check; they have no other income.", "And yet Mr. Bush tried to cut their cost of living increase in 1985.", "Medicare is not getting less expensive; medical care for the elderly is getting more expensive, with greater deductibles, with fewer benefits, the kinds of things we've had under this Administration that have cut and chopped and reduced the kind of benefits that one gets under Medicare.", "Yes, we now have catastrophic health insurance, but it's going to cost, and that's going to be an additional burden on elderly citizens.", "It had bipartisan support; it should have had bipartisan support.", "But I suggest that we understand that those are going to be additional costs on senior citizens across this country.",

millions of welfare families to get off of welfare, and I'm proud to say that we finally have a welfare reform bill And the Ruby Samsons and Dan Lawsons, hundreds of thousands of welfare mothers in this country and in my state and across the country who today are working and earning are examples of what can happen when you provide training to those welfare mothers, some daycare for their children so that those mothers can go into a training program and get a decent job.", " That's the way you bring a deficit down and help to improve the quality of life for people at the same time.", "And I voted the same way that he did three months before in a national governors' conference.", "And he said at that time, in a quote, and this is a paraphrase, a freeze, that's easy.", "So I don't believe that we need to do what you've suggested here.", "And I've said that I'm going to keep this Social Security entitlement, to keep that trust fund sound.", "But I do think there are flexible ways to solve some of the pressing problems, particularly that affect our children.", "And I have made some good sound proposals.", "But again, we have a big difference on child care, for example.",

can't do this any more.", "We're going to tell you how to do it all.", "You ought to go out and see around this country what's happening in the volunteer section: Americans helping America.", "And I want to keep it alive in child care and in other entitlements.", " That is absolutely not true.", " That is absolutely not true.", "It had nothing to do with the debate on Social Security.", "It had to do with the discussion we had had the previous day on the overall question of reducing the budget.", "That simply isn't true.", "Now, we're not a parliamentary body, the National Governors Association.", "We vote on resolutions.", "If you don't get a two-thirds, then your resolution doesn't pass.", "But everybody knew that those of us who voted against the freezing of COLAs did so, we did so emphatically.", "And I never made that statement; never would.", "The point is that as we look at this nation's future, and we have two very different visions of this future.", "I want to move ahead.", "The Vice President talks about a thousand points of light.", "I'm interested in 240 million points of light.", "I'm interested in 240 million citizens in this country who share in the American dream, all of them in every part of this country.", "The Vice President did call Social Security a few years ago basically or largely a welfare program.", "It isn't.", "It's a contract between generations.", "It's something that we pay into now so that we will have a secure retirement, and our parents and grandparents will have a secure retirement.", "It's a very sacred contract, and I believe in it.", "So that's not where we ought to go.", "There are plenty of places to cut.", "There's lots we can do in the Pentagon where dishonest contractors have been lining their pockets at the expense of the American taxpayer.", "There are we certainly ought to be able to", "That's where we ought to go, and those are the programs we ought to review first.", "He favors this supply maintenance or production controls.", "He's been out in the state saying that, in Midwestern states.", "I don't.", "I think the farm bill that he criticizes was good legislation, outstanding legislation.", "And I believe the answer to the agricultural economy is not to get the government further involved, but to do what I'm suggesting.", "In the first place, never go back to that

clean water.", "But what I'm not for what I'm not for is measuring it the way that the Democratic Congress does.", "We sent up a good bill on clean water, a sound bill on clean water.", "But the only way you can express your love for clean water is to double the appropriations for clean water, and then rant against the deficit.", "I am for clean water.", "I've been an outdoorsman and a sportsman all my life.", "I've been to these national parks.", "I led for the Earl Wallop bill or formerly Dingell-Johnson.", "I headed the task force when I was a member of the Congress way back in the late '60s on these kinds of things, on the Republican side.", "I led for that.", "And so I refuse to measure one's commitment as to whether you're going to double the spending.", "That is the same old argument that's gotten us into trouble on the deficit side.", "I'm not going to go down there and try to dump the sludge from Massachusetts off the beaches off of New Jersey.", "I'm not going to do that.", "But I'm not going to do that.", "I'm an environmentalist.", "I believe in our parks.", "I believe in the President's commission on outdoors.", "Secondly, if you were so opposed to the grain embargo, why did you ask the godfather of the grain embargo to be one of your top foreign policy advisers?", "I'm also against the pipeline embargo, which you folks attempted to impose.", "Margaret, once again, I don't know which George Bush I'm talking about here or looking at.", "The George Bush who was the charter member of the environmental wrecking crew that went to Washington in the early '80s and did a job on the EPA, or the one we've been seeing and listening to the past two or three months.", "But let me say this, because he spent millions and millions of dollars of advertising on the subject of Boston Harbor.", "George, Boston Harbor was polluted for 100 years.", "I'm the first governor to clean it up.", "No thanks to you.", "We've been cleaning it up for four years.", "We

agricultural issues, about seven stops.", "We had some fun Crystal Gayle and Loretta Lynn with us, and they got up and sang, went to little towns and I talked agriculture.", "And not one thing did I see, with respect, on your network about my views on agriculture, and not one did I read in any newspaper.", "Because you are so interested in a poll that might have been coming out, or because

have differences about how to achieve them.", "I want to move forward, I want this nation to move forward.", "I am concerned about the fact that 10 percent of our manufacturing and 20 percent of our banking and nearly half of the real estate in the city of Los Angeles are in the hands of foreign investors.", "I am concerned about what that does to our future.", " I think we ought to be looking at modernization, I think we ought to be exploring less expensive ways to get it on land, and we ought to make sure that we have an effective and strong and credible nuclear deterrent.", "But we also

spending and the level of defense appropriations which the Congress has now approved and the president has signed, there's no way that you can do all of these things and do them well.", "That's why

business for a long time.", "Pay $1 an hour for your labor, have no health care -- that's the most expensive single element in making the car.", "Have no environmental controls, no pollution controls and no retirement.", "And you don't care about anything but making money.", "There will be a job-sucking sound going south.", "If the people send me to Washington the first thing I'll do is study that 2000-page agreement and make sure it's a 2-way street.", "And that is when their jobs come up from a dollar an hour to $6 an hour, and ours go down to $6 an hour; then it's leveled again, but in the meantime you've wrecked the country with these kind of deals.", "We got to cut it out.", " Carole, the thing that saved us in this global economic slowdown has been our exports, and what I'm trying to do is increase our exports.", "And if indeed all the jobs were going to move south because there are lower wages, there are lower wages now and they haven't done that.", "And the way to do that is to increase our exports.", "Some believe in protection.", "I want to continue to work after we get this NAFTA agreement ratified this coming year.", "I want to get one with Eastern Europe; I want to get one with Chile.", "And free and fair trade is the answer, not protection.", " I'd like to answer the question, because I've actually been a governor for 12 years, so I've known a lot of people who have lost their jobs because of jobs moving overseas, and I know a lot of people whose plants have been strengthened by increasing exports.", "The trick is to expand our export base and to expand trade on terms that are fair to us.", "It is true that our exports to Mexico, for example, have gone up and our trade deficit has gone down; it's also true that just today a record high trade deficit was announced with Japan.", "Number one, make sure that other countries are as open to our markets as our markets are to them, and, if they're not, have measures on the books that don't take forever and a day to implement.", "There are more deductions in the tax code for shutting plants down and moving overseas than there are for modernizing plant and equipment here.", "Our competitors don't do that.", "Emphasize and subsidize modernizing plant and equipment here, not moving plants overseas.", "Number three, stop the federal government's program that now gives low-interest loans and job training funds to companies that will actually shut down and move to other countries, but we won't do the same thing for plants that stay here.", "So more trade but on fair terms -- and favor investment in America.", "Because the deficit now has been building up for 12 years.", "I think we can bring it down by 50% in 4 years and grow the economy.", "I ask everybody to look at my economic ideas and 9 Nobel prize winners and over 500 economists and hundreds of business people, including a lot of Republicans said, this is the way you've got to go.", "If you don't grow the economy you can't get it done.", " Well, I'm a little confused here, because I don't see how you can grow the deficit down by raising people's taxes.", "You see, I don't think the American people are taxed too little.", "I think they're taxed too much.", "I went for one tax increase and when I make a mistake I admit it.", "I said that wasn't the right thing to do.", "Governor Clinton's program wants to tax more and spend more -- $150 billion in new taxes, spend another $220.", "I don't believe that's the way to do it.", "And I think it would discipline not only the Congress, which needs it, but also the executive branch.", "I'd like to have what 43 governors have -- the line item veto, so if the Congress can't cut, and we've got a reckless spending Congress, let the president have a shot at it by wiping out things that are pork barrel or something of that nature.", "I've proposed another one.", "Some sophisticates think it may be a little gimmicky.", "I think it's good.", "You can check 10% of that if you want to, in the 1 box, and that 10%, $100, or if you're paying $10,000, whatever it is, $1000, check it off and make the government, make it lower the deficit by that amount.", "And if the Congress won't do it, if they can't get together and negotiate how to do that, then you'd have a sequester across the board.", "You'd exempt Social Security -- I don't want to tax or touch Social Security.", "I'm the president that said hey, don't mess with Social Security, and we haven't.", "So I believe that we need to control the growth of mandatory spending, back to this gentleman's question.", "That's the main growing thing in the budget.", "The program that the president -- two-thirds of the budget, I as president never get to look at, never get to touch.", "We've got to control that growth to inflation and population increase, but not raise taxes on the American people now.", "I just don't believe that would stimulate any kind of growth at all.", " Well, we're $4 trillion in debt.", "We're going into debt an additional $1 billion, little more than $1 billion every working day of the year.", "The American people asked me to get into it.", "But I just find it fascinating that while we sit here tonight we will go into debt an additional $50 million in an hour and a half.", "Now, it's not the Republicans' fault, of course, and it's not the Democrats' fault.", "I'm here tonight for these young people up here in the balcony from this college.", "When I was a young man, when I got out of the Navy I had multiple job offers.", "Young people with high grades can't get a job.", "In other words, we were down to 18% of them were making -- 18- to 24-year- olds were making less than $12,000.", "The dollar's gone through the floor.", "Now, whose fault is that?", "Not the Democrats.", "Not the Republicans.", "Somewhere out there there's an extraterrestrial that's doing this to us, I guess.", "And everybody says they take responsibility.", "We'll down our debt.", "We'll pass on the American dream to our children, and I will not leave our children a situation that they have today.", "When I was a boy it took 2 generations to double the standard of living.", "Today it will take 12 generations.", "As you all know, I've been buying 30-minute segments to talk about issues.", "And tomorrow night on NBC, from 10:30 to 11 Eastern, we're going to talk about how you pay the debt down, so we're going to come right down to that one.", "And I have said again and again and again let's get off mud wrestling, let's get off personalities and let's talk about jobs, health care, crime, the things that concern the American people.", "I'm spending my money -- not PAC money, not foreign money, my money -- to take this message to the people.", "I think you have to look at it.", "I think that has to be a part of a candidate for president or being president.", "In terms of programs, I've submitted, what, 4 different budgets to the US Congress in great detail.", "And everything in there says what I am for.", "Now I've come out with a new agenda for America's renewal, a plan that I believe really will help stimulate the growth of this economy.", "But character is an important part of the equation.", "The other night Governor Clinton raised my -- I don't know if you saw the debate the other night.", "I'm thinking of Ross Perot's running mate sitting in the jail.", "And I do think that you can't turn the White House into the Waffle House.", " Let me say first of all to you that I believe so strongly in the question you asked that I suggested this format tonight.", "I also had a program starting last year.", "I've been disturbed by the tone and the tenor of this campaign.", "Mr. Bush said once again I was going to have $150 billion tax increase.", "When Mr. Quayle said that all the networks said, that's not true.", "He's got over $100 billion of tax cuts and incentives.", "So I'm not going to take up your time tonight, but let me just say this.", "But the Washington Post ran a long editorial today saying they couldn't believe Mr. Bush was making character an issue and they said he was the greatest quote \"political chameleon\" for changing his positions of all times.", "Let's don't -- you don't have to believe it.", "And I'm interested in what we can trust him to do and what you can trust me to do and what you can trust Mr. Perot to do for the next 4 years.", " I think it depends how you define it.", "Standing up against aggression.", "That's not specific in terms of a program.", "This is what a president has to do.", "So in principle, though, I'll take your point and think we ought to discuss child care or whatever else it is.", "So I'll take the pledge and will stay on the issues.", "I make those charts you see on television.", "But you don't have to wonder if it's me talking.", "The ideas I express are mine.", "So I don't want the implication to be that somehow everything we say is just cooked up and put in our head by somebody else.", "I worked 12 years very hard as a governor on the real problems of real people.", "I'm just as sick as you are by having to wake up and figure out how to defend myself every day.", "I never thought I'd ever be involved in anything like this.", " And I don't have any foreign money in my campaign.", "I don't have any foreign lobbyists on leave in my campaign.", "I don't have any PAC money in my campaign.", "And they're interested in what you're interested in.", "I take the pledge.", "I've already taken the pledge on cutting the deficit in half.",

year the most furthest looking transportation bill in the history of this country since Eisenhower started the interstate highways -- $150 billion for improving the infrastructure.", "That happened when I was president.", "And so I'm very proud of the way that came about and I think it's a very, very good beginning.", "We hear all the negatives.", "When you're president you expect this.",

for having people own their own homes instead of living in these deadly tenements.", "Our enterprise zones, that we hear a lot of lip service about in Congress, would bring jobs into the inner city.",

difficult to get it through the Congress.", "But there's going to be a new Congress.", "No one likes gridlock.", "You're going to have a lot of new members of Congress.", "And then you can sit down and say, help me do what we should for the cities.", "Help me pass these programs.", "That's the problem with our system.", "If you had a line item veto you could knock out the pork.", "You could knock out the tax increases and you could do what the people want, and that's create enterprise zones.", " That bill pays for these urban enterprise zones by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more.", "And that's why he wants to veto it, just like he vetoed an earlier bill this year.", "This is not mud slinging.", "This is facts -- that would have given investment tax credits and other incentives to reinvest in our cities, in our country.", "But it asked the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more.", "Mr. Perot wants to do the same thing.", "I agree with him.", "My plan

have money to pay for these things.", "So you've got to create jobs.", "There are all kinds of ways to create jobs in the inner city.", "I talk to the Republican leaders and they want it.", "But since they're bred from childhood to fight with one another rather than get results, you know, I would be glad to drop out and spend a little time and see if we couldn't build some bridges.", "Now, results is what counts.", "The president can't order Congress around.", "Congress can't order the president around.", "But you have to work together.", "Now, I have talked to the chairmen of the committees that want this.", "They're Democrats.", "We didn't fund a lot of other things this year, like the savings and loan mess.", "That's another story that we're going to pay a big price for right after the election.", "The facts are though -- the facts are -- the American people are hurting.", "These people are hurting in the inner cities.", "We're shipping the quote, \"low paying jobs\" overseas.",

work, I'll cut grass tomorrow to take care of my family; I'll be happy to make shoes, I'll be happy to make clothing, I'll make sausage.", "You just give me a job.", "Put those jobs in the inner cities instead of doing diplomatic deals and shipping them to China where prison labor does the work.", " If you ask me if I could fly a fighter plane or be an astronaut, I can't.", "I've spent my life creating jobs.", "That's something I know how to do.", "And, among other things, I would say, okay, over here in this Senate committee to the chairman who is anxious to get this bill passed, the president who is anxious, I'd say rather than just yelling at one another, why don't we find out where we're apart, try to get together, get the bill passed and give the people the benefits and not play party politics right now.", "And I think the press would follow that so closely that probably they would get it done.", "That's the way I would do it.", " I support the right to keep and bear arms.", "I live in a state where over half the adults have hunting or fishing licenses, or both.", "But I believe we have to have some way of checking hand guns before they're sold, to check the criminal history, the mental health history, and the age of people who are buying them.", "Therefore I support the Brady bill which would impose a national waiting period unless and until a state did what only Virginia has done now, which is to automate its records.", "Once you automate your records, then you don't have to have a waiting period, but at least you can check.", "I also think we should have frankly restrictions on assault weapons whose only purpose is to kill.", "We need to give the police a fighting chance in our urban areas where the gangs are building up.", "I also believe that we should offer college scholarships to people who will agree to work them off as police officers, and I think, as we reduce our military forces, we should let people earn military retirement by coming out and working as police officers.", "In the communities which have had real success putting police officers near schools where kids carry weapons, to get the weapons out of the schools, are on the same blocks, you've seen crime go down.", " I think you put your finger on a major problem.", "I talk about strengthening the American family and it's very hard to strengthen the family if people are scared to walk down to the corner store and, you know, send their kid down to get a loaf of bread.", "It's very hard.", "I have been fighting for very strong anti-crime legislation -- habeas corpus reform, so you don't have these endless appeals, so when somebody gets sentenced, hey, this is for real.", "Virginia's in the lead in this, as Governor Clinton properly said, on this identification system for firearms.", "I am not for national registration of firearms.", "Some of the states that have the toughest anti-gun laws have the highest levels of crime.", "We've got more money going out for local police than any previous administration.", "So we've got to get it under control and there's one last point I'd make.", "We have got to win our national strategy against drugs, the fight against drugs.", "And we're making some progress, doing a little better on interdiction.", "We're not doing as well amongst the people that get to be habitual drug-users.", "The good news is, and I think it's true in Richmond, teenage use is down of cocaine, substantially, 60% in the last couple of years.", "So we're making progress but until we get that one done, we're not going to solve the neighborhood crime problem.", " On any program, and this includes crime, you'll find we have all kinds of great plans lying around that never get enacted into law and implemented.", "I don't care what it is -- competitiveness, health care, crime, you name it.", "Brady Bill, I agree that it's a timid step in the right direction but it won't fix it.", "So why pass a law that won't fix it?", "Now, what it really boils down to is can you live -- we become so preoccupied with the rights of the criminal that we've forgotten the rights of the innocent.", "That's where we are.", "We have got to become more concerned about people who play by the rules and get the balance we require.", "This is going to take first, building a consensus at grassroots America.", "Right from the bottom up, the American people have got to say they want it.", "And at that point, we can pick from a variety of plans and develop new plans.", "And the way you get things done is bury yourselves in the room with one another, put together the best program, take it to the American people, use the electronic town hall, the kind of thing you're doing here tonight, build a consensus and then do it and then go on to the next one.", "But don't just sit here slow dancing for 4 years doing nothing.", " I strongly support term limits for members of the US Congress.", "The president's terms are limited to 2, a total of 8 years.", "What's wrong with limiting the terms of members of Congress to 12?", "Congress has gotten kind of institutionalized.", "For 38 years one party has controlled the House of Representatives, and the result, a sorry little post office that can't do anything right and a bank that has more overdrafts than all the Chase Bank and Citibank put together.", "And I think you get a certain arrogance, bureaucratic arrogance, if people stay there too long.", "And so I favor, strongly favor, term limits.", "And how to get them passed?", "Send us some people that will pass the idea.", "And I think you will.", "I think the American people want it now.", "Every place I go I talk about it, and I think they want it done.", "I believe, number one, it would pose a real problem for a lot of smaller states in the Congress who have enough trouble now making sure their interests are heard.", "Number 2, I think it would increase the influence of unelected staff members in the Congress who have too much influence already.", "Number 3, if the people really have a mind to change, they can.", "You're going to have 120 to 150 new members of Congress.", "I favor strict controls on how much you can spend running for Congress, strict limits on political action committees, requirements that people running for Congress appear in open public debates like we're doing now.", "So that's how I feel about it, and I think if we had the right kind of campaign reform, we'd get the changes you want.", "If the American people send me up to do this job, I intend to be there one term.", "I do not intend to spend one minute of one day thinking about re-election.", "But we have got to reform government.", "If you put term limits in and don't reform government, you won't get the benefits you thought.", "So we need to do the reforms and the term limits.", "And after we reform it, it won't be a lifetime career opportunity; good people will go serve and then go back to their homes and not become foreign lobbyists and cash in at 30,000 bucks a month and then take time off to run some president's campaign.", "They're all nice people, they're just in a bad system.", "I don't think there are any villains, but, boy, is the system rotten.", " I've had more people talk to me about their health care problems I guess than anything else, all across America -- you know, people who've lost their jobs, lost their businesses, had to give up their jobs because of sick children.", "We spend 30% more of our income than any nation on earth on health care, and yet we insure fewer people.", "We have 35 million people without any insurance at all -- and I see them all the time.", "A hundred thousand Americans a month have lost their health insurance just in the last 4 years.", "So if you analyze where we're out of line with other countries, you come up with the following conclusions.", "Number one, we spend at least $60 billion a year on insurance, administrative cost, bureaucracy, and government regulation that wouldn't be spent in any other nation.", "So we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everybody.", "Employers would cover their employees, government would cover the unemployed.", "Number 2, I think you have to take on specifically the insurance companies and require them to make some significant change in the way they rate people in the big community pools.", "I think you have to tell the pharmaceutical companies they can't keep raising drug prices at three times the rate of inflation.", "I think you have to take on medical fraud.", "I think you have to help doctors stop practicing defensive medicine.", "I've recommended that our doctors be given a set of national practice guidelines and that if they follow those guidelines that raises the presumption that they didn't do anything wrong.", "I think you have to have a system of primary and preventive clinics in our inner cities and our rural areas so people can have access to health care.", "The key is to control the cost and maintain the quality.", "To do that you need a system of managed competition where all of us are covered in big groups and we can choose our doctors and our hospitals, a wide range, but there is an incentive to control costs.", "And I think there has to be -- I think Mr. Perot and I agree on this, there has to be a national commission of health care providers and health care consumers that set ceilings to keep health costs in line with inflation, plus population growth.", "They cover 98% of their people and their insurance premiums are much cheaper than the rest of America, and so does Rochester, New York.", "They now have a plan to cover everybody and their premiums are two-thirds of the rest of the country.", "It's terribly important.", "Ross was very articulate across the country.", "I don't want anybody to stampede to cut the president's salary off altogether.", "Barbara's sitting over here and I -- but what I have proposed, 10% cut, downsize the government, and we can get that done.", "She asked a question, I think, is whether the health care profession was to blame.", "No.", "One thing to blame is these malpractice lawsuits.", "They're breaking the system.", "So you can't blame the practitioners for the health problem.", "And my program is this.", "Keep the government as far out of it as possible, make insurance available to the poorest of the poor, through vouchers, next range in the income bracket, through tax credits, and get on about the business of pooling insurance.", "He can buy insurance cheaper than Mom and Pop's store on the corner.", "But if those Mom and Pop stores all get together and pool, they too can bring the cost of insurance down.", "So I want to keep the quality of health care.", "That means keep government out of it.", "I want to do -- I don't like this idea of these boards.", "It all sounds to me like you're going to have some government setting price.", "I want competition and I want to pool the insurance and take care of it that way and have -- oh, here's the other point.", "I think medical care should go with the person.", "If you leave a business, I think your insurance should go with you to some other business.", "I think it's a good program.", " We have the most expensive health care system in the world.", "Twelve percent of our gross national product goes to health care.", "Our industrial competitors, who are beating us in competition, spend less and have better health care.", "Japan spends a little over 6% of its gross national product.", "Germany spends 8%.", "You've bought a front row box seat and you're not happy with your health care and you're saying tonight we've got bad health care but very expensive health care.", "And as a private citizen, believe me, you are looked on as a major nuisance.", "You're supposed to have a government that comes from you.", "Now, there are all kinds of good ideas, brilliant ideas, terrific ideas on health care.", "A senator runs every 6 years.", "He's got to raise 20,000 bucks a week to have enough money to run.", "Who's he gonna listen to -- us or the folks running up and down the aisles with money, the lobbyists, the PAC money?", "He listens to them.", "Who do they represent?", "Health care industry.", "Not us.", "Now, you've got to have a government that comes from you again.", "You've got to reassert your ownership in this country and you've got to completely reform our government.", "I think we ought to do plastic surgery on a lot of these guys so that they're all ears, too, and listen to you.", "Then you get what you want, and shouldn't you?", "You paid for it.", "Why shouldn't you get what you want, as opposed to what some lobbyist cuts a deal, writes a little piece in the law and he goes through.", "That's the way the game's played now.", "Till you change it you're gonna be unhappy.", "We have elections so people can make decisions about this.", "The point I want to make to you is, a bipartisan commission reviewed my plan and the Bush plan and there were as many Republicans as Democratic health care experts on it.", "They concluded that my plan would cover everybody and his would leave 27 million behind by the year 2000 and that my plan in the next 12 years would save $2.2 trillion in public and private money to reinvest in this economy and the average family would save $1200 a year under the plan that I offered without any erosion in the quality of health care.", "So I ask you to look at that.", "And you have to vote for somebody with a plan.", "That's what you have elections for.", "If people would say, well, he got elected to do this and then the Congress says, okay, I'm going to do it.", "That's what the election was about."]
