["And, after 9/11, it became clear that we had to do several things to have a successful strategy to win the global war on terror, specifically that we had to go after the terrorists wherever we might find them, that we also had to go after state sponsors of terror, those who might provide sanctuary or safe harbor for terror.", "What we did in Iraq was exactly the right thing to do.", "If I had it to recommend all over again, I would recommend exactly the same course of action.", "And we did exactly the right thing.", "Mr. Vice President, you are still not being straight with the American people.", "I mean, the reality you and George Bush continue to tell people, first, that things are going well in Iraq -- the American people don't need us to explain this to them, they see it on their television every single day.", "We lost more troops in September than we lost in August; lost more in August than we lost in July; lost more in July than we lost in June.", "The truth is, our men and women in uniform have been heroic.", "Our military has done everything they've been asked to do.", "And it's not just me that sees the mess in Iraq.", "There are Republican leaders, like John McCain, like Richard Lugar, like Chuck Hagel, who have said Iraq is a mess and it's getting worse.", "And when they were asked why, Richard Lugar said because of the incompetence of the administration.", "What Paul Bremer said yesterday is they didn't have enough troops to secure the country.", "They also didn't have a plan to win the peace.", "They also didn't put the alliances together to make this successful.", "We need a fresh start.", "We need a president who will speed up the training of the Iraqis, get more staff in for doing that.", "We need to speed up the reconstruction so the Iraqis see some tangible benefit.", "We need a new president who has the credibility, which John Kerry has, to bring others into this effort.", " We've made significant progress in Iraq.", "We've stood up a new government that's been in power now only 90 days.", "They will have free elections next January for the first time in history.", "We also are actively, rapidly training Iraqis to take on the security responsibility.", "Those two steps are crucial to success in Iraq.", "They're well in hand, well under way.", "Mr. Vice President, there is no connection between the attacks of September 11th and Saddam Hussein.", "The 9/11 Commission has said it.", "Your own secretary of state has said it.", "And you've gone around the country suggesting that there is some connection.", "There is not.", "And in fact the CIA is now about to report that the connection between Al Qaida and Saddam Hussein is tenuous at best.", "And, in fact, the secretary of defense said yesterday that he knows of no hard evidence of the connection.", "We need to be straight with the American people.", "John Kerry and I have consistently said that.", "That's why we voted for the resolution.", "But it also means it needed to be done the right way.", "And doing it the right way meant that we were prepared; that we gave the weapons inspectors time to find out what we now know, that in fact there were no weapons of mass destruction; that we didn't take our eye off the ball, which are Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, the people who attacked us on September the 11th.", "That was the right decision.", "And our military performed terrifically there.", "But we had Osama bin Laden cornered at Tora Bora.", "We had the 10th Mountain Division up in Uzbekistan available.", "We had the finest military in the world on the ground.", "And what did we do?", "We turned -- this is the man who masterminded the greatest mass murder and terrorist attack in American history.", "And what did the administration decide to do?", "Our point in this is not complicated: We were attacked by Al Qaida and Osama bin Laden.", "We went into Afghanistan and very quickly the administration made a decision to divert attention from that and instead began to plan for the invasion of Iraq.", "Because there is no connection between Saddam Hussein and the attacks of September 11th -- period.", "The 9/11 Commission has said that's true.", "Colin Powell has said it's true.", "But the vice president keeps suggesting that there is.", "There is not.", "And, in fact, any connection with Al Qaida is tenuous at best.", " The senator has got his facts wrong.", "I have not suggested there's a connection between Iraq and 9/11, but there's clearly an established Iraqi track record with terror.", "They've got a very limited view about how to use U.S. military forces to defend America.", "We heard Senator Kerry say the other night that there ought to be some kind of global test before U.S. troops are deployed preemptively to protect the United States.", "Then, in the mid-'80s, he ran on the basis of cutting most of our major defense programs.", "In 1991, he voted against Desert Storm.", "It's a consistent pattern over time of always being on the wrong side of defense issues.", "And they give absolutely no indication, based on that record, of being wiling to go forward and aggressively pursue the war on terror with a kind of strategy that will work, that will defeat our enemies and will guarantee that the United States doesn't again get attacked by the likes of Al Qaida.", " Gwen, we've never let up on Osama bin Laden from day one.", "We've actively and aggressively pursued him.", "We've captured or killed thousands of Al Qaida in various places around the world and especially in Afghanistan.", "We'll continue to very aggressively pursue him, and I'm confident eventually we'll get him.", "We've got 10 million voters who have registered to vote, nearly half of them women.", "That election will put in place a democratically elected government that will take over next December.", "The fact is, as we go forward in Afghanistan, we will pursue Osama bin Laden and the terrorists as long as necessary.", "We're standing up Afghan security forces so they can take on responsibility for their own security.", "We'll keep U.S. forces there -- we have about 16,000 there today -- as long as necessary, to assist the Afghans in terms of dealing with their security situation.", "But they're making significant progress.", "We have President Karzai, who is in power.", "They have done wonders writing their own constitution for the first time ever.", "Schools are open.", "Young girls are going to school.", "Women are going to vote.", "Women are even eligible to run for office.", "This is major, major progress.", "There will be democracy in Afghanistan, make no doubt about it.", "Freedom is the best antidote to terror.", " Someone did get it wrong.", "But it wasn't John Kerry and John Edwards.", "They got it wrong.", "When we had Osama bin Laden cornered, they left the job to the Afghan warlords.", "They then diverted their attention from the very people who attacked us, who were at the center of the war on terror, and so Osama bin Laden is still at large.", "We will keep this country safe.", "He also said very clearly that he will never give any country veto power over the security of the United States of America.", "What's actually happened is they're now providing 75 percent of the world's opium.", "Big parts of the country are still insecure.", "And the reality is the part of Afghanistan, eastern Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is, is one of the hardest places to control and the most insecure, Gwen.", " Twenty years ago we had a similar situation in El Salvador.", "We had -- guerrilla insurgency controlled roughly a third of the country, 75,000 people dead, and we held free elections.", "The human drive for freedom, the determination of these people to vote, was unbelievable.", "The power of that concept is enormous.", "And it will apply in Afghanistan, and it will apply as well in Iraq.", " The vice president just said that we should focus on state sponsors of terrorism.", "Iran has moved forward with its nuclear weapons program.", "They're more dangerous today than they were four years ago.", "North Korea has moved forward with their nuclear weapons program, gone from one to two nuclear weapons to six to eight nuclear weapons.", "This vice president has been an advocate for over a decade for lifting sanctions against Iran, the largest state sponsor of terrorism on the planet.", "It's a mistake.", "First, we're going to actually tell the American people the truth.", "We're going to tell them the truth about what's happening.", "We're not going to suggest to them that things are going well in Iraq or anyplace else when, in fact, they're not.", "We're going to make sure that the American people know the truth about why we are using force and what the explanation for it is.", "And it's not just the American people.", "We're also going to make sure that we tell the world the truth.", "Because the reality is, for America to lead, for America to do what it's done for 50 years before this president and vice president came into office, it is critical that we be credible.", "And unfortunately, we're seeing the consequences of that right now.", "It's one of the reasons that we're having so much difficulty getting others involved in the effort in Iraq.", "You know, we've taken 90 percent of the coalition casualties.", "American taxpayers have borne 90 percent of the costs of the effort in Iraq.", "We're at $200 billion and counting.", "John Kerry will never give up control over the security of the United States of America to any other country.", "We will not outsource our responsibility to keep this country safe.", " Well, Gwen, the 90 percent figure is just dead wrong.", "But $120 billion is, in fact, what has been allocated to Iraq.", "The rest of it's for Afghanistan and the global war on terror.", "The allies have stepped forward and agreed to reduce and forgive Iraqi debt to the tune of nearly $80 billion by one estimate.", "That, plus $14 billion they promised in terms of direct aid, puts the overall allied contribution financially at about $95 billion, not to the $120 billion we've got, but, you know, better than 40 percent.", "So your facts are just wrong, Senator.", "Whatever the political pressures of the moment requires, that's where you're at.", "What the vice president has just said is just a complete distortion.", "The American people saw John Kerry on Thursday night.", "They don't need the vice president or the president to tell them what they saw.", "They saw a man who was strong, who had conviction, who is resolute, who made it very clear that he will do everything that has to be done to find terrorists, to keep the American people safe.", " Your rhetoric, Senator, would be a lot more credible if there was a record to back it up.", "There isn't.", "And you cannot use \"talk tough\" during the course of a 90-minute debate in a presidential campaign to obscure a 30-year record in the United States Senate and, prior to that by John Kerry, who has consistently come down on the wrong side of all the major defense issues that he's faced as a public official.", "What we've questioned is his judgment.", "In 1984, when he ran for the Senate he opposed, or called for the elimination of a great many major weapons systems that were crucial to winning the Cold War and are important today to our overall forces.", "When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and occupied it in 1990 and '91, he stood up on the floor of the Senate and voted against going in to liberate Kuwait and push Saddam Hussein back to Iraq.", "The problem we have is that, if you look at his record, he doesn't display the qualities of somebody who has conviction.", "And with respect to this particular operation, we've seen a situation in which, first, they voted to commit the troops, to send them to war, John Edwards and John Kerry, then they came back and when the question was whether or not you provide them with the resources they needed -- body armor, spare parts, ammunition -- they voted against it.", "And then I looked and figured out that what was happening was Howard Dean was making major progress in the Democratic primaries, running away with the primaries based on an anti-war record.", "So they, in effect, decided they would cast an anti-war vote and they voted against the troops.", "Now if they couldn't stand up to the pressures that Howard Dean represented, how can we expect them to stand up to Al Qaida?", "I mean, we've seen over and over and over the misjudgments made by this administration.", "I want to go back to what the vice president just said, because it's a continuation of the things he's been doing, unfortunately, on the campaign trail; it's a continuation of what he began his first answer with tonight.", "John Kerry has voted for the biggest military appropriations bill in the country's history.", "John Kerry has voted for the biggest intelligence appropriations in the country's history.", "This vice president, when he was secretary of defense, cut over 80 weapons systems, including the very ones he's criticizing John Kerry for voting against.", "These are weapons systems, a big chunk of which, the vice president himself suggested we get rid of after the Cold War.", "The reality is that John Kerry has consistently supported the very men that he served with in Vietnam and led.", "On the $87 billion, it was clear at the time of that vote that they had no plan to win the peace.", "We're seeing the consequences of that everyday on the ground right now.", "We stood up and said: For our troops, we must have a plan to win the peace.", "We also thought it was wrong to have a $20 billion fund out of which $7.5 billion was going to go to a no-bid contract for Halliburton, the vice president's former company.", "It was wrong then.", "It's wrong now.", "These are two individuals who have been for the war when the headlines were good and against it when their poll ratings were bad.", "We have not seen the kind of consistency that a commander in chief has to have in order to be a leader in wartime and in order to be able to see the strategy through to victory.", "If we want to win the war on terror, it seems to me it's pretty clear the choice is George Bush, not John Kerry.", " John Kerry has been absolutely clear and consistent from the beginning that we must stay focused on the people who attacked us; that Saddam Hussein was a threat that needed to be addressed directly; that the weapons inspectors needed to have time to do their job.", "What we know is that the president and the vice president have not done the work to build the coalition that we need -- dramatically different than the first Gulf War.", "They didn't, by the way, just reject the allies going into lead- up to the war.", "They also rejected them in the effort to do the reconstruction in Iraq, and that has consequences.", "What we believe is, as part of our entire plan for Iraq -- and we have a plan for Iraq.", "They have a plan for Iraq too: more of the same.", "We have a plan for success.", "And that plan includes speeding up the training of the military.", "We have less than half of the staff that we need there to complete that training.", "Second, make sure that the reconstruction is sped up in a way that the Iraqis see some tangible benefit for what's happening.", "We can take them out of Iraq for purposes of training.", "We should do whatever has to be done to train the Iraqis and to speed up that process.", "Right now, the United Nations, which is responsible for the elections in January, has about 35 people there.", "Now, that's compared with a much smaller country like East Timor, where they had over 200 people on the ground.", "You need more than 35 people to hold an election in Cleveland, much less in Iraq.", "The reality is we need a new president with credibility with the rest of the world and who has a real plan for success.", "He attacks us about the troops.", "They sent 40,000 American troops into Iraq without the body armor they needed.", "They sent them without the armored vehicles they needed.", "While they were on the ground fighting, they lobbied the Congress to cut their combat pay.", "The fact of the matter is the troops wouldn't have what they have today if you guys had had your way.", "You talk about internationalizing the effort.", "They don't have a plan.", "You made the comment that the Gulf War coalition in '91 was far stronger than this.", "No.", "We had 34 countries then; we've got 30 today.", "We've got troops beside us.", "In effect, you demean the sacrifice of our allies when you say it's the wrong war, wrong place, wrong time, and oh, by the way, send troops.", "It's totally inconsistent.", "There isn't a plan there.", "Our most important ally in the war on terror, in Iraq specifically, is Prime Minister Allawi.", "That is not the way to win friends and allies.", "You're never going to add to the coalition with that kind of attitude.", "The vice president suggests that we have the same number of countries involved now that we had in the first Gulf War.", "The first Gulf War cost the American people $5 billion.", "Ninety percent of the cost of this effort are being borne by American taxpayers.", "It is the direct result of the failures of this administration.", "He won't count the sacrifice and the contribution of Iraqi allies.", "They're in the fight.", "They're increasingly the ones out there putting their necks on the line to take back their country from the terrorists and the old regime elements that are still left.", "They're doing a superb job.", "You cannot succeed in this effort if you're not willing to recognize the enormous contribution the Iraqis are increasingly making to their own future.", "It's a continuation of, \"Well, there's a strong connection between Al Qaida and Saddam Hussein.\"", "It's not true.", "It's a continuation of at least insinuating that there's some connection between 9/11 and Saddam Hussein.", "If we want to do the things that need to be done to keep this country safe, we can't be dragged kicking and screaming to it.", "One thing that everybody does agree on is that 9/11 did change things.", "But what's happened is this administration opposed the creation of a 9/11 Commission to find out why it happened and what we needed to do.", "They opposed the creation of a Department of Homeland Security, and then they were for it.", "We can't react that way.", "With John Kerry as president of the United States, we are committed to immediately implementing all of the reforms suggested by the 9/11 Commission, so that we have the information we need to find terrorists and crush them before they hurt us.", "We know he was running a terrorist camp, training terrorists in Afghanistan prior to 9/11.", "We know that when we went into Afghanistan that he then migrated to Baghdad.", "We know he's still in Baghdad today.", "He is responsible for most of the major car bombings that have killed or maimed thousands of people.", "The fact of the matter is that this is exactly the kind of track record we've seen over the years.", "We have to deal with Zarqawi by taking him out, and that's exactly what we'll do.", "What happens when we impose unilateral sanctions is, unless there's a collective effort, then other people move in and take advantage of the situation and you don't have any impact, except to penalize American companies.", "We've got sanctions on Iran now.", "We may well want to go to the U.N. Security Council and ask for even tougher sanctions if they don't live up to their obligations under the initial -- International Atomic Energy Agency Non-Proliferation Treaty.", "We're working with the Brits and the Germans and the French, who've been negotiating with the Iranians.", "We recently were actively involved in a meeting with the board of governors in the International Atomic Energy Agency.", "And as I say, there will be a follow-up meeting in November to determine whether or not Iran's living up to their commitments and obligations.", "And if they aren't, my guess is then the board of governors will recommend sending the whole matter to the U.N. Security Council for the application of the international sanctions, which I think would be exactly the right way to go.", "We're addressing North Korea on a similar basis, working with the Chinese, the South Koreans, the Japanese and others to try to bring them around.", "This was one of the biggest sources of proliferation in the world today in terms of the threat that was represented by that.", "The suppliers network that provided that, headed by Mr. A.Q.", "Khan, has been shut down.", "We've made major progress in dealing here with a major issue with respect to nuclear proliferation.", "And we'll continue to press very hard on the North Koreans and the Iranians as well.", "There are 60 countries who have members of Al Qaida in them.", "How many of those countries are we going to invade?", "Not only that, he talks about Iran.", "The reality about Iran is that Iran has moved forward with their nuclear weapons program on their watch.", "They ceded responsibility to dealing with it to the Europeans.", "John Kerry and I believe we need to strengthen the sanctions on Iraq, including closing the loophole that allows companies to use a subsidiary, offshore subsidiaries to do business with Iran.", "I mentioned Halliburton a few minute ago in connection with the $87 billion, and you raised it in this question.", "Here's why we didn't think Halliburton should have a no-bid contract.", "While he was CEO of Halliburton, they paid millions of dollars in fines for providing false information on their company, just like Enron and Ken Lay.", "They did business with Libya and Iran, two sworn enemies of the United States.", "They're now under investigation for having bribed foreign officials during that period of time.", "They know the charges are false.", "They know that if you go, for example, to factcheck.com (sic), an independent Web site sponsored by the University of Pennsylvania, you can get the specific details with respect to Halliburton.", "It's an effort that they've made repeatedly to try to confuse the voters and to raise questions, but there's no substance to the charges.", "First, the Israeli people not only have the right to defend themselves, they should defend themselves.", "They have an obligation to defend themselves.", "It's important for America to participate in helping with that process.", "Now, if Gaza's being used as a platform for attacking the Israeli people, that has to be stopped.", "And Israel has a right to defend itself.", "They don't have a partner for peace right now.", "And I might add, it is very important for America to crack down on the Saudis who have not had a public prosecution for financing terrorism since 9/11.", "And Senator, frankly, you have a record in the Senate that's not very distinguished.", "You've missed 33 out of 36 meetings in the Judiciary Committee, almost 70 percent of the meetings of the Intelligence Committee.", "You've missed a lot of key votes: on tax policy, on energy, on Medicare reform.", "I personally think one of the reasons that we don't have as many suicide attacks today in Israel as we've had in the past is because Saddam is no longer in business.", "We've been strong supporters of Israel.", "But first, there has to be an interlocutor you can trust and deal with.", "And we won't have that, we don't have it now, in a Yasser Arafat.", "There has to be reform of the Palestinian system.", " That was a complete distortion of my record.", "He voted against the Department of Education.", "He voted against funding for Meals on Wheels for seniors.", "He voted against a holiday for Martin Luther King.", "He voted against a resolution calling for the release of Nelson Mandela in South Africa.", " Oh, I think his record speaks for itself.", "And frankly, it's not very distinguished.", " Well, Gwen, there are several things that I think need to be done and are being done.", "We've, of course, been through a difficult recession, and then the aftermath of 9/11, where we lost over a million jobs after that attack.", "But we think the key is to address some basic, fundamental issues that the president's already working on.", "I think probably the most successful thing we can do with respect to ending poverty is to get people jobs.", "There's no better antidote to poverty than a good, well-paying job that allows somebody to take care of their own family.", "To do that, we have to make America the best place in the world to do business.", "And that means we've got to deal effectively with tax policy.", "We've got to reduce the litigation costs that are built into our society.", "We've got to provide the adequate medical care and make certain that we can, in fact, create the opportunities that are vital to that process.", "I think the most important thing we can do is have a first-class public school system.", "I'm a product of public schools.", "And the president, his first legislative priority was the No Child Left Behind Act.", "It establishes high standards.", "It, at the same time, sets up a system of testing with respect to our school system, so we can establish accountability to parents and make certain that they understand how well their students are doing.", "And they have the opportunity to move students out of poorly performing schools to good schools.", "It's working.", "We've seen reports now of a reduction in the achievement gap between majority students and minority students.", "We're making significant progress.", "Here's what's happened: In the time that they have been in office, in the last four years, 1.6 million private sector jobs have been lost, 2.7 million manufacturing jobs have been lost.", "And it's had real consequences in places like Cleveland.", "One out of almost two children in Cleveland are now living in poverty.", "We have to do better.", "We have a plan.", "We're going to get rid of -- by the way, they're for outsourcing jobs.", "I want to make sure people hear that, the fundamental difference with us.", "The administration says over and over that the outsourcing of millions of American jobs is good.", "We're against it.", "We want to get rid of tax cuts for companies sending jobs overseas.", "We want to balance this budget, get back to fiscal responsibility.", "And we want to invest in the creative, innovative jobs of the future.", " Gwen, we've got 111 million American taxpayers that have benefited from our income tax cuts.", "We've got 33 million students who've benefited from No Child Left Behind.", "We've got 40 million seniors who benefited from the reform of the Medicare system.", "The Democrats promised prescription drug benefits.", "For years they've run on that platform.", "They never got it done.", "The president got it done.", "So the story, I think, is a good one.", "And the data he's using is old data.", "It's from 2003.", "It doesn't include any of the gains that we've made in the last years.", "We've added 1.7 million jobs to the economy.", "Millions of people have lost their jobs.", "Millions have fallen into poverty.", "Family incomes are down, while the cost of everything is going up.", "Medical costs are up the highest they've ever been over the last four years.", "We have this mess in Iraq.", "Mr. Vice President, I don't think the country can take four more years of this kind of experience.", " Because we will do what they've not done.", "You know, if you look at what's happened over the last four years, we have gone from a $5 trillion projected surplus when George Bush took office to a $3 trillion projected deficit.", "They promised they were going to put $2 trillion of the surplus aside from Social Security.", "Not done.", "John Kerry and I believe we have a moral responsibility not to leave trillions of debt to our children and our grandchildren.", "We want to keep the tax cuts that are in place for people who make less than $200,000 a year and give additional tax cuts to those middle-class families, tax cuts for health care, tax cuts to help families pay for their college tuition, tax cuts for child care.", "One of the amazing things that's happened is they've actually layered on more supervisory people, people at the supervisory level, in this government.", "We also want to close some corporate loopholes.", "We can't eliminate this deficit.", "We cannot do it.", "But we can cut the deficit in half.", "And if we move, we can move this country back on a path to fiscal responsibility.", " Gwen, the Kerry record on taxes is one basically of voting for a large number of tax increases -- 98 times in the United States Senate.", "We think that's the wrong way to go.", "They talk about the top bracket and going after only those people in the top bracket.", "Well, the fact of the matter is a great many of our small businesses pay taxes under the personal income taxes rather than the corporate rate.", "And about 900,000 small businesses will be hit if you do, in fact, do what they want to do with the top bracket.", "It's a bad idea to increase the burden on those folks.", "The fact of the matter is, the president and I will go forward to make the tax cuts permanent.", "That's good policy.", "That's what we ought to do.", "But with fiscal restraint, we'll also drive the deficit down 50 percent in the course of the next five years.", " We are committed to cutting back anything in our programs that need to be cut back to get us back on a path to fiscal responsibility.", "John Kerry, Mr. Vice President, has voted or co-sponsored over 600 times tax cuts for the American people -- over 600 times.", "We are for more tax cuts for the middle class than they're for, have been for the last four years.", "But we are not for more tax cuts for multimillionaires.", "They are.", "And it is a fundamental difference in what we think needs to be done in this country.", "And I said then and I believe today that freedom does mean freedom for everybody.", "People ought to be free to choose any arrangement they want.", "It's really no one else's business.", "Traditionally, that's been an issue for the states.", "That would be my preference.", "In effect, what's happened is that in recent months, especially in Massachusetts, but also in California, but in Massachusetts we had the Massachusetts Supreme Court direct the state of -- the legislature of Massachusetts to modify their constitution to allow gay marriage.", "And the fact is that the president felt that it was important to make it clear that that's the wrong way to go, as far as he's concerned.", "We value work in this country.", "I think they love her very much.", "And there are millions of parents like that who love their children, who want their children to be happy.", "And I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman, and so does John Kerry.", "I also believe that there should be partnership benefits for gay and lesbian couples in long-term, committed relationships.", "But we should not use the Constitution to divide this country.", "No state for the last 200 years has ever had to recognize another state's marriage.", "This is using the Constitution as a political tool, and it's wrong.", "I think we've both said the same thing all along.", "But we also believe that gay and lesbians and gay and lesbian couples, those who have been in long-term relationships, deserve to be treated respectfully, they deserve to have benefits.", "I mean, those are not the kind of things that John Kerry and I believe in.", "But we don't -- we do believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman.", "I want to make sure people understand that the president is proposing a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage that is completely unnecessary.", "Under the law of this country for the last 200 years, no state has been required to recognize another state's marriage.", "My state of North Carolina would not be required to recognize a marriage from Massachusetts, which you just asked about.", "There is absolutely no purpose in the law and in reality for this amendment.", "It's nothing but a political tool.", "And it's being used in an effort to divide this country on an issue that we should not be dividing America on.", "We ought to be talking about issues like health care and jobs and what's happening in Iraq, not using an issue to divide this country in a way that's solely for political purposes.", "It's wrong.", "I was in New Mexico the other day and met with a group of OB/GYN docs.", "My home state of Wyoming, we've lost the top insurer of malpractice insurance in the state.", "The rates for a general practitioner have gone from $40,000 a year to $100,000 a year for an insurance policy.", "We think this has a devastating impact on the quality of health care.", "As I say, high risk patients don't get covered anymore.", "We've lost one out of eleven OB/GYN practitioners in the country.", "Now, specifically, what we need to do is cap non-economic damages, and we also think you need to limit the awards that the trial attorneys take out of all of this.", "Over 50 percent of the settlements go to the attorneys and for administrating overhead.", "We passed medical liability reform through the House of Representatives.", "It's been blocked in the Senate.", "We do have too many lawsuits.", "And the reality is there's something that we can do about it.", "John Kerry and I have a plan to do something about it.", "We want to put more responsibility on the lawyers to require, before a case, malpractice, which the vice president just spoke about, have the case reviewed by independent experts to determine if the case is serious and meritorious before it can be filed; hold the lawyers responsible for that, certify that and hold the lawyer financially responsible if they don't do it; have a three-strikes-and-you're-out rule so that a lawyer who files three of these cases without meeting this requirement loses their right to file these cases.", "That way we keep the cases out of the system that don't belong in the system.", "We believe cases that don't belong in the system should never be in the system.", "It turns out the company knew of 12 other children who had either been killed or severely injured by the same problem.", "They hid it.", "They didn't tell anybody.",

says, in effect, it has to cover 25 percent of the cost of the program.", "And the reason the money had to go into the trust fund was to make certain that we could cover those eligible for benefits.",

of education as well as providing the kinds of medicines that will help people control the infection.", "I have not heard those numbers with respect to African- American women.", " Well, first, with respect to what's happening in Africa and Russia and in other places around the world, the vice president spoke about the $15 billion for AIDS.", "John Kerry and I believe that needs to be doubled.",

of one man today, the president of the United States.", "They've gone back and forth.", " Well, Gwen, I can think of a lot of words to describe Senator Kerry's position on Iraq; \"consistent\" is not one of them.", "We have looked to our commanders on the ground in Iraq for guidance on what they think they need.", "If they need more troops, they'll ask us.", "But the key here is not to try to solve the problems in Iraq by putting in more American troops.", "The key is to get the Iraqis to take on the responsibility for their own security.", "That's exactly what we're doing.", "If you put American troops in there in larger number and don't get the Iraqis into the fight, you'll postpone the day when you can in fact bring our boys home.", "It's vital that we deal with any need for

lot of support for the Patriot Act, when we passed that on a bipartisan basis.", "Now we're seeing objection to that by the other side.", "All I know is to continue to try to work it.", "I think, in part, it may be the change in the majority-minority status in the Senate has been difficult for both sides to adjust to.", "And the Senate, of course, has been very evenly divided, 50-50, then 51-49,

Kerry and I believe that we can do better.", "We believe in a strong middle-class in this country.", "That's why we have a plan to create jobs, getting rid of tax cuts for companies outsourcing your jobs; give tax cuts to companies that'll keep jobs here in America.", "That's why we have a health care plan.", "That's why we have a plan to keep you safe and to fix this mess in Iraq.", "The truth is that every four years you get to decide.", "You have the ability to decide where America's going to go.", "John Kerry and I are asking you to give us the power to fight for you, to fight to keep that dream in America, that I saw as a young man, alive for every parent sitting at that kitchen table.", "We won't be happy until every American who wants to work can find a job.", "We believe that

to make certain that it's there for future generations.", "We saw on 9/11 that the next president -- next decision a president has to make can affect the lives of all of us.", "Now we find ourselves in the midst of a conflict unlike any we've ever known, faced with the possibility that terrorists could smuggle a deadly biological agent or a nuclear weapon into the middle of one of our own cities.", "The only viable option for winning the war on terrorism is the one the president has chosen, to use the power of the United States to aggressively go after the terrorists wherever we find them and also to hold to account states that sponsor terror.", "Now that we've captured or killed thousands of Al Qaida and taken down the regimes of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban, it's important that we stand up democratically elected governments as the only guarantee that they'll never again revert to terrorism or the production of deadly weapons.", "This is the task of our generation.", "This is uh - an effort that ought to be done primarily by strong leadership in the White House, the inspiration of our people, the tapping of uh - business, agriculture, industry, labor and government at all levels to work on this uh project.", "There are several things that can be done specifically that are not now being done.", "First of all, to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide uh large numbers of jobs.", "Secondly, we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh - to cooperate with government in matters like housing.", "Here a very small investment of taxpayer's money - in the housing field can bring large numbers of extra jobs, and the guarantee of mortgage loans, and the uh - putting forward of uh - two-0-two programs for housing for older people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exists in the - in the construction industry.", "Another thing is to deal with our - uh needs in the central cities, where the unemployment rate is extremely high: sometimes among minority groups, or those who don't speak English, or who're black, or young people, or - 40 percent of the employment.", "Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah - cha- in - in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work.", "Another very important - uh aspect of our - uh economy would be to increase production in every way possible, uh to hold down - uh taxes on individuals, and to uh shift the tax burdens onto those who have avoided paying taxes in the past.", "These uh - kinds of specific things, uh none of which are being done now, would be a great help in - in reducing uh unemployment.", "There is uh - uh an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very - very succinctly, and that is, to make sure that we have a good relationship between management - business on the one hand, and labor, on the other.", "ery high, we might channel specific uh targeted job - job - uh opportunities by paying part of the salary of unemployed people - uh and also sharing with uh - local governments the uh - payment of salaries which would uh - let us cut down the unemployment rate much lower, before we hit the inflationary level.", "And I think this would uh - this would be uh easy to accomplish, to get jobs down, without having strong in- inflationary pressures that - that would be necessary.", "I would not favor the uh - payment of uh - of a given fixed income to people unless they are not able to work.", "But with tax incentives for the low-income groups we could build up their uh - income levels uh - above the poverty level and not uh make welfare more uh - profitable than - than work.", " I don't believe that uh that Mr. Carter's been any more specific in this case than he has been on many other instances.", "I notice particularly that he didn't endorse the Humphrey-Hawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform.", "Those are the kind of specifics that I think we have to discuss on these uh - debates, and these are the kind of programs that I'll talk about on my time.", " At the time, Mr. Gannon, that I made the recommendation for a $28 billion tax cut - three-quarters of it to go to individual taxpayers and 25 percent to American business.", "I said at the time that we had to hold the lid an federal spending, that for every dollar of a tax reduction we had to have an equal reduction in federal expenditures - a one-for-one proposition.", "And I recommended that to the Congress with a budget ceiling of three hundred and ninety-five billion dollars, and that would have permitted us to have a $25 billion tax reduction.", "In my tax reduction program for middle-income taxpayers, I recommended that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person.", "That would mean, of course, that for a family of four that that family would have a thousand dollars more personal exemption - money that they could spend for their own purposes, money that the government wouldn't have to spend.", "In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending.", "For the last ten years the budget of the United States has grown from uh - about 11 percent per year.", "We can't afford that kind of growth in federal spending.", "And in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half - a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one-half percent.", " That tax bill does not entirely meet the criteria that I established.", "I think the Congress should have uh - added another $10 billion reduction in personal income taxes, including the increase of personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars.", "I'm sure that you know that in the resolutions passed by the Congress, that have added about $17 billion in more spending, by the Congress over the budget that I recommended.", "So I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending.", "Now this tax bill - that hasn't reached the White House yet, but is expected in a day or two - it's about fifteen hundred pages.", "It has some good provisions in it.", "It has - uh left out some that I have recommended, unfortunately.", "On the other hand, uh when you have a bill of that magnitude, with - tho- those many provisions, a president has to sit and decide if there's more good than bad.", "And from the a- analysis that I've made so far, it seems to me that that tax bill does uh - justify my signature and my approval.", " Well, Mr. Ford is - is uh changing uh considerably his previous philosophy.", "The present tax structure is a disgrace to this country; it's just a welfare program for the rich.", "As a matter of fact, uh - 25 percent of the total tax deductions, go for only 1 percent of the richest people in this country, and over 50 percent of the tax uh credits go for the 14 percent of the richest people in this country.", "When Mr. Ford first became president in - in August of 1974, the first thing he did in - in October was to ask for a $4.7 billion increase in taxes on our people in the midst of the heaviest recession, since uh - since the great depression of nineteen uh - of the 1940s.", "In uh - January of 1975 he asked for a tax change: a $5.6 billion increase on low-and-middle-income private individuals, a six and a half billion dollar decrease on the corporations and the special interests.", "In uh - December of uh - 1975 he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion dollar uh tax-reduction bill that had been passed by the Congress, and then he came back later on in January of this year and he did advocate a $10 billion tax reduction, but it would be offset by a $6 billion increase this coming January in deductions for Social Security payments and for unemployment compensation.", "The whole philosophy of the Republican party, including uh - my opponent, has been to pile on taxes on low-income people to take 'em off on the corporations.", "As a matter fact, in - sin- since the late sixties when Mr. Nixon took office, we've had a reduction in uh - in the percentage of taxes paid by corporations from 30 percent down to about 20 percent.", "We've had an increase in taxes paid by individuals, payroll taxes, from14 Percent up to 20 percent.", "And this is what the Republicans have done to us.", "And this is why a tax reform is so important.", " Well, as a matter of fact there is.", "If we assume the ah - uh - a rate of growth of our economy, equivalent to what it was during President Johnson, President Kennedy, even before the - the - the - uh wa uh - Vietnese- namese War, and if we assume that at the end of the four-year period we can cut our unemployment rate down to 4 to 4 and a half percent - under those circumstances, even assuming no elimination of unnecessary programs and assuming an increase in the ad- in the allotment of money to finance programs, increasing as the inflation rate does - my economic projections, I think confirmed by the House uh - and the Senate committees, have been with the $60 billion extra amount of money that can be spent in fiscal year '81 which will be the last year of this next term.", "Within that sixty-billion dollars increase there would be fit the programs that I promised the American people.", "I believe that we ought to have a balanced budget during normal economic circumstances.", "And uh - these projections have been very carefully made.", "I stand behind them.", " I believe that it's accurate to say that - that the - that the committees to whom you refer with the - the employment that you uh - state, and with the 5 to 5 and a half percent growth rate in our economy, that the uh - projections would be a uh - a $60 billion increase in the amount of money that we'd have to spend in l981 compared to now.", "And uh - with that uh - in that framework would befit the - any improvements in the programs.", "Now this does not include uh - any uh - uh extra control over uh unnecessary spending, the weeding out of obsolete or obsolescent programs.", "Uh - we'll have uh - a safety version built in with complete reorganization of the executive branch of government which I am pledged to do.", "The present bureaucratic structure of the - of the Federal Government is a mess.", "And if I'm elected president that's gonna be a top priority of mine to completely revise the structure of the federal government, to make it economical, efficient, purposeful and manageable for a change.", "Keep my promises to the American people.", "And it's just predicated on very modest, but I think accurate, projections of employment increases and uh - a growth in our national economy equal to what was experienced under Kennedy, Johnson, before the Vietnam War.", "But I am uh - very glad to point out that since 1969, during a Republican administrations, we have had ten million people taken off of the tax rolls at the lower end of the taxpayer area.", "And at the same time, assuming that I sign the tax bill that was mentioned by Mr. Gannon, we will in the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers.", "I've heard of those dividends in the past; it always happens.", "We expected one at the time of the Vietnam War, but it was used up before we ever ended the war and taxpayers never got the adequate relief they deserved.", " The amnesty program that I recommended in Chicago in September of 1974 would give to all draft evaders and - uh military deserters the opportunity to earn their uh - good record back.", "About fourteen to fifteen thousand did take advantage of that program.", "We gave them ample time.", "I am against- an across-the-board pardon of draft evaders or military deserters.", "Now in the case of Mr. Nixon, the reason the - the pardon was given, was that, when I took office this country was in a very, very divided condition.", "There was hatred, there was divisiveness - uh people had lost faith in their government in many, many respects.", "Mr. Nixon resigned, and I became president.", "It seemed to me that if I was to uh adequately and effectively handle the problems of high inflation, a growing recession, the uh - involvement of the United States still in Vietnam that I had to give a hundred percent of my time to those two major problems.", "Mr. Nixon resigned.", "That is disgrace.", "The first President out of thirty-eight that ever resigned from public office under pressure.", "I do not agree with that point of view.", "I gave, in September of 1974, an opportunity for all draft evaders, all deserters, to come in voluntarily, clear their records by earning an opportunity to restore their good citizenship.", "I think we gave them a good opportunity - we're - I don't think we should go any further.", "Amnesty means that - that you uh - that what you did was right.", "Pardon means that what you did, whether it's right or wrong, you're forgiven for it.", "And I do advocate a pardon for - for draft evaders.", "I think it's accurate to say that in uh - two years ago when Mr. Nixon - Mr. Ford put in this uh amnesty that three times as many deserters were uh - excused as were - as were the uh - the ones who evaded the draft.", "But I think that now is the time to heal our country after the Vietnam War and I think that what the people are concerned about is not the - uh pardon or the amnesty of uh - those who evaded the draft, but - but whether or not our crime system is - is fair.", "We've got a - a sharp distinction drawn between white collar crime - the - the - the big shots who are rich, who are influential uh very seldom go to jail; those who are poor and - and who have uh no influence - uh quite often are the ones who are punished.", "But I - I hope to have a complete uh responsibility on my shoulders to help bring about a - a fair uh - criminal justice system and also to - to bring about uh - an end to the - to the divise- divisiveness that has occurred in our country uh as a result of the Vietnam War.", "When I took aver we had uh a bureaucratic mess, like we have in Washington now, and we had three hundred agencies, departments, bureaus, commissions - uh some uh - fully budgeted, some not, but all having responsibility to carry out that was in conflict.", "And we cut those three hundred - uh agencies and so forth down substantially.", "We eliminated two hundred and seventy-eight of them.", "We set up a simple structure of government that could be administrated fairly and it was a - a tremendous success.", "It hasn't been undone since I was there.", "It resulted also in an ability to reshape our court system, our prison system, our education system, our mental health programs and - and a clear assignment of responsibility and - and authority and also to have uh our people once again understanding control our government.", "When I get to Washington, coming in as an outsider, one of the major responsibilities that - that I will have on my shoulder is a complete reorganization of the - of the executive branch of government.", "We now have uh - a greatly expanded White House staff.", "When Mr. Nixon went in office, for instance, we had three and a half million dollars spent on - on the White House and its staff.", "That has escalated now to sixteen and a half million dollars, in the last uh Republican administration.", "This needs to be changed.", "We need to put the responsibilities back on the cabinet members.", "We also need to have a great reduction in agencies and programs.", "For instance, we now have uh - in the health area three hundred and two different programs administered by eleven major departments and agencies, sixty other advisory commissions responsible for this.", "Medicaid's in one agency; Medicare is in a different one.", "The - the check on the quality of health care is in a different one.", "None of them uh are responsible for health care itself.", "This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program.", "We have uh - just advocated uh - this past week a consolidation of the responsibilities for energy.", "Our country now has no comprehensive energy program or policy.", "We have twenty different agencies in the federal government responsible for the production, the regulation, the uh - information about energy, the conservation of energy, spread all over government.", " I can't say for sure that we would have fewer federal employees when I go out of office than when I come in.", "It took me about three years to completely reorganize the Georgia government.", "The last year I was in office uh - our budget was - was actually less than it was a year before, uh which showed a great uh improvement.", "Also, we had a - a 2 percent increase in the number of employees the last year.", "But it was a tremendous shift from administrative jobs into the delivery of services.", "For instance, we uh - completely revised our prison system.", "We established eighty-four new mental health treatment centers.", "And we shifted people out of administrative jobs into the field to deliver better services.", "The same thing will be done uh - at the federal government level.", "I - I accomplished this with s - substantial reductions in employees in some departments.", "For instance, in the Transportation Department uh we had uh - we cut back about 25 percent of the total number of employees.", "In giving our people better mental health care, we increased the number of employees.", "But the efficiency of it, the simplicity of it, the uh ability of people to understand their own government and control it was a - was a uh - substantial benefit derived from complete reorganization.", "We uh - have got to do that at the federal government level.", "There's no way for our people now to understand what their government is.", "There's no way to get the answer to a question.", "When you come to Washington to try to - as a governor - to try to begin a new program for your people, like uh the treatment of drug addicts, I found there were thirteen different federal agencies that I had to go to, to manage the uh drug treatment program.", "In the Georgia government we only had one agency responsible for drug treatment.", "This is the kind of change that would be made.", "And uh - it would be of - of tremendous benefit in long-range planning, in tight budgeting, uh saving the taxpayers' money, making the government more efficient, cutting down on bureaucratic waste, having a clear delineation of authority and responsibility of employees, and giving our people a better chance to understand and control their government.", " I think the record should show, Mr. Newman, that uh - the Bureau of Census - we checked it just yesterday - indicates that uh - in the four years that uh - Governor Carter was governor of the state of Georgia, uh - expenditures by the government went up over 50 percent Uh - employees of the government in Georgia during his term of office went up over 25 percent; and the figures also show that the uh, uh - bonded indebtedness of the state of Georgia during his governorship went up over 20 percent.", "And there was some very interesting testimony given by Governor Carter's successor, Governor Busby, before a Senate committee a few uh - months ago on how he found the Medicaid program when he came into office following Governor Carter.", "He testified, and these are his words - the present governor of Georgia - he says he found the Medicaid program in Georgia in shambles.", "Now let me talk about what we've done in the White House as far as federal employees are concerned The first order that I issued after I became president was to cut or eliminate the prospective forty-thousand increase in federal employees that had been scheduled by my predecessor.", "And in the term that I've been president - some two years - we have reduced federal employment by eleven thousand.", "In the White House staff itself, when I became president, we had roughly five hundred and forty employees.", "So I think our record of cutting back employees, plus the failure on the part of the Governor's programs to actually save employment in Georgia, shows which is the better plan.", " Well, in the uh - last two years, as I indicated before, we had a very tough time.", "We were faced with uh - heavy inflation, over 12 percent; we were faced with substantial unemployment.", "But in the last uh - twenty-four months we've turned the economy around and we've brought inflation down to under 6 percent, and we have reduced the uh - well, we have added employment of about four million in the last seventeen months to the point where we have eighty-eight million people working in America today - the most in the history of the country.", "The net result is we are going to have some improvement in our receipts.", "And I think we'll have some decrease in our disbursements.", "We expect to have a lower deficit in fiscal year 1978.", "We have recommended that in the h- housing program we can reduce down payments and moderate monthly payments.", "But that doesn't cost any more as far as the federal treasury is concerned.", "That doesn't cost any more money.", "We believe that you can uhh - do something more effectively with a moderate increase in money in the drug abuse program.", "We feel that uh - in education we can have a slight increase - not a major increase.", "It's my understanding that Governor Carter has indicated that uh - he approves of a $30 billion uh - expenditure by the federal government as far as education is concerned.", "At the present time we're spending roughly three billion five hundred million dollars.", "I don't know where that money would come from.", "But as we look at the quality-of-life programs - jobs, health, education, crime, recreation - we feel that as we move forward with a healthier economy, we can absorb the small necessary cost that will be required.", "We won't wait one year or two years longer, as Governor Carter uh - indicates.", "As the economy improves, and it is improving, our gross national product this year will average about 6 percent increase over last year.", "We will have the lower rate of inflation for the uh - calendar year this year - something slightly under 6 percent.", "Employment will be up, revenues will be up.", "We'll keep the lid on some of these programs that we can hold down as we have a little extra money to spend for those quality-of-life programs which I think are needed and necessary.", "Now I cannot, and would not, endorse the kind of program that uh - Governor Carter recommends.", "He endorses the Democratic uh - platform which, as I read it, calls for approximately sixty additional programs.", "We estimate that those programs would add a hundred billion dollars minimum and probably two hundred billion dollars - uhh maximum each year to the federal budget.", "Those programs you cannot afford and give tax relief.", "We feel that you can hold the line and restrain federal spending, give a tax reduction and still have a balanced budget by 1978.", " Well, Mr. Ford takes the uh - same attitude that the Republicans always take.", "In the last three months before an election, they're always for the programs that they always fight the other three-and-one-half years.", "Uh - I remember when uh - Herbert Hoover was against uh - jobs for people.", "I remember when Alf Landon was against Social Security and uh - later President Nixon, sixteen years ago, was telling the public that John Kennedy's proposals would bankrupt the country and would double the cost.", "Uh - we had last year a $65 billion deficit - the largest deficit in the history of our country - more of a deficit spending than we had in the entire eight-year period under President Johnson and President Kennedy.", "We've got five hundred thousand more Americans out of jobs today than were out of work three months ago and since Mr. Ford's been in office two years, we've had a 50 percent increase in unemployment from five million people out of work to two and a half million more people out of work and a total of seven and a half million.", "He's got four times the size of the deficits that Mr. Nixon even had himself.", "The take-home pay of a worker in this country is actually less now than it was in 1968 - measured in real dollars.", " Well among my other experiences in the past, I've - I've been a nuclear engineer, and did graduate work in this field.", "I think I know the - the uh capabilities and limitations of atomic power.", "But the energy - uh policy of our nation is one that uh has not yet been established under this administration.", "I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy except us.", "We have seen uh - the Federal Energy Agency established, for instance.", "Uh - in the crisis of 1973 it was supposed to be a temporary agency, uh now it's permanent, it's enormous, it's growing every day.", "I think the Wall Street Journal uh reported not too long ago they have a hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people its own existence.", "We've got to have a - a firm way to handle the energy question.", "The reorganization proposal that I have put forward is one uh first step.", "We're gonna run out of oil.", "When Mr. Nixon made his famous uh speech on Operation Independence we were importing about 35 percent of our oil.", "Now we've increased that amount 25 percent.", "We now import about 44 percent of our oil.", "We need to shift from oil to coal.", "We need to concentrate our research and development effort on uh coal burning and extraction, with safer mines, but also it's clean burning.", "We need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures.", "And then as a last resort only, continue to use atomic power.", "I would certainly uh - not cut out atomic power altogether.", "We can't afford to give up that opportunity until later.", "But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained.", "For instance, some that have been forgotten; we need to have the reactor core - below ground level, the entire power plant that uses atomic uh - power tightly sealed and a heavy - heavy vacuum maintained.", "There ought to be a standardized design.", "These kinds of uh - procedures, along with evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated.", "So, shift from oil to coal, emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power, strict conservation measures, not yield every time that the special interest groups uh - put pressure on the president like uh this administration has done, and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strictest possible safety precautions.", "That's the best overall energy policy in the brief time we have to discuss it.", " Yes, I would.", "Some of the things that can be done about this is a change in the rate structure of electric power companies.", "We uh - now encourage people to waste electricity, and uh - by giving uh - the lowest rates to the biggest users.", "We don't do anything to cut down on peak load requirements.", "We don't have an adequate requirement for the insulation of homes, for the efficiency of automobiles.", "And whenever the uh - automobile manufacturers come forward and say they can't meet the uh - amendments that the Congress has put forward, this Republican administration has delayed the implementation dates.", "In addition to that, we ought to have a - a shift toward the use of coal, particularly in the Appalachian regions where the coal is located.", "A lot of uh - very high quality, low-carbon coal, uh - low-sulfur coal is there, it's where our employment is needed.", "Uh - this would - would help a great deal.", "So mandatory conservation measures - yes.", "Encouragement by the president for people to uh voluntarily conserve - yes.", "And also the private sector ought to be encouraged to - to bring forward to the public the benefits from efficiency.", "One bank in uh - Washington, fo- for instance, gives lower interest loans for people who adequately insulate their homes or who buy efficient automobiles.", "And some major uh - uh - manufacturing companies, like Dow Chemical, have through uh - very effective efficiency mechanism cut down the use of energy by uh - as much as 40 percent with the same out-product.", "These kinds of things uh - ought to be done, uh they ought to be encouraged and supported, and even required uh by the government, yes.", "In January of uh - 1975 I submitted to the Congress and to the American people the first comprehensive energy program recommended by any president.", "It called for an increase in the production of energy in the United States.", "It called for uh - conservation measures so that we would save the energy that we have.", "I recommended to the Congress that we should increase production in this country from six hundred million tons a year to twel- a- a billion two hundred million tons by 1985.", "In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground; we have to improve our utilization of coal - make it more efficient, make it cleaner.", "In addition we uh - have to expand our research and development.", "In my program for energy independence we have increased, for example, solar energy research from about $84 million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year.", "We're going as fast as the experts say we should.", "I think you have to have greater oil and gas production, more coal production, more nuclear production, and in addition you have to have energy conservation.", " The bills that I vetoed, the one for an additional $6 billion, was not a bill that would have solved our unemployment problems.", "Even the proponents of it admitted that no more than four hundred thousand jobs would be uh - made available.", "Our analysis indicates that something in the magnitude of about one hundred fifty to two hundred thousand jobs would uh - be made available.", "Each one of those jobs would've cost the taxpayers $25 thousand.", "In addition, the jobs would not be available right now.", "They would not have materialized for about nine to eighteen months.", "The immediate problem we have is to stimulate our economy now so that we can get rid of unemployment.", "What we have done is to hold the lid on spending in an effort to reduce the rate of inflation.", "And we have proven, I think very conclusively, that you can reduce the rate of inflation and increase jobs.", "For example, as I have said, we have added some four million jobs in the last seventeen months.", "We have now employed eighty-eight million people in America, the largest number in the history of the United States.", "We've added five hundred thousand jobs in the last two months.", "Inflation is the quickest way to destroy jobs.", "And by holding the lid on federal spending we have been able to do an- a good job, an affirmative job in inflation and as a result have added to the jobs in this country.", "But that is an extra $4 billion that would uh - add to the deficit which would add to the inflationary pressures, which would help to destroy jobs in the private sector - not make jobs, where the jobs really are.", "These make-work, temporary jobs - dead end as they are - are not the kind of jobs that we want for our people.", "I think it's interesting to point out that uh - in the uh - two years that I've been president I've vetoed fifty-six bills.", "Congress has sustained forty-two vetoes.", "As a result, we have saved over $9 billion in federal expenditures.", "And the Congress by overriding the bills that I did veto, the Congress has added some $13 billion to the federal expenditures and to the federal deficit.", "Now Governor Carter complains about the deficits that uh - uh - this administration has had.", "And yet he condemns the vetoes that I have made that has - that have saved the taxpayer $9 billion and could have saved an additional $13 billion.", "Now he can't have it both ways.", "I was in uh - a city in uh - Pennsylvania not too long ago, near here, and uh - there were about four or five thousand people in the audience - it was on a - on a train trip.", "And I said, \"How many uh - adults here are out of work?\"", "About a thousand raised their hands.", "Mr. Ford uh - actually has fewer people now in the private sector in non-farm jobs than when he took office.", "And still he talks about - uh success.", "Seven point nine percent unemployment is a terrible tragedy in this country.", "He says he's learned how to match unemployment with inflation.", "We've got the highest inflation we've had in twenty-five years right now, except under this administration, and that was fifty years ago.", "And we've got uh - the highest unemployment we've had uh - under Mr. Ford's administration, since the Great Depression.", "This affects human beings, and - and his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration, and not a work administration.", "He hasn't saved $9 billion with his vetoes.", "There's only been uh - a net savings of $4 billion.", "And the cost in unemployment compensation, welfare compensation, and lost revenues has increased $23 billion in the last two years.", "This is a - a typical attitude that really causes havoc in people's lives, and then it's covered over by saying that our country has naturally got a 6 percent unemployment rate, or 7 percent unemployment rate and a 6 percent inflation.", "It's a travesty.", "It shows a lack of leadership.", "And we've never had a president since the War between the States that vetoed more bills.", "Mr. Ford has vetoed four times as many bills as Mr. Nixon - per year.", "And eleven of 'em have been overridden.", "One of his bills that was overridden - he only got one vote in the Senate and seven votes in the House, from Republicans.", "Over 50 percent - 53 to be exact - percent of the tax benefits go to the 14 percent richest people in this country, and we've had a 50 percent increase in payroll deductions since Mr. Nixon went in office eight years ago.", "Mr. Ford has - has advocated since he's been in office over $5 billion in reductions for corporations, special interest groups, and the very, very wealthy who derive their income - not from labor - but from investments.", "That's got to be changed.", "Another thing is a system called DISC which was originally designed, proposed by Mr. Nixon, to encourage exports.", "This permits a company to create uh - a dummy corporation, to export their products, and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them.", "This costs our uh - government about uh - $1.4 billion a year.", "Another one that's uh - that's very important is the uh - is the business deductions, uh - jet airplanes, uh - first class travel, the fifty-dollar martini lunch.", "The average working person can't - uh - can't take advantage of that, but the - the wealthier people - uh can.", "Uh - another system is where uhh - a dentist can invest money in say, raising cattle and uh - can put in a hundred thousand dollars of his own money, borrow nine hundred thousand dollars - nine hundred mi- thousand dollars - that makes a million - and mark off a great amount of uh - of loss uh - through that procedure.", "Uh - there was one example, for instance, where uh - somebody uh - produced pornographic movies.", "They put in $30 thousand of their own money and got a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in tax savings.", "Well, these special kinds of programs have - have robbed the average taxpayer and have benefited those who are powerful, and who can employ lobbyists, and who can have their CPAs and their lawyers to help them benefit from the roughly uh - eight thousand pages of the tax code.", "The average uh American person can't do it.", "You can't hire a lobbyist uh out of unemployment compensation checks.", " No, I wouldn't do away with all - uh business deductions.", "I think that would be a - a very serious mistake.", "I would never do anything that would increase the taxes for those who work for a living, or who are presently required to list all their income.", "What I wanna do is not to raise taxes, but to eliminate loopholes.", "And this is uh - the point of my first statistics that I gave you - that - that the present tax benefits that have been carved out over a long period of years - fifty years - by sharp tax lawyers and by lobbyists have benefited just the rich.", "It's to make sure that everybody pays taxes on the income that they earn and make sure that you take whatever savings there is from the higher income levels and give it to the lower- and middle-income families.", " Governor Carter's answer tonight does not coincide with the answer that he gave in an interview to the Associated Press a week or so ago.", "In that interview uh - Governor Carter indicated that uh - he would raise the taxes on those in the medium or middle-income brackets or higher.", "Now if you uh - take the medium or middle-income taxpayer - that's about $14 thousand per person - uh - Governor Carter has indicated, publicly, in an interview that he would increase the taxes on about 50 percent of the working people of this country.", "I think uh - the way to get tax equity in this country is to give tax relief to the middle-income people who have an income from roughly $8 thousand up to twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars.", "I believe in tax equity for the middle-income taxpayer, increasing the personal exemption.", "Mr. Carter wants to increase taxes for roughly half of the taxpayers of this country.", "Now, the Governor has also played a little fast and loose with the facts about vetoes.", "The records show that President Roosevelt vetoed an average of fifty-five bills a year.", "President Truman vetoed on the average, while he was president, about thirty-eight bills a year.", "I understand that Governor Carter, when he was Governor of Georgia, vetoed between thirty-five and forty bills a year.", "My average in two years is twenty-six.", "But in the process of that we have saved uhh - $9 billion.", " There is a considerable anti-Washington feeling throughout the country.", "But I think the feeling is misplaced.", "In the last two years, we have restored integrity in the White House, and we've set high standards in the executive branch of the government.", "The anti-Washington feeling, in my opinion, ought to be focused on the Congress of the United States.", "For example, this Congress, very shortly, will spend a billion dollars a year for its housekeeping, its salaries, its expenses and the like.", "It - the next Congress will probably be the first billion-dollar Congress in the history of the United States.", "I don't think the American people are getting their money's worth from the majority party that run this Congress.", "We, in addition, see that uh - in the last uh - four years the number of employees hired by the Congress has gone up substantial- uh much more than uh - the gross national product, much more than any other increase throughout our society.", "Congress is hiring people by the droves, and the cast as a result has gone up.", "And I don't see any improvement in the performance of the Congress under the present leadership.", "So it seems to me instead of the anti-Washington feeling being aimed at everybody in Washington, it seems to me that the focus should be where the problem is, which is the Congress of the United States, and particularly the majority in the Congress.", "They spend too much money on themselves.", "They have too many employees.", "There's some question about their morality.", "It seems to me that in this election, the focus should not be on the executive branch but the corrections should come as the voters vote for their members of the House of Representatives or for their United States senator.", " Well, It seems to me that uh - we have a chance - the Republicans - to get a majority in the House of Representatives.", "We will make some gains in the United States Senate.", "Supposing we had - had a Democratic Congress for the last two years and we'd had uh - Governor Carter as President.", "He has, in effect, said that he would agree with all of - he would disapprove of the vetoes that I have made, and would have added significantly to expenditures and the deficit in the federal government.", "I think it would be contrary to one of the basic concepts in our system of government - a system of checks and balances.", "We have a Democratic Congress today, and fortunately we've had a Republican president to check their excesses with my vetoes.", " Well, it's not a matter of uh - Republican and Democrat.", "It's a matter of leadership or no leadership.", "President Eisenhower worked with a Democratic Congress very well.", "Even President Nixon, because he was a strong leader at least, worked with a Democratic Congress very well.", "Uh - Mr. Ford has vetoed, as I said earlier, four times as many bills per year as Mr. Nixon.", "Mr. Ford quite often puts forward a program just as a public relations stunt, and never tries to put it through the Congress by working with the Congress.", "I think under presidents For- uh - Nixon and Eisenhower they passed about 60 to 75 percent of their legislation.", "This year Mr. Ford will not pass more than 26 percent of all the legislative proposals he puts forward.", "We've had uh - Republican presidents before who've tried to run against a Democratic - uh Congress.", "That, I think, is a good balance.", "Mr. Ford, so far as I know, except for avoiding another Watergate, has not accomplished one single major program for this country.", "And there's been a constant squabbling between the president and the Congress, and that's not the way this country ought to be run.", "Mr. Ford has uh - misquoted an AP uh - news story that was in error to begin with.", " What I have said is that the president ought to have a chance to appoint a chairman of the Federal Reserve Board to have a coterminous uh term; in other words, both of 'em serve the same four - four years.", "The Federal Reserve has uh - an independent status that ought to be preserved; I think that Mr. uh - Burns did take a typical, erroneous Republican attitude in the 1973 year when inflation was so high.", "They assumed that the uh - inflation rate was because of excessive demand and uh - therefore put into effect tight constraint on the economy, very high interest rates, which is typical also of the Republican administration, uh - tried to increase the uh - the tax uh - payments by individuals, and cut the tax payments by corporations.", "I would have uh - done it opposite.", "I think the uh - problem should've been addressed by increasing productivity, by having uh - put - put people back to work so they could purchase more goods, lower income taxes on individuals, perhaps raise them, if necessary, on corporations in comparison.", "But uh - Mr. Burns uh - in that respect made a very serious mistake.", "I would not wanna destroy the - the independence of the uh Federal Reserve - uh Board.", "But I do think we ought to have a cohesive economic policy with at - at least the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and the president's terms being uh - the same and letting the Congress, of course, be the third uh - entity with uh - with independence subject only to the president's veto.", " The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board should be independent.", "Fortunately, he has been during Democratic as well as Republican administrations.", "Uh the Federal Reserve Board indicated that the supply of money would be held between four to four and a half and seven and seven and a half.", "They have done a good job in integrating the money supply with the uh - fiscal policy of the uh - executive and legislative branches of the government.", "It would be catastrophic if the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board became the tool of the political uh - party that was in power.", "It's important for our future uhh - economic security that that job be nonpolitical and uh - separate from the executive and the Legislative branches.", " You are familiar, of course, with the fact that I am the first president in thirty years who has reorganized the intelligence agencies in the federal government: the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the others.", "We've done that by executive order.", "Uhh - and I think uh - we've tightened it up; we've uh - straightened out their problems that developed over the last few years.", "It doesn't seem to me that it's needed or necessary to have legislation in this particular regard.", "Uhh - I have recommended to the Congress, however - I'm sure you're familiar with this - legislation that would uhh - make it uhh - very uhh - proper in - in the right way, that the attorney general could go in and get the right for wiretapping under security cases.", "This was an effort that was made by the attorney general and myself, working with the Congress.", "But even in this area, where I think new legislation would be justified, uh the Congress has not responded.", "So, I feel in that case, as well as in the reorganization of the intelligence agencies, as I've done, we have to do it by executive order.", "And I'm glad that we have a good director in George Bush.", " There has been too much government secrecy and not uh - not enough respect for the personal privacy of American citizens.", "But I think it's time to talk about the future.", "Our nation in the last eight years has been divided as never before.", "It's a time for unity.", "It's time for government, industry, labor, manufacturing, agriculture, education, other entities in our society to cooperate.", "And it's a time for government to understand and to cooperate with our people.", "For a long time our American citizens have been excluded, sometimes misled, sometimes have been lied to.", "This is uh - not compatible with the purpose of our nation.", "It needs to be competent.", "We need to restore the faith and the trust of the American people in their own government.", "We've got a government of stalemate.", "We've lost the vision of what our country can and ought to be.", "This is not the America that we've known in the past.", "It's not the America that we have to have in the future.", "Our economic strength is still there.", "Our system of government - in spite of Vietnam, Cambodia, CIA, Watergate - is still the best system of government on earth.", "We need a president who can go in - who derives his strength from the people.", "I owe the special interests nothing.", "I owe everything to you, the people of this country.", "And I believe that we can bind our wounds.", "I believe that we can work together.", "I think the real issue in this campaign, and that which you must decide on November second, is whether you should vote for his promise or my performance in two years in the White House.", "On the fourth of July we had a wonderful two hundredth birthday - for our great country.", "It was a superb occasion.", "It was a glorious day.", "In the first century of our nation's history our forefathers gave us the finest form of government in the history of mankind.", "In the second century of our nation's history, our forefathers developed the most productive industrial nation in the history of the globe.", "Our third century should be the century of individual freedom for all our two hundred and fifteen million Americans today and all that join us.", "In the last few years government has gotten bigger and bigger; industry has gotten larger and larger; labor unions have gotten bigger and bigger; and our children have been the victims of mass education.", "We must make this next century the century of the individual.", "The individual worker in the plants throughout the United States should not be a small cog in a big machine.", "The member of a labor union must have his rights strengthened and broadened and our children in their education should have an opportunity to improve themselves based on their talents and their abilities.", "My mother and father, during the Depression, worked very hard to give me an opportunity to do better in our great country.", "Your mothers and fathers did the same thing for you and others.", "Betty and I have worked very hard to give our children a brighter future in the United States, our beloved country.",

talk.", "Nobody has more respect for women than I do.", "And I will tell you that I\u2019m going to make our country safe.", "People are pouring into our country, and they\u2019re coming in from the Middle East and other places.", "You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.", "That was locker room talk.", "I\u2019m not proud of it.", "I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country.", "And certainly, I\u2019m not proud of it.", "He gets to decide what he wants to talk about.", "Instead of answering people\u2019s questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that\u2019s his choice.", "So you really owe him an apology.", "You\u2019re the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb.", " ... because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I\u2019m not surprised.", "And I\u2019m going to fix it, because I agree with you.", "Premiums have gotten too high.",

situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system.", "But we have an employer-based system.", "That\u2019s where the vast majority of people get their health care.", "So let\u2019s fix what\u2019s broken about it, but let\u2019s not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies.", "That\u2019s not going to work.", " We\u2019re going to be able to.", "You\u2019re going to have plans that are so good, because we\u2019re going to have so much competition in the insurance industry.", "You know

house?", "How's it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college?", "So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely.", "And I've put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort.", "Number one, we've got to make sure that we've got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money.", "Number two, we've got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market -- and when the market returns.", "Number three, we've got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes.", "Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down.", "And I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake.", "And I do think that there's constructive work being done out there.", "So, for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan.", "The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place?", "Two years ago, I warned that, because of the subprime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time.", "Last year, I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it.", "So -- so the question, I think, that we've got to ask ourselves is, yes, we've got to solve this problem short term.", "We did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems.", "And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad.", " Well, I think Senator McCain's absolutely right that we need more responsibility, but we need it not just when there's a crisis.", "I mean, we've had years in which the reigning economic ideology has been what's good for Wall Street, but not what's good for Main Street.", "And there are folks out there who've been struggling before this crisis took place.", " I do not think that they are.", " Well, the -- John, 10 days ago, you said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.", "And unless we are holding ourselves accountable day in, day out, not just when there's a crisis for folks who have power and influence and can hire lobbyists, but for the nurse, the teacher, the police officer, who, frankly, at the end of each month, they've got a little financial crisis going on.", "They're having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments.", "We haven't been paying attention to them.", "And if you look at our tax policies, it's a classic example.", " Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up.", "And he's also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn't the case with me.", "But let's be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year's budget.", "Senator McCain is proposing -- and this is a fundamental difference between us -- $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion.", "Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important.", "So my attitude is, we've got to grow the economy from the bottom up.", "What I've called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent.", "And that means that the ordinary American out there who's collecting a paycheck every day, they've got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them.", "And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to -- wants to follow.", "What I do is I close corporate loopholes, stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that we're giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States.", "I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage.", "I think those are pretty important priorities.", "And I pay for every dime of it.", "John, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important.", "And when I'm president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely.", "But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we're going to get the middle class back on track.", " My definition -- here's what I can tell the American people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut.", "And if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dime's worth of tax increase.", "Here's the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world.", "And what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more.", "You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes.", "And that's a problem.", "Now, what he doesn't tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits.", "So you may end up getting a $5,000 tax credit.", "Here's the only problem: Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that you're getting from your employer.", "And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, you've got to go out on the open market and try to buy it.", "It is not a good deal for the American people.", "But it's an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off we're going to be.", " John, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion.", "That's not true.", "And if we want to talk about oil company profits, under your tax plan, John -- this is undeniable -- oil companies would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.", "Now, look, we all would love to lower taxes on everybody.", "But here's the problem: If we are giving them to oil companies, then that means that there are those who are not going to be getting them.", "They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care.", "The third thing we have to do is we've got to make sure that we're competing in education.", "We've got to invest in science and technology.", "China had a space launch and a space walk.", "We've got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science.", "And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America.", "And I also think that we're going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities.", "Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them.", "So there are some -- some things that we've got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy.", "We've got to eliminate programs that don't work, and we've got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less.", "As I said before, Jim, there are going to be things that end up having to be ...", "Well, look, I want to make sure that we are investing in energy in order to free ourselves from the dependence on foreign oil.", "That is a big project.", "That is a multi-year project.", " Not willing to give up the need to do it but there may be individual components that we can't do.", "But John is right we have to make cuts.", "We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system.", "Doesn't work any better through the private insurers.", "They just skim off $15 billion.", "They did it on the Medicaid prescription drug bill and we have to change the culture.", "Tom -- or John mentioned me being wildly liberal.", " The problem with a spending freeze is you're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel.", "There are some programs that are very important that are under funded.", "We are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus.", "It seems to me that if we're going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close.", " There's no doubt it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gonna affect our budgets.", "There is no doubt about it.", "John, it's been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending.", "This orgy of spending and enormous deficits you voted for almost all of his budgets.", "So to stand here and after eight years and say that you're going to lead on controlling spending and, you know, balancing our tax cuts so that they help middle class families when over the last eight years that hasn't happened I think just is, you know, kind of hard to swallow.", "We hadn't caught bin Laden.", "Now Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment.", "And I wish I had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right, but that's not the case.", "We've spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion.", "We have lost over 4,000 lives.", "We have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001.", "So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and I will not, as president, in order to keep the American people safe.", "But we have to use our military wisely.", "And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq.", "Senator McCain is absolutely right that the violence has been reduced as a consequence of the extraordinary sacrifice of our troops and our military families.", "They have done a brilliant job, and General Petraeus has done a brilliant job.", "The war started in 2003, and at the time when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy.", "You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were.", "You were wrong.", "You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators.", "You said that there was no history of violence between Shia and Sunni.", "And you were wrong.", " That's not true.", " That's not true.", "I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush.", "We had a difference on the timetable.", "We didn't have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops.", "We had a legitimate difference, and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy.", "And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there.", "We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate.", "We need more troops there.", "We need more resources there.", "Senator McCain, in the rush to go into Iraq, said, you know what?", "We've been successful in Afghanistan.", "There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there.", "This is a time when bin Laden was still out, and now they've reconstituted themselves.", "Secretary of Defense Robert Gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in Afghanistan and it needs to end there.", "But we can't do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country.", "We should do it in phases.", "But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put -- provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda.", " That's not the case.", "He did not say that.", "That's not true.", " Yes, I think we need more troops.", "We had the highest fatalities among U.S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002.", "And we are seeing a major offensive taking place -- Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion.", "So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan.", "It's not just more troops.", "We have to press the Afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people.", "And I've said this to President Karzai.", "Number two, we've got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years.", "And until we do, Americans here at home are not going to be safe.", " Nobody talked about attacking Pakistan.", "And if John wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the United States has Al Qaida, bin Laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out.", "Now, I think that's the right strategy; I think that's the right policy.", "And, John, I -- you're absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say.", "I think this is the right strategy.", "Now, Senator McCain is also right that it's difficult.", "This is not an easy situation.", "You've got cross-border attacks against U.S. troops.", "And we've got a choice.", "We had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, \"Well, you know, he may be a dictator, but he's our dictator.\"", "We spent $10 billion.", "And in the meantime, they weren't going after Al Qaida, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan.", "That's going to change when I'm president of the United States.", "I've got a bracelet, too, from Sergeant - from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopeck (ph), given to me in green bay.", "She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what I'm going through.", "And we honor all the service that they've provided.", "Our troops have performed brilliantly.", "And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan.", "At one point, while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can \"muddle through\" Afghanistan.", "You don't muddle through the central front on terror and you don't muddle through going after bin Laden.", "You don't muddle through stamping out the Taliban.", "I think that is something we have to take seriously.", "And when I'm president, I will.", "I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization.", "What Senator McCain refers to is a measure in the Senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of Iraq.", "To deal with Iran.", "And ironically, the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq.", "Iraq was Iran's mortal enemy.", "And what we've seen over the last several years is Iran's influence grow.", "They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon.", "So obviously, our policy over the last eight years has not worked.", "We do need tougher sanctions.", "It has not worked in Iran, it has not worked in North Korea.", "In each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons.", "That will change when I'm president of the United States.", "First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran.", "So he may not be the right person to talk to.", "But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it's going to keep America safe.", "And I'm glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy.", " Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, who's one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran -- guess what -- without precondition.", "This is one of your own advisers.", "Now, understand what this means \"without preconditions.\"", "It doesn't mean that you invite them over for tea one day.", "What it means is that we don't do what we've been doing, which is to say, \"Until you agree to do exactly what we say, we won't have direct contacts with you.\"", "There's a difference between preconditions and preparation.", "But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with Iran.", "President Bush recently sent a senior ambassador, Bill Burns, to participate in talks with the Europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons.", "They're a member of the axis of evil.", "They went -- they quadrupled their nuclear capacity.", "They tested a nuke.", "They tested missiles.", "They pulled out of the nonproliferation agreement.", "And they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like Syria.", "Spain is a NATO ally.", " If we can't meet with our friends, I don't know how we're going to lead the world in terms of dealing with critical issues like terrorism.", " Look, I mean, Senator McCain keeps on using this example that suddenly the president would just meet with somebody without doing any preparation, without having low-level talks.", "Nobody's been talking about that, and Senator McCain knows it.", "This is a mischaracterization of my position.", "And, you know, the Bush administration has come to recognize that it hasn't worked, this notion that we are simply silent when it comes to our enemies.", "And the notion that we would sit with Ahmadinejad and not say anything while he's spewing his nonsense and his vile comments is ridiculous.", "Nobody is even talking about that.", " I am not parsing words.", " I'm using the same words that your advisers use.", "Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable.", "They were unwarranted.", "And at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six-party -- or the six-point cease-fire.", "They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia.", "It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship.", "They are members of NATO.", "Now, we also can't return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia.", "It's important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest.", "One is nuclear proliferation.", "This is an area where I've led on in the Senate, working with a Republican ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Dick Lugar, to deal with the proliferation of loose nuclear weapons.", "That's an area where we're going to have to work with Russia.", "But we have to have a president who is clear that you don't deal with Russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul.", "And we have to recognize that the way they've been behaving lately demands a sharp response from the international community and our allies.", " No, actually, I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these issues.", "Obviously, I disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to Russians going into Georgia.", "I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable.", "Because part of Russia's intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more.", "Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems.", "So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory.", "And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over.", "That wasn't done.", "But had it been done, it's possible we could have avoided the issue.", "Russia is in part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as Senator McCain mentioned.", "So we can't simply drill our way out of the problem.", "What we're going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology.", "And, you know, I've got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that.", "Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel.", "I have never said that I object to nuclear waste.", "What I've said is that we have to store it safely.", "Obviously, we've poured billions of dollars into airport security.", "We've got to make sure that we're hardening our chemical sites.", "We haven't done enough in terms of transit; we haven't done enough in terms of ports.", "And the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies.", "It's in a suitcase.", "This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important.", "It is the -- the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons.", "And we -- we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense.", "The other thing that we have to focus on, though, is Al Qaida.", "They are now operating in 60 countries.", "We can't simply be focused on Iraq.", "We have to go to the root cause, and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan.", "That's going to be critical.", "We are going to need more cooperation with our allies.", "It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism.", "And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore America's standing in the world.", "We are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago.", " And this is the greatest country on Earth.", "Look, over the last eight years, this administration, along with Senator McCain, have been solely focused on Iraq.", "That has been their priority.",

oversight.", "He secondly said you have to focus on homeowners and folks on Main Street.", "Thirdly, he said that you have to treat the taxpayers like investors in this case.", "And, lastly, what you have to do is make sure that CEOs don't benefit from this, because this could end up, in the long run, people making money off of this rescue plan.", "And I'll bet you, you're going to hear some fear in that parent's voice, fear regarding the few investments that some of us have in the stock market.", "The barometer there, I think, is going to be resounding that our economy is hurting and the federal government has not provided the sound oversight that we need and that we deserve, and we need reform to that end.", "Now, John McCain thankfully has been one representing reform.", "Two years ago, remember, it was John McCain who pushed so hard with the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reform measures.", "He sounded that warning bell.", "People in the Senate with him, his colleagues, didn't want to listen to him and wouldn't go towards that reform that was needed then.", " Well, that's what I've done my whole career, Gwen, on very, very controversial issues, from dealing with violence against

let Wall Street run wild.", "John McCain and he's a good man, but John McCain thought the answer is that tried and true Republican response, deregulate, deregulate.So what you had is you had overwhelming \"deregulation.\"", "You had actually the belief that Wall Street could self-regulate itself.", "And while Barack Obama was talking about reinstating those regulations, John on 20 different occasions in the previous year and a half called for more deregulation.", "As a matter of fact, John recently wrote an article in a major magazine saying that he wants to do for the health

did reduce taxes.", "I eliminated personal property taxes and eliminated small business inventory taxes and as governor we suspended our state fuel tax.", "We did all of those things knowing that that

proposal, 100 million families, middle class families, households to be precise, they got not a single change, they got not a single break in taxes.", "No one making less than $250,000 under Barack

patriotic.", "Patriotic is saying, government, you know, you're not always the solution.", "In fact, too often you're the problem so, government, lessen the tax burden and on our families and get out of the way and let the private sector and our families grow and thrive and prosper.", "An increased tax formula that Barack Obama is proposing in addition to nearly a trillion dollars in new spending that he's proposing is the backwards way of trying to grow our economy.", "He's proposing a $5,000 tax credit for families so that they can get out there and they can purchase their own health care coverage.", "That's a smart thing to do.", "That's budget neutral.", "But a $5,000 health care credit through our income tax that's budget neutral.", "That's going to help.", "So affordability and accessibility will be the keys there with that $5,000 tax credit also being offered.", "We don't call a redistribution in my neighborhood Scranton, Claymont, Wilmington, the places I grew up, to give the fair to say that not giving Exxon Mobil another $4 billion tax cut this year as John calls for and giving it to middle class people to be able to pay to get their kids to college, we don't call that redistribution.", "We call that fairness number one.", "Number two fact, 95 percent of the small businesses in America, their owners make less than $250,000 a year.", "They would not get one

probably have to slow that down.We also are going to make sure that we do not go forward with the tax cut proposals of the administration -- of John McCain, the existing one for people making over $250,000, which is $130 billion this year alone.", "We're not going to support the $300 billion tax cut that they have for corporate America and the very wealthy.", "We're not going to support another $4 billion tax cut for ExxonMobil.", "And what we're not going to also hold up on, Gwen, is we cannot afford to hold up on providing for incentives for new jobs by an energy policy, creating new jobs.", "The bottom line here is that we are going to, in fact, eliminate those wasteful spending that exist in the budget right now, a number of things I don't have time, because the light is blinking, that I won't be able to mention, but one of which is the $100 billion tax dodge that, in fact, allows people to take their post office box off- shore, avoid taxes.", "Senator Biden, you would remember that, in that energy plan that Obama voted for, that's what gave those oil companies those big tax breaks.", "Your running mate voted for that.", "And I don't believe that John McCain

mortgage crisis and wrote to the secretary of Treasury.", "And he said, \"You'd better get on the stick here.", "You'd better look at it.\"", "John McCain said as early as last December, quote -- I'm paraphrasing -- \"I'm surprised about this subprime mortgage crisis,\" number one.", "Number two, with regard to bankruptcy now, Gwen, what we should be doing now -- and Barack Obama and I support it -- we should be allowing bankruptcy courts to be able to re-adjust not just the interest rate you're paying on your mortgage to be able to stay in your home, but be able to adjust the principal that you owe, the principal that you owe.", "That would keep people in their homes, actually help banks by keeping it from going under.", "There are ways to help people now.", "And there -- ways that we're offering are not being supported by -- by the Bush administration nor do I believe by John McCain and Governor Palin.", "When we talk about energy, we have to consider the need to do all that we can

heck of a lot more than that.", "Energy independence is the key to America's future.", "There is something to be said also for man's activities, but also for the cyclical temperature changes on our planet.", "But there are real changes going on in our climate.", "We have got to clean up this planet.", "We have got to encourage other nations also to come along with us with the impacts of climate change, what we can do about that.", "As governor, I was the first governor to form a climate change sub-cabinet to start dealing with the impacts.", "We've got to reduce emissions.", "John McCain is right there with an \"all of the above\" approach to deal with climate change impacts.", "We've got to become energy independent for that reason.", "Also as we rely more and more on other countries

the cause is.", "The cause is manmade.", "That's the cause.", "That's why the polar icecap is melting.", "We have 3 percent of the world's oil reserves.", "We consume 25 percent of the oil in the

the technology by investing in clean coal technology.", "We should be creating jobs.", "John McCain has voted 20 times against funding alternative energy sources and thinks, I guess, the only answer is drill, drill, drill.", "In the meantime, we're all going to be in real trouble.", " I have always supported it.", "That's a fact.", " Yes, Senator McCain does support this.", "The chant is \"drill, baby, drill.\"", "They know that even in my own energy-producing state we have billions of barrels of oil and hundreds of trillions of cubic feet of clean, green natural gas.", "You even called drilling -- safe, environmentally-friendly drilling offshore as raping the outer continental shelf.", "There -- with new technology, with tiny footprints even on land, it is safe to drill and we need to do more of that.", "But also in that \"all of the above\" approach that Senator McCain supports, the alternative fuels will be tapped into: the nuclear, the clean coal.", "And I think you said it in a rope line, too, at one of your rallies.", "My record for 25 years has supported clean coal technology.", "A comment made in a rope line was taken out of context.", "Maybe he's for everything as long as it's not helped forward by the government.", "Maybe he's for everything if the free market takes care of it.", "But he voted 20 times against funding alternative energy sources.", "Absolutely positively.", "Look, in an Obama-Biden administration, there will be absolutely no distinction from a constitutional standpoint or a legal standpoint between a same-sex and a heterosexual couple.The fact of the matter is that under the Constitution we should be granted -- same-sex couples should be able to have visitation rights in the hospitals, joint ownership of property, life insurance policies, et cetera.", "That's only fair.", "It's what the Constitution calls for.", "And so we do support it.", "We do support making sure that committed couples in a same-sex marriage are guaranteed the same constitutional benefits as it relates to their property rights, their rights of visitation, their rights to insurance, their rights of ownership as heterosexual couples do.", " Well, not if it goes closer and closer towards redefining the traditional definition of marriage between one man and one woman.", "But in that tolerance also, no one would ever propose, not in a McCain-Palin administration, to do anything to prohibit, say, visitations in a hospital or contracts being signed, negotiated between parties.", "But I will tell Americans straight up that I don't support defining marriage as anything but between one man and one woman, and I think through nuances we can go round and round about what that actually means.", "But I'm being as straight up with Americans as I can in my non- support for anything but a traditional definition of marriage.", "Barack Obama nor I support redefining from a civil side what constitutes marriage.", "We do not support that.", "If that's the case, we really don't have a difference.", " Your question to him was whether he supported gay marriage and my answer is the same as his and it is that I do not.", " I am very thankful that we do have a good plan and the surge and the counterinsurgency strategy in Iraq that has proven to work, I am thankful that that is part of the plan implemented under a great American hero, General Petraeus, and pushed hard by another great American, Senator John McCain.I know that the other ticket opposed this surge, in fact, even opposed funding for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.", "Barack Obama voted against funding troops there after promising that he would not do so.", " And Senator Biden, I respected you when you called him out on that.", "You said that his vote was political and you said it would cost lives.", "And Barack Obama at first said he would not do that.", "We do have a plan for withdrawal.", "We don't need early withdrawal out of Iraq.", "We cannot afford to lose there or we're going to be no better off in the war in Afghanistan either.", "That's where we can be.", "And it would be a travesty if we quit now in Iraq.", "Barack Obama has offered a clear plan.", "Shift responsibility to the Iraqis over the next 16 months.", "Draw down our combat troops.", "Ironically the same plan that Maliki, the prime minister of Iraq and George Bush are now negotiating.", "The only odd man out here, only one left out is John McCain, number one.", "Number two, with regard to Barack Obama not -- quote -- \"funding the troops,\" John McCain voted the exact same way.", "John McCain voted against funding the troops because of an amendment he voted against had a timeline in it to draw down American troops.", "And John said I'm not going to fund the troops if in fact there's a timeline.", "Barack says it's time for them to spend their own money and have the 400,000 military we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve trained for them begin to take their own responsibility and gradually over six months -- 16 months, withdrawal.", "John McCain -- this is a fundamental difference between us, we will end this war.", "For John McCain, there's no end in sight to end this war, fundamental difference.", "We will end this war.", " Your plan is a white flag of surrender in Iraq and that is not what our troops need to hear today, that's for sure.", "And it's not what our nation needs to be able to count on.", "You guys opposed the surge.", "The surge worked.", "Barack Obama still can't admit the surge works.We'll know when we're finished in Iraq when the Iraqi government can govern its people and when the Iraqi security forces can secure its people.", "And our commanders on the ground will tell us when those conditions have been met.", "Now, you said regarding Senator McCain's military policies there, Senator Biden, that you supported a lot of these things.", "You also said that Barack Obama was not ready to be commander in chief.", "And I know again that you opposed the move that he made to try to cut off funding for the troops and I respect you for that.", "I don't know how you can defend that position now, but I know that you know especially with your son in the National Guard and I have great respect for your family also and the honor that you show our military.", "Anyone I think who can cut off funding for the troops after promising not to is another story.", " John McCain voted to cut off funding for the troops.", "Let me say that again: John McCain voted against an amendment containing $1 billion, $600 million that I had gotten to get MRAPS, those things that are protecting the governor's son and pray god my son and a lot of other sons and daughters.He voted against it.", "He voted against funding because he said the amendment had a time line in it to end this war, and he didn't like that.", "John McCain and Dick Cheney said when I was saying we would not be greeted as liberators, we would not - this war would take a decade, not a day, not a week, not six months, we would not be out of there quickly.", "John McCain was saying the Sunnis and Shias got along with each other without reading the history of the last 700 years.",

weapon would be very, very destabilizing.", "They are more than - they are not close to getting a nuclear weapon that's able to be deployed.", "So they're both very dangerous.", "They both would be game changers.", "John continues to tell us that the central war in the front on terror is in Iraq.", "I promise you, if an attack comes in the homeland, it's going to come as our security services have said, it is going to come from al Qaeda planning in the hills of Afghanistan and Pakistan.", "That's where they live.", "That's where they are.", "That's where it will come from.", "And right now that resides in Pakistan.", "A stable government needs to be established.", " Both are extremely dangerous, of course.", "And as for who termed that central war on terror being in Iraq, it was General Petraeus and al Qaeda, both leaders there and it's probably the only thing that they're ever going to agree on, but that it was a central war on terror is in Iraq.", "You don't have to believe me or John McCain on that.", "I would believe Petraeus and that leader of al Qaeda.An armed, nuclear armed especially, Iran is so extremely dangerous to consider.", "They cannot be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons period.", "Israel is in jeopardy of course when we're dealing with Ahmadinejad as a leader of Iran.", "Iran claiming that Israel is, he termed it, a stinking corpse, a country that should be wiped off the face of the earth.", "Now a leader like Ahmadinejad who is not sane or stable when he says things like that is not one whom we can allow to acquire nuclear energy, nuclear weapons.", "An issue like that taken up by a presidential candidate goes beyond naivete and goes beyond poor judgment.", " No, and Dr. Henry Kissinger especially.", "And that's what John McCain and I would engage in also.", "That is beyond bad judgment.", "That is dangerous.No, diplomacy is very important.", "First and foremost, that is what we would engage in.", "But diplomacy is hard work by serious people.", "It's lining out clear objectives and having your friends and your allies ready to back you up there and have sanctions lined up also before any kind of presidential summit would take place.", "That's just simply not true about Barack Obama.", "He did not say sit down with Ahmadinejad.", " The fact of the matter is, it surprises me that Senator McCain doesn't realize that Ahmadinejad does not control the security apparatus in Iran.", "Our friends and allies have been saying, Gwen, \"Sit down.", "Talk.", "Talk.\"", "Our friends and allies have been saying that, five secretaries of state, three of them Republicans.", "And John McCain has said he would go along with an agreement, but he wouldn't sit down.", "And look what President Bush did.", "After five years, he finally sent a high-ranking diplomat to meet with the highest-ranking diplomats in Iran, in Europe, to try to work out an arrangement.", "Our allies are on that same page.", "And if we don't go the extra mile on diplomacy, what makes you think the allies are going to sit with us?", "The last point I'll make, John McCain said as recently as a couple of weeks ago he wouldn't even sit down with the government of Spain, a NATO ally that has troops in Afghanistan with us now.", "I find that incredible.", " A two-state solution is the solution.", "We will support Israel.", "They succeeded with Jordan.", "They succeeded with Egypt.", "I'm sure that we're going to see more success there, also.", "It's got to be a commitment of the United States of America, though.", "And I can promise you, in

been an abject failure, this administration's policy.", "In fairness to Secretary Rice, she's trying to turn it around now in the seventh or eighth year.", "Hamas will win.", "You'll legitimize them.\"", "Hamas won.", "When we kicked -- along with France, we kicked Hezbollah out of Lebanon, I said and Barack said, \"Move NATO forces in there.", "Fill the vacuum, because if you don't know -- if you don't, Hezbollah will control it.\"", "Hezbollah is a legitimate part of the government in the country immediately to the north of Israel.", "The fact of the matter is, the policy of this

Lebanon, as well as in the Gaza Strip with Hamas.", "We will change this policy with thoughtful, real, live diplomacy that understands that you must back Israel in letting them negotiate, support their negotiation, and stand with them, not insist on policies like this administration has.", " No, I do not believe that it has been.", "But I'm so encouraged to know that we both love Israel, and I think that is a good thing to get to agree on, Senator Biden.", "I respect your position on that.No, in fact, when we talk about the Bush administration, there's a time, too, when Americans are going to say, \"Enough is enough with your ticket,\" on constantly looking backwards, and pointing fingers, and doing the blame game.", "There have been huge blunders in the war.", "There have been huge blunders throughout this administration, as there are with every administration.", "But for a ticket that wants to talk about change and looking into the future, there's just too much finger-pointing

aside.", "That's what John McCain has been known for in all these years.", "He has been the maverick.", "He has ruffled feathers.", "But I know, Senator Biden, you have respected him for that, and I respect you for acknowledging that.", "But change is coming.", "I haven't heard anything yet.I haven't heard how his policy is going to be different on Iran than George Bush's.", "I haven't heard how his policy is going to be different with Israel than George Bush's.", "I haven't heard how his policy in Afghanistan is going to be different than George Bush's.", "I haven't heard how his policy in

administration.", "And such a reckless, reckless comment and untrue comment, again, hurts our cause.", "That's not what we're doing there.", "We're fighting terrorists, and we're securing democracy,

need more troops.", "We need government-building.", "We need to spend more money on the infrastructure in Afghanistan.", "Look, we have spent more money -- we spend more money in three weeks on combat

infrastructure can work in Afghanistan.", "And those leaders who are over there, who have also been advising George Bush on this have not said anything different but that.", " Well, our commanding general did say that.", "The fact of the matter is that again, I'll just put in perspective, while Barack and I and Chuck Hagel and Dick Lugar have been calling for more money to help in Afghanistan, more troops in Afghanistan, John McCain was saying two years ago quote, \"The reason we don't read about Afghanistan anymore in the paper, it's succeeded.Barack Obama was saying we need more troops there.", "Again, we spend in three weeks on combat missions in Iraq, more than we spent in the entire time we have been in Afghanistan.", "That will change in a Barack Obama administration.", " I think the American public has the stomach for success.", "I admit I was the first one to recommend it.", "They saved tens of thousands of lives.", "And initially John McCain opposed it along with a lot of other people.", "But the end result was it worked.", "We took Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks, being told by everyone, I was told by everyone that this would mean that they had been fighting and killing each other for a thousand years, it would never work.There's a relatively stable government there now as there is in Kosovo.", "With regard to Iraq, I indicated that it would be a mistake to -- I gave the president the power.", "I voted for the power because he said he needed it not to go to war but to keep the United States, the UN in line, to keep sanctions on Iraq and not let them be lifted.", "I, along with Dick Lugar, before we went to war, said if we were to go to war without our allies, without the kind of support we need, we'd be there for a decade and it'd cost us tens of billions of dollars.", "John McCain said, no, it was going to be OK.", "I don't have the stomach for genocide when it comes to Darfur.", "We can now impose a no-fly zone.", "It's within our capacity.", "We can lead NATO if we're willing to take a hard stand.", "I've seen the suffering, thousands and tens of thousands have died and are dying.", "We should rally the world to act and we should demonstrate it by our own movement to provide the helicopters to get the 21,000 forces of the African Union in there now to stop this genocide.", " Oh, yeah, it's so obvious I'm a Washington outsider.", "And someone just not used to the way you guys operate.", "Because here you voted for the war and now you oppose the war.", "You're one who says, as so many politicians do, I was for it before I was against it or vice- versa.", "And I watched those debates, so I remember what those were all about.", "But as for as Darfur, we can agree on that also, the supported of the no-fly zone, making sure that all options are on the table there also.", "America is in a position to help.", "What I've done in my position to help, as the governor of a state that's pretty rich in natural resources, we have a $40 billion investment fund, a savings fund called the Alaska Permanent Fund.", "When I and others in the legislature found out we had some millions of dollars in Sudan, we called for divestment through legislation of those dollars to make sure we weren't doing anything that would be seen as condoning the activities there in Darfur.", "There is a line that should be drawn.", " The line that should be drawn is whether we A, first of all have the capacity to do anything about it number one.", "And number two, there are certain new lines that have to be drawn internationally.", "When a country engages in genocide, when a country engaging in harboring terrorists and will do nothing about it, at that point that country in my view and Barack's view forfeits their right to say you have no right to intervene at all.The truth of the matter is, though, let's go back to John McCain's strategy.", "I never supported John McCain's strategy on the war.", "John McCain said exactly what Dick Cheney said, go back and look at Barack Obama's statements and mine.", "Go look at joebiden.com, contemporaneously, held hearings in the summer before we went to war, saying if we went to war, we would not be greeted as liberator, we would have a fight between Sunnis and Shias, we would be tied down for a decade and cost us hundreds of billions of dollars.", "John McCain was saying the exact opposite.", "John McCain was lock- step with Dick Cheney at that point how this was going to be easy.", "So John McCain's strategy in this war, not just whether or not to go, the actual conduct of the war has been absolutely wrong from the outset.", " I beg to disagree with you, again, here on whether you supported Barack Obama or John McCain's strategies.", "Here again, you can say what you want to say a month out before people are asked to vote on this, but we listened to the debates.I think tomorrow morning, the pundits are going to start do the who said what at what time and we'll have proof of some of this, but, again, John McCain who knows how to win a war.", "Who's been there and he's faced challenges and he knows what evil is and knows what it takes to overcome the challenges here with our military.", "He knows to learn from the mistakes and blunders we have seen in the war in Iraq, especially.", "He will know how to implement the strategies, working with our commanders and listening to what they have to say, taking the politics out of these war issues.", "He'll know how to win a war.", " God forbid that would ever happen, it would be a national tragedy of historic proportions if it were to happen.But if it did, I would carry out Barack Obama's policies, his policies of reinstating the middle class, making sure they get a fair break, making sure they have access to affordable health insurance, making sure they get serious tax breaks, making sure we can help their children get to college, making sure there is an energy policy that leads us in the direction of not only toward independence and clean environment but an energy policy that creates 5 million new jobs, a foreign policy that ends this war in Iraq, a foreign policy that goes after the one mission the American public gave the president after 9/11, to get and capture or kill bin Laden and to eliminate al Qaeda.", "A policy that would in fact engage our allies in making sure that we knew we were acting on the same page and not dictating.", "And a policy that would reject the Bush Doctrine of preemption and regime change and replace it with a doctrine of prevention and cooperation and, ladies and gentlemen, this is the biggest ticket item that we have in this election.", "This is the most important election you will ever, ever have voted in, any of you, since 1932.", "A team of mavericks, of course we're not going to agree on 100 percent of everything.", "As we discuss ANWR there, at least we can agree to disagree on that one.", "I will keep pushing him on ANWR.", "What I would do also, if that were to ever happen, though, is to continue the good work he is so committed to of putting government back on the side of the people and get rid of the greed and corruption on Wall Street and in Washington.", "I think we need a little bit of reality from Wasilla Main Street there, brought to Washington, DC.", " So that people there can understand how the average working class family is viewing bureaucracy in the federal government and Congress, and the inaction of Congress.Just everyday, working-class Americans saying, you know, government, just get out of my way.", "Look, all you've got to do is go down Union Street with me in Wilmington or go to Katie's Restaurant or walk into Home Depot with me where I spend a lot of time and you ask anybody in there whether or not the economic and foreign policy of this administration has made them better off in the last eight years.", "And then ask them whether there's a single major initiative that John McCain differs with the president on.", "On taxes, on Iraq, on Afghanistan, on the whole question of how to help education, on the dealing with health care.Look, the people in my neighborhood, they get it.", "They get it.", "They know they've been getting the short end of the stick.", "So walk with me in my neighborhood, go back to my old neighborhood in Claymont, an old steel town or go up to Scranton with me.", "These people know the middle class has gotten the short end.", "The wealthy have done very well.", "Corporate America has been rewarded.", "It's time we change it.", "Barack Obama will change it.", " Say it ain't so, Joe, there you go again pointing backwards again.", "You prefaced your whole comment with the Bush administration.", "Now doggone it, let's look ahead and tell Americans what we have to plan to do for them in the future.", "I say, too, with education, America needs to be putting a lot more focus on that and our schools have got to be really ramped up in terms of the funding that they are deserving.", "Teachers needed to be paid more.", "I come from a house full of school teachers.", "My grandma was, my dad who is in the audience today, he's a schoolteacher, had been for many years.", "No Child Left Behind was implemented.", "It's not doing the job though.", "We need flexibility in No Child Left Behind.", "We need to put more of an emphasis on the profession of teaching.", "We need to make sure that education in either one of our agendas, I think, absolute top of the line.", "Of course we know what a vice president does.", "Of course, we know what a vice president does.", "And that's not only to preside over the Senate and will take that position very seriously also.", " Gwen, I hope we'll get back to education because I don't know any government program that John is supporting, not early education, more money for it.", "The reason No Child Left Behind was left behind was the money was left behind, we didn't fund it.", "I have a history of getting things done in the United States Senate.", "John McCain would acknowledge that.", "My record shows that on controversial issues.", "I would be the point person for the legislative initiatives in the United States Congress for our administration.", "I would also, when asked if I wanted a portfolio, my response was, no.", "But Barack Obama indicated to me he wanted me with him to help him govern.", "So every major decision he'll be making, I'll be sitting in the room to give him my best advice.", "He's president, not me, I'll give my best advice.", "And one of the things he said early on when he was choosing, he said he picked someone who had an independent judgment and wouldn't be afraid to tell him if he disagreed.", "That is sort of my reputation, as you know.", "So I look forward to working with Barack and playing a very constructive role in his presidency, bringing about the kind of change this country needs.", " Well, our founding fathers were very wise there in allowing through the Constitution much flexibility there in the Office of the Vice President.", "And we will do what is best for the American people in tapping into that position and ushering in an agenda that is supportive and cooperative with the president's agenda in that position.", "with McCain, not only as a governor, but earlier on as a mayor, as an oil and gas regulator, as a business owner.", "It is those years of experience on an executive level that will be put to good use in the White House also.", " Vice President Cheney has been the most dangerous vice president we've had probably in American history.", "The idea he doesn't realize that Article I of the Constitution defines the role of the vice president of the United States, that's the Executive Branch.", "He works in the Executive Branch.", "He should understand that.", "The Constitution is explicit.", "The only authority the vice president has from the legislative standpoint is the vote, only when there is a tie vote.", "He has no authority relative to the Congress.", "The idea he's part of the Legislative Branch is a bizarre notion invented by Cheney to aggrandize the power of a unitary executive and look where it has gotten us.", "It has been very dangerous.", "Being a mom, being one who is very concerned about a son in the war, about a special needs child, about kids heading off to college, how are we going to pay those tuition bills?", "About times and Todd and our marriage in our past where we didn't have health insurance and we know what other Americans are going through as they sit around the kitchen table and try to figure out, how are they going to pay out-of-pocket for health care?", "We've been there also so that connection was important.", "But even more important is that worldview that I share with John McCain.", "We are not perfect as a nation.", "But together, we represent a perfect ideal, and that is democracy and tolerance and freedom and equal rights.", "Those things that we stand for that can be put to good use as a force for good in this world.", " You're very kind suggesting my only Achilles heel is my lack of discipline.", " Others talk about my excessive passion.", "I'm not going to change.", "I have 35 years in public office.", "People can judge who I am.", "Wrote the crime bill, put 100,000 cops on the street, wrote the Violence Against Women Act, which John McCain voted against both of them, was the catalyst to change the circumstance in Bosnia, led by President Clinton, obviously.", "Look, I understand what it's like to be a single parent.", "When my wife and daughter died and my two sons were gravely injured, I understand what it's like as a parent to wonder what it's like if your kid's going to make it.", "I understand what it's like to sit around the kitchen table with a father who says, \"I've got to leave, champ, because there's no jobs here.", "I'm much better off than almost all Americans now.", "I get a good salary with the United States Senate.", "I live in a beautiful house that's my total investment that I have.", "So I -- I am much better off now.", "But the notion that somehow, because I'm a man, I don't know what it's like to raise two kids alone, I don't know what it's like to have a child you're not sure is going to -- is going to make it -- I understand.", "I understand, as well as, with all due respect, the governor or anybody else, what it's like for those people sitting around that kitchen table.", "They're looking for help.", "They're not looking for more of the same.", " People aren't looking for more of the same.", "They are looking for change.", "And John McCain has been the consummate maverick in the Senate over all these years.He's taken shots left and right from the other party and from within his own party, because he's had to take on his own party when the time was right, when he recognized it was time to put partisanship aside and just do what was right for the American people.", "That's what I've done as governor, also, take on my own party, when I had to, and work with both sides of the aisle, in my cabinet, appointing those who would serve regardless of party, Democrats, independents, Republicans, whatever it took to get the job done.", "Also, John McCain's maverick position that he's in, that's really prompt up to and indicated by the supporters that he has.", "Look at Lieberman, and Giuliani, and Romney, and Lingle, and all of us who come from such a diverse background of -- of policy and of partisanship, all coming together at this time, recognizing he is the man that we need to leave -- lead in these next four years, because these are tumultuous times.", "We have got to win the wars.", "We have got to get our economy back on track.", "We have got to not allow the greed and corruption on Wall Street anymore.", "And we have not got to allow the partisanship that has really been entrenched in Washington, D.C., no matter who's been in charge.", "When the Republicans were in charge, I didn't see a lot of progress there, either.", "When the Democrats, either, though, this last go- around for the last two years.", "Change is coming.", "And John McCain is the leader of that reform.", "He's been a maverick on some issues, but he has been no maverick on the things that matter to people's lives.", "He voted four out of five times for George Bush's budget, which put us a half a trillion dollars in debt this year and over $3 trillion in debt since he's got there.", "He has not been a maverick in providing health care for people.", "He has voted against -- he voted including another 3.6 million children in coverage of the existing health care plan, when he voted in the United States Senate.", "He's not been a maverick when it comes to education.", "He has not supported tax cuts and significant changes for people being able to send their kids to college.", "He's not been a maverick on the war.", "He's not been a maverick on virtually anything that genuinely affects the things that people really talk about around their kitchen table.", "He voted against even providing for what they call LIHEAP, for assistance to people, with oil prices going through the roof in the winter.", "So maverick he is not on the important, critical issues that affect people at that kitchen table.", " Yes, I can.", "When I got to the United States Senate and went on the Judiciary Committee as a young lawyer, I was of the view and had been trained in the view that the only thing that mattered was whether or not a nominee appointed, suggested by the president had a judicial temperament, had not committed a crime of moral turpitude, and was -- had been a good student.And it didn't take me long -- it was hard to change, but it didn't take me long, but it took about five years for me to realize that the ideology of that judge makes a big difference.", "That's why I led the fight against Judge Bork.", "Had he been on the court, I suspect there would be a lot of changes that I don't like and the American people wouldn't like, including everything from Roe v. Wade to issues relating to civil rights and civil liberties.", "And so that -- that -- that was one of the intellectual changes that took place in my career as I got a close look at it.", "The American people have a right to understand it and to know it.", "But I did change on that, and -- and I'm glad I did.", "But on the major principle things, no, there hasn't been something that I've had to compromise on, because we've always seemed to find a way to work together.", "Up there in Alaska, what we have done is, with bipartisan efforts, is work together and, again, not caring who gets the credit for what, as we accomplish things up there.", "And that's been just a part of the operation that I wanted to participate in.", "And that's what we're going to do in Washington, D.C., also, bring in both sides together.", "John McCain is known for doing that, also, in order to get the work done for the American people.", " Well, again, I believe John McCain, were he here -- and this is a dangerous thing to say in the middle of an election -- but he would acknowledge what I'm about to say.I have been able to work across the aisle on some of the most controversial issues and change my party's mind, as well as Republicans', because I learned a lesson from Mike Mansfield.", "He said, \"Joe, understand one thing.", "Everyone's sent here for a reason, because there's something in them

disagreed.", "I've questioned their judgment.", "I think that's why I have the respect I have and have been able to work as well as I've been able to have worked in the United States Senate.", "That's the fundamental change Barack Obama and I will be bring to this party, not questioning other people's motives.", " You do what I did as governor, and you appoint people regardless of party affiliation, Democrats, independents, Republicans.", "You -- you walk the walk; you don't just talk the talk.And even in my own family, it's a very diverse family.", "But the policies and the proposals have got to speak for themselves, also.", "And, again, voters on November 4th are going to have that choice to either support a ticket that supports policies that create jobs.", "You do that by lowering taxes on American workers and on our businesses.", "And you build up infrastructure, and you rein in government spending, and you make our -- our nation energy independent.", "Or you support a ticket that supports policies that will kill jobs by increasing taxes.", "And that's what the track record shows, is a desire to increase taxes, increase spending, a trillion-dollar spending proposal that's on the table.", "That's going to hurt our country, and saying no to energy independence.", "Clear choices on November 4th.", "This is such an honor for me.And I appreciate, too, Senator Biden, getting to meet you, finally, also, and getting to debate with you.", "And I would like more opportunity for this.", "I like being able to answer these tough questions without the filter, even, of the mainstream media kind of telling viewers what they've just heard.", "I'd rather be able to just speak to the American people like we just did.", "And it's so important that the American people know of the choices that they have on November 4th.", "I want to assure you that John McCain and I, we're going to fight for America.", "We're going to fight for the middle-class, average, everyday American family like mine.", "I've been there.", "I know what the hurts are.", "I know what the challenges are.", "And, thank God, I know what the joys are, too, of living in America.", "We are so blessed.", "And I've always been proud to be an American.", "And so has John McCain.", "We have to fight for our freedoms, also, economic and our national security freedoms.", "It was Ronald Reagan who said that freedom is always just one generation away from extinction.", "We don't pass it to our children in the bloodstream; we have to fight for it and protect it, and then hand it to them so that they shall do the same, or we're going to find ourselves spending our sunset years telling our children and our children's children about a time in America, back in the day, when men and women were free.", " Gwen, thank you for doing this, and the commission, and Governor, it really was a pleasure getting to meet you.Look, folks, this is the most important election you've ever voted in your entire life.", "No one can deny that the last eight years, we've been dug into a very deep hole here at home with regard to our economy, and abroad in terms of our credibility.", "And there's a need for fundamental change in our economic philosophy, as well as our foreign policy.", "And Barack Obama and I don't measure progress toward that change based on whether or not we cut more regulations and how well CEOs are doing, or giving another $4 billion in tax breaks to the Exxon Mobils of the world.", "We measure progress in America based on whether or not someone can pay their mortgage, whether or not they can send their kid to college, whether or not they're able to, when they send their child, like we have abroad -- or I'm about to, abroad -- and John has as well, I might add -- to fight, that they are the best equipped and they have everything they need.", "And when they come home, they're guaranteed that they have the best health care and the best education possible.", "You know, in the neighborhood I grew up in, it was all about dignity and respect.", "A neighborhood like most of you grew up in.", "And in that neighborhood, it was filled with women and men, mothers and fathers who taught their children if they believed in themselves, if they were honest, if they worked hard, if they loved their country, they could accomplish anything.", "We believed it, and we did.", "Ladies and gentlemen, my dad used to have an expression.", "He'd say, \"champ, when you get knocked down, get up.\"", "Well, it's time for America to get up together.", "America's ready, you're ready, I'm ready, and Barack Obama is ready to be the next president of the United States of America.", " Well first of all, I don't agree with Senator Kennedy that Cuba is lost and certainly China was lost when this Administration came into power in 1953.", "As I look at Cuba today, I believe that we are following the right course, a course which is difficult but a course which under the circumstance is the only proper one which will see that the Cuban people get a chance to realize their aspirations of progress through freedom and that they get that with our cooperation with the other organi- of the states in the Organization of American States.", "There were eleven dictators in South America and in Central America when we came in, in 1953.", "Today there are only three left including the one in Cuba.", "We think that's pretty good progress.", "Senator Kennedy also indicated with regard to Cuba that he thought that I had made a mistake when I was in Cuba in not calling for free elections in that country.", "Now I'm very surprised that Senator Kennedy, who is on the Foreign Relations Committee, would have made such a statement as this kind.", "As a matter of fact in his book, The Strategy for Peace, he took the right position.", "And that position is that the United States has a treaty - a treaty with all of the Organization of American States - which prohibits us from interfering in the internal affairs of any other state and prohibits them as well.", "There isn't any question but that we will defend our rights there.", "There isn't any question but that we will defend Guantanamo if it's attacked.", "There also isn't any question but that the free people of Cuba - the people who want to be free - are going to be supported and that they will attain their freedom.", "No, Cuba is not lost, and I don't think this kind of defeatist talk by Senator Kennedy helps the situation one bit.", " In the first place I've never suggested that Cuba was lost except for the present.", "In my speech last night I indicated that I thought that Cuba one day again would be free.", "Secondly, I did not criticize him for not calling for free elections.", "What I criticized was the failure of the Administration to use its great influence to persuade the Cuban government to hold free elections, particularly in 1957 and 1958.", "I hope some day it will rise; but I don't think it will rise if we continue the same policies toward Cuba that we did in recent years, and in fact towards all of Latin America - when we've almost ignored the needs of Latin America; we've beamed not a single Voice of America program in Spanish to all of Latin America in the last eight years, except for the three months of the Hungarian uh - revolution.", " Mr. Morgan, I suggested that if the United States felt that it could save the summit conference that it would have been proper for us to have expressed regrets.", "In my judgment that statement has been distorted uh - by Mr. Nixon and others in their debates around the country and in their discussions.", "The U-2 flights were proper from the point of view of protecting our security.", "But they were not in accordance with international law.", "The point that is always left out is the fact that we expressed regrets to Castro this winter; that we expressed regrets - the Eisenhower Administration expressed regrets - for a flight over Southern Russia in 1958.", "We expressed regrets for a flight over Eastern Germany under this Administration.", "The Soviet Union in 1955 expressed regrets to us over the Bering Sea incident.", "The Chinese Communists expressed regrets to us over a plane incident in 1956.", "That is the accepted procedure between nations; and my judgment is that we should follow the advice of Theodore Roosevelt: Be strong; maintain a strong position; but also speak softly.", "I believe that in those cases where international custom calls for the expression of a regret, if that would have kept the summit going, in my judgment it was a proper action.", "It's not appeasement.", "It's not soft.", "I believe we should be stronger than we now are.", "I believe we should have a stronger military force.", "I believe we should increase our strength all over the world.", "But I don't confuse words with strength; and in my judgment if the summit was useful, if it would have brought us closer to peace, that rather than the lie that we told - which has been criticized by all responsible people afterwards - it would have been far better for us to follow the common diplomatic procedure of expressing regrets and then try to move on.", "First of all, he's wrong in thinking th- er- even suggesting that Mr. Khrushchev might have continued the conference if we had expressed regrets.", "Second, he's wrong in the analogies that he makes.", "Whenever we do anything that's wrong, we can express regrets.", "But when the president of the United States is doing something that's right, something that is for the purpose of defending the security of this country against surprise attack, he can never express regrets or apologize to anybody, including Mr. Khrushchev.", "This seems to me is criticism that again is wrong on his part.", "We cannot afford an intelligence gap.", "And I just want to make my position absolutely clear with regard to getting intelligence information.", "I don't intend to see to it that the United States is ever in a position where, while we're negotiating with the Soviet Union, that we discontinue our intelligence effort.", "And I don't intend ever to express regrets to Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else if I'm doing something that has the support of the Congress and that is right for the purpose of protecting the security of the United States.", " My intentions in the field of civil rights have been spelled out in the Republican platform.", "I think we have to make progress first in the field of employment.", "Certainly I think all of us agree that when anybody has a government contract, certainly the money that is spent under that contract ought to be disbursed equally without regard to the race or creed or color of the individual who is to be employed.", "Second, in the field of schools, we believe that there should be provisions whereby the federal government would give assistance to those districts who do want to integrate their schools.", "That of course was rejected as was the government contracts provision by the special session of the Congress to - in which Mr. Kennedy was quite active.", "And then as far as other areas are concerned, I think that we have to look to presidential leadership.", "I've heard them explain - try to explain - how they tell their children how they can go into a store and buy a loaf of bread but then can't go into that store and sit at the counter and get a Coca Cola.", "This is wrong, and we have to do something about it.", "So, under the circumstances, what do we do?", "Well what we do is what the Attorney-General of the United States did under the direction of the President: call in the owners of chain stores and get them to take action.", "Not because I am preaching to the people of the South because this isn't just a Southern problem; it's a Northern problem and a Western problem; it's a problem for all of us.", "I do it because it's the responsibility of leadership, I do it because we have to solve this problem together.", " Well, Mr. Nixon hasn't discussed the two basic questions: what is going to be done and what will be his policy on implementing the Supreme Court decision of 1954?", "Giving aid to schools technically that are trying to carry out the decision is not the great question.", "Secondly, what's he going to do to provide fair employment?", "He's been the head of the Committee on Government Contracts that's carried out two cases, both in the District of Columbia.", "He has not indicated his support of an attempt to provide fair employment practices around the country, so that everyone can get a job regardless of their race or color.", "These are the great questions: equality of education in school.", "These are the questions in these areas that the North and South, East and West are entitled to know.", "What will be the leadership of the president in these areas to provide equality of opportunity for employment?", "Equality of opportunity in the field of housing, which could be done on all federal supported housing by a stroke of the president's pen.", "What will be done to provide equality of education in all sections of the United States?", "Those are the questions to which the president must establish a moral tone and moral leadership.", "And I can assure you that if I'm elected president we will do so.", " Well let me say that I think that the president operates in a number of different areas.", "First, as a legislative leader.", "And as I just said that I believe that the passage of the so-called Title Three, which gives the Attorney General the power to protect Constitutional rights in those cases where it's not possible for the person involved to bring the suit.", "Secondly, as an executive leader.", "There have been only six cases brought by this Attorney General under the voting bill passed in 1957 and the voting bill passed in 1960.", "The right to vote is basic.", "I do not believe that this Administration has implemented those bills which represent the will of the majority of the Congress on two occasions with vigor.", "Thirdly, I don't believe that the government contracts division is operated with vigor.", "Everyone who does business with the government should have the opportunity to make sure that they do not practice discrimination in their hiring.", "And that's in all sections of the United States.", "And then fourthly, as a moral leader.", "There is a very strong moral basis for this concept of equality of opportunity.", "We are in a very difficult time.", "We need all the talent we can get.", "We are a goldfish bowl before the world.", "We have to practice what we preach.", "We set a very high standard for ourselves.", "The Communists do not.", "They set a low standard of materialism.", "I believe the president of the United States should indicate it.", "Now lastly, I believe in the case of Little Rock.", "I would have hoped that the president of the United States would have been possible for him to indicate it clearly that uh - the Supreme Court decision was going to be carried out.", "I would have hoped that it would have been possible to use marshals to do so.", "But it wou- uh - evidently uh - under the handling of the case it was not.", "I would hope an incident like that would not happen.", "I think if the president is responsible, if he consults with those involved, if he makes it clear that the Supreme Court decision is going to be carried out in a way that the Supreme Court planned - with deliberate speed - then in my judgment, providing he's behind action, I believe we can make uh - progress.", "And I believe on this great moral issue he should speak out and give his views clearly.", " Senator Kennedy has expressed some hopes in this field, hopes which I think all Americans would share who want some problem - some progress in this area.", "When he selected his vice presidential running mate, he selected a man who had voted against most of these proposals and who opposes them at the present time.", "I selected a man who stands with me in this field and who will talk with me and work with me on it.", "And yet that very committee of which I am chairman has been handicapped by the fact that we have not had adequate funds; we have not had adequate powers; we haven't had an adequate staff.", "What we need is action.", "And in the field of executive leadership, I can say that I believe it's essential that the president of the United States not only set the tone but he also must lead; he must act as he talks.", " Mr. Morgan, no matter how well we're doing in the cold war, we're not doing as well as we should.", "And that will always be the case as long as the Communists are on the international scene, in the aggressive tac- uh - tendencies that they presently are following.", "Now as far as the present situation is concerned, I think it's time that we nail a few of these distortions about the United States that have been put out.", "I would suggest that after Premier Kush- Khrushchev's uh - performance in the United Nations, compared with President Eisenhower's eloquent speech, that at the present time Communist prestige in the world is at an all-time low and American prestige is at an all-time high.", "Now that, of course, is just one factor, but it's a significant one.", "There were seventy votes for our position and none for theirs.", "Look at the votes in the United Nations over the past seven and a half years.", "That's a test of prestige.", "Every time the United States has been an one side and they've been on the other side, our position has been sustained.", "Now looking to what we ought to do in the future.", "In this cold war we have to recognize where it is being fought and then we have to develop programs to deal with it.", "It's being fought primarily in Asia, in Africa, and in Latin America.", "What tools do we need to fight us?", "Well we need, for example, economic assistance; we need technical assistance; we need exchange; we need programs of diplomatic and other character which will be effective in that area.", "They also have cut four billion dollars off of mutual security in these last six years.", "They also have cut two billion dollars off of defense.", "Now when they talk about our record here, it is well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well.", "So let me summarize by saying this: I'm not satisfied with what we're doing in the cold war because I believe we have to step up our activities and launch an offensive for the minds and hearts and souls of men.", "It must be economic; it must be technological; above all it must be ideological.", "But we've got to get help from the Congress in order to do this.", " Of course Mr. Nixon is wholly inaccurate when he says that the Congress has not provided more funds in fact than the President recommended for national defense.", "Nineteen fifty-three we tried to put an appropriation of five billion dollars for our defenses.", "We all know about the vote held this week - of the five neutralists - and it was generally regarded as a defeat for the United States.", "We have not maintained our position and our prestige.", "Governor Rockefeller has been far more critical in June of our position in the world than I have been.", "We have been wholly indifferent to Latin America until the last few months.", "meeting a condemnation of Russian infiltration of Cuba.", "And therefore we passed an authorization - not an aid bill - which was the first time, really, since the Inter-American Bank which was founded a year ago was developed, that we really have looked at the needs of Latin America; that we have associated ourselves with those people.", "Secondly, I believe that in the ca- that it's far better for the United States, instead of concentrating our aid, particularly in the underdeveloped world, on surplus military equipment - we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into Laos.", "We paid more military aid, more aid into Laos po- per - per person than in any country in the world and we ought to know now that Laos is moving from neutralism in the direction of the Communists.", "I believe instead of doing that, we should concentrate our aid in long-term loans which these people can pay back either in hard money or in local currency.", "This permits them to maintain their self-respect.", "It permits us to make sure that the projects which are invested in are going to produce greater wealth.", "And I believe that in cases of India and Africa and Latin America that this is where our emphasis should be.", "I would strengthen the Development Loan Fund.", "And Senator Fulbright, Senator Humphrey and I tried to do that.", "We tried to provide an appropriation of a billion and a half for five years, on a long-term loan basis, which this Administration opposed.", "And unless we're ready to carry out programs like that in the sixties, this battle for economic survival which these people are waging are going to be lost.", "And if India should lose her battle, with thirty-five per cent of the people of the underdeveloped world within her borders, then I believe that the balance of power could move against us.", "I think the United States can afford to do these things.", "I think that we could not afford not to do these things.", "This goes to our survival.", "And here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if it's developing its economy to the fullest - which we are not now - in my judgment, we'll have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas.", "I believe we can do it.", "If we build our economy the way we should, we can afford to do these things and we must do it.", " Senator Kennedy has put a great deal of stress on the necessity for economic assistance.", "This is important.", "But it's also tremendously important to bear in mind that when you pour in money without pouring in technical assistance at w- as well, that you have a disastrous situation.", "We need to step up exchange; we need to step up technical assistance so that trained people in these newly developing countries can operate the economies.", "We also have to have in mind something else with regard to this whole situation in the world, and that is: that as America moves forward, we not only must think in terms of fighting Communism, but we must also think primarily in terms of the interests of these countries.", "We must associate ourselves with their aspirations.", "We must let them know that the great American ideals - of independence, of the right of people to be free, and of the right to progress - that these are ideals that belong not to ourselves alone, but they belong to everybody.", "This we must get across to the world.", "And we can't do it unless we do have adequate funds for, for example, information which has been cut by the Congress, adequate funds for technical assistance.", "The other point that I would make with regard to economic assistance and technical assistance is that the United States must not rest its case here alone.", "We must not meet the Communists purely in the field of gross atheistic materialism.", "We must stand for our ideals.", " To combat unemployment we first must concentrate on the very areas to which you refer - the so-called depressed areas.", "Now in the last Congress - the special session of the Congress - there was a bill: one by the President, one by Senator Kennedy and members of his party.", "On the other hand we found that the bill got into the legislative difficulties and consequently no action was taken.", "So point one, at the highest priority we must get a bill for depressed areas through the next Congress.", "I have made recommendations on that and I have discussed them previously and I will spell them out further in the campaign.", "Second, as we consider this problem of unemployment, we have to realize where it is.", "In analyzing the figures we will find that our unemployment exists among the older citizens; it exists also among those who are inadequately trained; that is, those who do not have an adequate opportunity for education.", "It also exists among minority groups.", "If we're going to combat unemployment, then, we have to do a better job in these areas.", "Now finally, with regard to the whole problem of combating recession, as you call it, we must use the full resources of the government in these respects: one, we must see to it that credit is expanded as we go into any recessionary period - and understand, I do not believe we're going into a recession.", "I believe this economy is sound and that we're going to move up.", "But second, in addition to that, if we do get into a recessionary period we should move on that part of the economy which is represented by the private sector, and I mean stimulate that part of the economy that can create jobs - the private sector of the economy.", "This means through tax reform and if necessary tax cuts that will stimulate more jobs.", "I favor that rather than massive federal spending programs which will come into effect usually long after you've passed through the recessionary period.", "So we must use all of these weapons for the purpose of combating recession if it should come.", "But I do not expect it to come.", " Well Mr. Nixon has stated the record inaccurately in regard to the depressed area bill.", "I'm very familiar with it.", "We passed a bill again this year in the cong- in the Senate and it died in the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives.", "Let me make it very clear that the bill that Mr. Nixon talked about did not mention Wilkes-Barre or Scranton; it did not mention West Virginia.", "Our bill was far more effective.", "The bill introduced and erd- sponsored by Senator Douglas was far more effective in trying to stimulate the economy of those areas.", "Secondly, he has mentioned the problem of our older citizens.", "I cannot still understand why this Administration and Mr. Nixon oppose putting medical care for the aged under Social Security to give them some security.", "Third, I believe we should step up the use of our surplus foods in these areas until we're able to get the people back to work.", "Five cents a day - that's what the food package averages per person.", "Fourthly, I believe we should not carry out a hard money, high interest rate policy which helped intensify certainly the recession of 1958, and I think helped bring the slow-down of 1960.", "If we move into a recession in sixty-one, then I would agree that we have to put more money into the economy, and it can be done by either one of the two methods discussed.", "One is by ex- the programs such as aid to education.", "The other would be to make a judgment on what's the most effective tax program to stimulate our economy.", "The question is what we're going to do in the future.", "I've been critical of this Administration and I've been critical of the President.", "I believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined.", "Now what is the issue is what we're going to do in the future.", "Now that's an issue between Mr. Nixon and myself.", "I disagree.", "And I believe the American people have to make the choice on November eighth between the view of whether we have to move ahead faster, whether what we're doing now is not satisfactory, whether we have to build greater strength at home and abroad and Mr. Nixon's view.", "That's the great issue.", "President Eisenhower moves from the scene on January twentieth and the next four years are the critical years.", "And that's the debate.", "That's the argument between Mr. Nixon and myself and on that issue the American people have to make their judgment and I think it's a important judgment.", "I think in many ways this election is more important than any since 1932, or certainly almost any in this century.", "In Africa, the United States has ignored Latin uh - Africa.", "We gave more scholarships to the Congo - this summer we offered them - than we've given to all of Africa the year before.", "We've been uh - having a very clear decision in the last eight years.", "Mr. Nixon has been part of that Administration.", "He's had experience in it.", "And I believe this Administration has not met its responsibilities in the last eight years, that our power relative to that of the Communists is declining, that we're facing a very hazardous time in the sixties, and unless the United States begin to move here - unless we start to go ahead - I don't believe that we're going to meet our responsibility to our own people or to the cause of freedom.", "I think the choice is clear and it involves the future.", " Well first of all, I think Senator Kennedy should make up his mind with regard to my responsibility.", "In our first debate he indicated that I had not had experience or at least uh - had not participated significantly in the making of the decisions.", "I have participated in the discussions leading to the decisions in this Administration.", "I'm proud of the record of this Administration.", "I don't stand on it because it isn't something to stand on but something to build on.", "Now looking at Senator Kennedy's credentials: he is suggesting that he will move America faster and further than I will.", "But what does he offer?", "He offers retreads of programs that failed.", "I submit to you that as you look at his programs, his program for example with regard to the Federal Reserve and uh - free money or loose money uh - high - low interest rates, his program in the economic field generally are the programs that were adopted and tried during the Truman Administration.", "And when we compare the economic progress of this country in the Truman Administration with that of the Eisenhower Administration, we find that in every index there has been a tr- great deal more performance and more progress in this Administration than in that one.", "I say the programs and the leadership that failed then is not the program and the leadership that America needs now.", "I say that the American people don't want to go back to those policies.", "And incidentally if Senator Kennedy disagrees, he should indicate where he believes those policies are different from those he's advocating today.", "It would not be appropriate for me to do so.", "We must not build up the hopes of the world and then dash them as was the case in Paris.", "There, Mr. Khrushchev came to that conference determined to break it up.", "Now, if we're going to have another summit conference, there must be negotiations at the diplomatic level - the ambassadors, the Secretaries of State, and others at that level - prior to that time, which will delineate the issues and which will prepare the way for the heads of state to meet and make some progress.", "Otherwise, if we find the heads of state meeting and not making progress, we will find that the cause of peace will have been hurt rather than helped.", " I have no disagreement with the Vice President's position on that.", "That before we go into the summit, before we ever meet again, I think it's important that the United States build its strength; that it build its military strength as well as its own economic strength.", "If we negotiate from a position where the power balance or wave is moving away from us, it's extremely difficult to reach a successful decision on Berlin as well as the other questions.", "Now the next president of the United States in his first year is going to be confronted with a very serious question on our defense of Berlin, our commitment to Berlin.", "It's going to be a test of our nerve and will.", "It's going to be a test of our strength.", "On the question of the summit, I agree with the position of Mr. Nixon.", "I would not meet Mr. Khrushchev unless there were some agreements at the secondary level - foreign ministers or ambassadors - which would indicate that the meeting would have some hope of success, or a useful exchange of ideas.", " Well I don't think that in the winter of sixty-one under present economic conditions, it uh - a - uh - tax uh - increase would be desirable.", "In fact, it would be deflationary; it would cause great unemployment; it would cause a real slowdown in our economy.", "If it ever becomes necessary, and is wise economically and essential to our security, I would have no hesitancy in suggesting a tax increase or any other policy which would defend the United States.", "I have talked in every speech about the fact that these are going to be very difficult times in the nineteen-sixties and that we're going to have to meet our responsibilities as citizens.", "I'm talking about a national mood.", "I'm talking about our willingness to bear any burdens in order to maintain our own freedom and in order to meet our freedom around the globe.", "We don't know what the future's going to bring.", "But I would not want anyone to elect me uh - president of the United States - or vote for me - under the expectation that life would be easier if I were elected.", "That's how the United States began to prepare for its great actions in World War II and in the post-war period.", "If we're moving ahead, if we're providing a viable economy, if our people have sufficient resources so that they can consume what we produce; then this country's on the move, then we're stronger, then we set a better example to the world.", "So we have the problem of not only building our own uh - military strength and extending uh - our policies abroad, we have to do a job here at home.", "So I believe that the policies that I recommend came under the general heading of strengthening the United States.", "We're using our steel capacity fifty-five per cent today.", "We're not able to consume what we're able to produce at a time when the Soviet Union is making great economic gains.", "And all I say is, I don't know what the sixties will bring - except I think they will bring hard times in the uh - international sphere; I hope we can move ahead here at home in the United States; I'm confident we can do a far better job of mobilizing our economy and resources in the United States.", "And I merely say that they - if they elect me president, I will do my best to carry the United States through a difficult period; but I would not want people to elect me because I promised them the easy, soft life.", "I think it's going to be difficult; but I'm confident that this country can meet its responsibilities.", " Well I think we should be no - under no illusions whatever about what the responsibilities of the American people will be in the sixties.", "Our expenditures for defense, our expenditures for mutual security, our expenditures for economic assistance and technical assistance are not going to get less.", "In my opinion they're going to be de- be greater.", "I think it may be necessary that we have more taxes.", "I hope not.", "I hope we can economize elsewhere so that we don't have to.", "But I would have no hesitation to ask the American people to pay the taxes even in l961 - if necessary - to maintain a sound economy and also to maintain a sound dollar.", "I think I should also add that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, if he intends to carry out his platform - the one adopted in Los Angeles - it is just impossible for him to make good on those promises without raising taxes or without having a rise in t- prices or both.", "The platform suggests that it can be done through economic growth; that it can be done, in effect, with mirrors.", "But it isn't going to be working that way.", "You can't add billions of dollars to our expenditures and not pay for it.", "After all, it isn't paid for by my money, it isn't paid for by his, but by the people's money.", "And as I pointed out in 1952, I made it very clear that as far as the Korean War was concerned, that I felt that the decision to go into the war in Korea was right and necessary.", "What I criticized were the policies that made it necessary to go to Korea.", "In the Truman Administration, six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain including the satellite countries of Eastern Europe and Communist China.", "In this Administration we've stopped them at Quemoy and Matsu; we've stopped them in Indochina; we've stopped them in Lebanon; we've stopped them in other parts of the world.", "I would also like to point out that as far as Senator Kennedy's comments are concerned, I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks we're wrong.", "But he has a responsibility to be accurate, and not to misstate the case.", "I don't think he should say that our prestige is at an all-time low.", "I think this is very harmful at a time Mr. Khrushchev is here - harmful because it's wrong.", "I don't think it was helpful when he suggested - and I'm glad he's corrected this to an extent - that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night in the United States.", "Now this just wasn't true.", "Now, there are people who go to bed hungry in the United States - far less, incidentally, than used to go to bed hungry when we came into power at the end of the Truman Administration.", "But the thing that is right about the United States, it should be emphasized, is that less people go to bed hungry in the United States than in any major country in the world.", "We're the best fed; we're the best clothed, with a better distribution of this world's goods to all of our people than any people in history.", "Now, in pointing out the things that are wrong, I think we ought to emphasize America's strengths.", "It isn't necessary to - to run America down in order to build her up.", "Now so that we get it absolutely clear: Senator Kennedy must as a candidate - as I as a candidate in fifty-two - criticize us when we're wrong.", "And he's doing a very effective job of that, in his way.", "And I have a responsibility to correct him every time he misstates the case; and I intend to continue to do so.", "Now I've seen a good many hundreds of thousands of people who are uh - not adequately fed.", "You can't tell me that a surplus food distribution of five cents po- per person - and that n- nearly six million Americans receiving that - is adequate.", "I believe that we should not compare what our figures may be to India or some other country that has serious problems but to remember that we are the most prosperous country in the world and that these people are not getting adequate food.", "And they're not getting in many cases adequate shelter.", "And we ought to try to meet the problem.", "Secondly, Mr. Nixon has continued to state - and he stated it last week - these fantastic figures of what the Democratic budget would c- uh - platform would cost.", "They're wholly inaccurate.", "I said last week I believed in a balanced budget.", "Unless there was a severe recession - and after all the worst unbalanced budget in history was in 1958, twelve billion dollars - larger than in any Administration in the history of the United States.", "So that I believe that on this subject we can balance the budget unless we have a national emergency or unless we have a severe recession.", " Well, the United States uh - has on occasion attempted uh - mostly in the middle fifties, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to pull his troops back to Formosa.", "I believe strongly in the defense of Formosa.", "We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it's attacked.", "We say we will defend it if it's part of a general attack on Formosa.", "But it's extremely difficult to make that judgment.", "Now, Mr. Herter in 1958, when he was Under Secretary of State, said they were strategically undefensible.", "Admirals Spruance and Callins in 1955 said that we should not attempt to defend these islands, in their conference in the Far East.", "General Ridgway has said the same thing.", "I believe that when you get into a w- if you're going to get into war for the defense of Formosa, it ought to be on a clearly defined line.", "One of the problems, I think, at the time of South Korea was the question of whether the United States would defend it if it were attacked.", "I believe that we should defend Formosa.", "We should come to its defense.", "Secondly, I would not suggest the withdrawal at the point of the Communist gun.", "It is a decision finally that the Nationalists should make and I believe that we should consult with them and attempt to work out a plan by which the line is drawn at the island of Formosa.", "It leaves a hundred miles between the sea.", "But with General Ridgway, Mr. Herter, General Collins, Admiral Spruance and many others, I think it's unwise to take the chance of being dragged into a war which may lead to a world war over two islands which are not strategically defensible, which are not, according to their testimony, essential to the defense of Formosa.", "I think that uh - we should protect our commitments.", "I believe strongly we should do so in Berlin.", "I believe strongly we should d- do so in Formosa and I believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security we've guaranteed.", "But I do not believe that that line in case of war should be drawn on those islands but instead on the island of Formosa.", "And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa, it's been my judgment ever since 1954, at the time of the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Far East, that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself.", " I disagree completely with Senator Kennedy on this point.", "I remember in the period immediately before the Korean War, South Korea was supposed to be indefensible as well.", "Generals testified to that.", "And Secretary Acheson made a very famous speech at the Press Club, early in the year that k- Korean War started, indicating in effect that South Korea was beyond the defense zone of the United States.", "I suppose it was hoped when he made that speech that we wouldn't get into a war.", "But it didn't mean that.", "We had to go in when they came in.", "Now I think as far as Quemoy and Matsu are concerned, that the question is not these two little pieces of real estate - they are unimportant.", "It isn't the few people who live on them - they are not too important.", "It's the principle involved.", "These two islands are in the area of freedom.", "The Nationalists have these two islands.", "We should not uh - force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists.", "In my opinion this is the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for America in Korea.", "I am against it.", "I would never tolerate it as president of the United States, and I will hope that Senator Kennedy will change his mind if he should be elected.", " Because that's the way we elect a president in this country, and it's the way we should.", "It's what we are.", "It's our whole lives.", "It's what we stand for.", "It's what we believe.", "And consequently, I don't think it's enough to go before Republican audiences - and I never do - and say, \"Look, vote for me because I'm a Republican.\"", "I don't think it's enough for Senator Kennedy to go before the audiences on the Democratic side and say, \"Vote for me because I'm a Democrat.\"", "That isn't enough.", "What's involved here is the question of leadership for the whole free world.", "Now that means the best leadership.", "It may be Republican, it may be Democratic.", "But the people are the ones that determine it.", "The people have to make up their minds.", "And I believe the people, therefore, should be asked to make up their minds not simply on the basis of, \"Vote the way your grandfather did; vote the way your mother did.\"", "I think the people should put America first, rather than party first.", "They will move her forward faster, and they will move her more surely than in his program.", "This is what I deeply believe.", "I'm sure he believes just as deeply that his will move that way.", "I suggest, however, that in the interest of fairness that he could give me the benefit of also believing as he believes.", " Well, let me say I do think that parties are important in that they tell something about the program and something about the man.", "The Democratic party in this century has stood for something.", "It has stood for progress; it has stood for concern for the people's welfare.", "The Republican party has produced McKinley and Harding, Coolidge, Dewey, and Landon.", "They do stand for something.", "They stand for a whole different approach to the problems facing this country at home and abroad.", "What I would propose, and I proposed it way back in March when I was a candidate in my own state of Illinois, I proposed $11.3 billion, specifically, in cuts in the Federal budget.", "I think we've got to have fiscal restraint.", " fiscal restraint, I think is necessary.", " I believe that the only unpopular measures, actually, that could be, or would be applied, would be unpopular with the government, and with those.", "perhaps, some special interest groups who are tied closely to government.", "I believe that inflation today is caused by government simply spending more than government takes in, at the same time that government has imposed upon business and industry, from the shopkeeper on the corner to the biggest industrial plant in America, countless harassing regulations and punitive taxes that have reduced productivity at the same time they have increased the cost of production.", "And when you are reducing productivity at the same time that you are turning out printing-press money in excessive amounts, you're causing inflation.", "And it isn't really higher prices, it's just, you are reducing the value of the money.", "You are robbing the American people of their savings.", "But I don't see where it is inflationary to have people keep more of their earnings and spend it, and it isn't inflationary for government to take that money away from them and spend it on the things it wants to spend it on.", "conservative projections out for the next five years, that indicates that this plan would, by 1983, result in a balanced budget.", "I say that because I think, this year, we will send $90 billion out of this country to pay for imported oil, even though that.", "those imports have been reduced.", "And since I first made that proposal 15 months ago, the price of gasoline, which was then $.80, has gone up to about $1.30.", "In other words, we've had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country - or much of it - into the pockets of OPEC oil producers.", "Whereas I have proposed we ought to take.", "put that tax on here at home, reduce our consumption of that imported oil.", "Recycle those proceeds, then, back into the pockets of the American workers by reducing their tax payments.", "their Social Security tax payments by 50%.", "That, I think, in addition, would be an anti-inflationary measure that would strengthen the economy of this country.", " Well, I cannot see where a $.50 a gallon tax applied to gasoline would have changed the price of gasoline.", "It would still have gone up as much as it has, and the $.50 would be added on top of that.", "Fifteen months ago, he was a cosigner and advocating the very tax cut that I am proposing, and said that that would be a forward step in fighting inflation, and that it would be beneficial to the working people of this country.", " Well, I believe that conservation, at course, is worthy in and of itself.", "Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and I'm for it.", "To say that we are limited, and at a dangerous point in this country with regard to energy, I think, is to ignore the fact.", "The fact is, that in today's oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used.", "But it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground.", "And this is known oil reserves, known supplies.", "There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago.", "We have a coal supply that is equal to 50% of the world's coal supply, good for centuries, in this country.", "We have nuclear power, which, I believe, with the safest.", "the most stringent of safety requirements, could meet our energy needs for the next couple of decades while we go forward exploring the areas of solar power and other forms of energy that might be renewable and that would not be exhaustible.", "All of these things can be done.", "When you stop and think that we are only drilling on 2%.", "have leased only 2% of the possible.", "That we are, indeed, an energy-rich nation.", "all we have to do is to get the Government off the back of the oil industry, and that's going to be enough.", "and that's simply why I proposed, 15 months ago, the emergency excise tax on gasoline that I did.", "But at the same time, I think it's going to take a dramatic measure of that kind to convince the American people that we will have to reduce the use of the private automobile.", "We simply cannot have people sitting one behind the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams going in and out of our great cities.", "We are going to have to resort to van pooling, to car pooling.", "I think that, with respect to housing, when we are consuming, even though our per capita income today is about the same as that of the Federal Republic of Germany, we are consuming about, by a factor of two, the amount of energy that they consume in that country.", "According to one study that was published a short time ago - the Harvard Business School study - indicated that just in the commercial sector alone of the economy, we could save between 30% and 40% of the energy that we consume in this country today.", "So I think, yes, we will have to change in a very appreciable way, some of the lifestyles that we now enjoy.", "That is the same Government that, in 1920, told us we only had enough oil left for 13 years, and 19 years later, told us we only had enough left for another 15 years.", "As for saving energy and conserving, the American people haven't been doing badly at that.", "Because in industry today, we're producing more, over the last several years, and at 12% less use of energy than we were back in about 1973.", "And motorists are using 8% less than they were back at that time of the oil embargo.", "So, I think we are proving that we can go forward with conservation and benefit from that.", "But also, I think it is safe to say that we do have sources of energy that have not yet been used or found.", " Mr. Greenberg, I think my opponent in this debate tonight is overlooking one other very important fact.", "And that is, that we cannot look at this as simply a national problem.", "Even though it's true that, perhaps, between now and the end of the decade, our total consumption of oil may not increase by more than, perhaps, a million or 2 million barrels of oil a day.", "The rest of the Western world, we are told, may see its consumption increase from 51 million barrels to about 66 million.", "And that additional 15 million barrels is going to cause scarcity.", "I think that conservation - I think that a change in lifestyles - is necessary, and we had better begin to plan for that now rather than later.", " Mr. Corddry, I am well aware of the present deficiencies in the Armed Forces of this country.", "When you have a report, as we did recently, that six out of 10 CONUS Divisions in this country - Continental United States Army Divisions - simply could not pass a readiness test: that two out of three divisions that were to be allocated to the so-called Rapid Deployment Force could not meet a readiness test.", "And in most cases, that failure to meet the test was because of a lack of manning requirements, an inability to fill many of the slots in those divisions.", "Yes, I have seen figures that indicate that perhaps as of September, 1980 - this very month - that there is a shortage of about 104,000 in the ranks between E-4 and E-9.", "And there were reports.", "public reports not long ago about ships that could not leave American ports because of a lack of crews.", "I talked to one of the leading former chiefs of Naval operations in my office a few weeks ago, who told me about 25,000 Chief Petty Officers being short.", "But, I think that that is clearly related to the fact that, going back to the time when the all-volunteer Army was created in 1973 - and I worked hard for it and supported it - we simply have failed to keep pace with the cost of living.", "And today, on the average, the average serviceman is at least 15% - and I happen to think that's a very modest estimate - 15% below what has happened to the cost of living over that period of time.", "And as a result, the families of some of our young servicemen are on food stamps today.", "And I think that's shocking; it's shameful.", "I. too, believe in the voluntary military.", "As a matter of fact, today the shortages of non-commissioned officers that John mentioned are such that if we tried to have a draft today, we wouldn't have the non-commissioned officers to train the draftees.", "I believe the answer lies in just recognizing human nature and how we make everything else work in this country, when we want it to work.", "Recognize that we have a voluntary military.", "We are asking for men and women to join the military as a career, and we're asking them to deal with the most sophisticated of equipment.", "And a young man is out there on a $1 billion carrier in charge of the maintenance of a $20 million aircraft, working 100 hours a week at times, and he's earning less for himself and his family, while he's away from his family, than he could earn if he were in one of the most menial jobs, working 40 hours a week here at home.", "As an aid to enlistment.", "we had an aid - 46% of the people who enlisted in the voluntary military up until 1977 said they did so for one particular reason, the G.I.", "Bill of Rights - the fact that, by serving in the military, they could provide for a future college education.", "In 1977, we took that away from the military.", "That meant immediately 46% of your people that were signing up had no reason for signing up.", "Along with this, I think we need something else that has been allowed to deteriorate.", "We need a million-man active reserve that could be called up on an instant's notice, and that would be also trained, ready to use that type of equipment.", "Both of these, I think, would respond to the proper kind of incentives that we could offer these people.", "I must say that I think I have better opportunity, however, of finding the necessary funds to pay what, admittedly, will be very, very substantial sums of money.", "We signed one bill.", "or we passed one bill, just a couple of weeks ago in the House of Representatives for $500 million - a half a billion dollars.", "That is just a downpayment, in my opinion.", "But, unlike Governor Reagan, I do not support a boondoggle like the MX missile.", "I've just gotten a report from the Air Force that indicates that the 30-year lifecycle cost of that system is going to be $100 billion.", "The initial cost is about $54 billion, and then when you add in the additional costs - not only the construction of the system, the missiles and the personnel, and so on - when you add in the additional costs over the lifecycle of that system, over $100 billion.", "I would propose to save the taxpayers of this country from that kind of costly boondoggle.", "But that's not the $54 billion cost that John is talking about.", "He's talking about that fantastic plan of the Administration to take thousands and thousands of square miles out in the Western states.", "And first, he was going to dig a racetrack and have it going around in the racetrack so it would meet the requirements of SALT II treaty, and now he's decided it'll have a straight up and down thing, so it can he both verifiable and yet hideable from the Soviet Union.", "But I am not in favor of the plan that is so costly.", " I don't think I'd have to go against that pledge.", "I think one of the problems today with the cities is Federal aid.", "The mayors that I've talked to in some of our leading cities tell!", "me that the Federal grants that come with.", "for a specific cause or a specific objective, come with such red tape, such priorities established by a bureaucracy in Washington, that the local government's hands are tied with regard to using that money as they feel could best be used, and for what they think might be the top priority.", "If they had that money without those government restrictions, every one of them has told me they could make great savings and make far greater use of the money.", "What I have been advocating is, why don't we start with the Federal Government turning back tax sources to states and local governments, as well as the responsibilities for those programs?", "Seventy-five percent of the people live in the cities.", "I don't know of a city in America that doesn't have the kind of problems you're talking about.", "But, where are we getting the money that the Federal Government is putting out to help them?", "New York is being taxed for money that will then go to Detroit.", "But Detroit is being taxed for money that, let's say, will go to Chicago, while Chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in Philadelphia.", "Wouldn't it make a lot more sense if the government let them keep their own money there in the first place?", "But there are other things that we can do with the inner cities, and I've believed.", "I have talked of having zones in those cities that are run down, where there is a high percentage of people on welfare, and offer tax incentives.", "The government isn't getting a tax now from businesses there because they aren't there, or from individuals who are on welfare rather than working.", "And why don't we offer incentives for business and industry to start up in those zones?", "Give them a tax moratorium for a period if they build and develop there.", "The individuals that would then get jobs - give them a break that encourages them to leave the social welfare programs and go to work.", "We could have an urban homestead act.", "We've got thousands and thousands of homes owned by government boarded up, being vandalized, that have been taken in mortgage foreclosures.", "What if we had a homestead act, and said to the people, for $1 we sell you this house.", "All have to do is agree to refurbish it, make it habitable, and live in it - just as 100 or more years ago, we did with the open land in this country - urban .", "or country homesteading.", " Mr. May, I recently saw a Princeton University study that indicated that the cities of America - the large cities of this country - are in worse shape today than they were in 1960.", "It seems to totally belie the claim that I heard President Carter make a few days ago, that he was the first President that had come forth with a real urban strategy to meet the problems of urban America.", "Incidentally, just this past week, the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen, I guess, because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits.", "I'm happy to say that, in contrast to that, the Anderson-Lucey platform for America, program for the 80s, has devoted considerable time, and in very specific detail, we have talked about two things that ought to be done to aid urban America.", "We call, first of all, for the creation of a $4 billion urban reinvestment trust fund to do exactly what you spoke about in your question - to rebuild the streets, to rebuild the cities, the leaking water mains.", "I was in North Pittsburgh - I think it was a few weeks ago, on my campaign - the water mains in that city had begun to leak, and literally, there wasn't money available to fix them.", "We have also provided in our program for a $4 billion Community Trust Fund, and we've told you where the money is coming from.", "It's going to come from the dedication, by 1984, of the excise revenues that today are being collected by the Federal Government on alcohol and tobacco.", "That money, I think, ought to be put into rebuilding the base of our cities.", "John claims that he is making plain where the money will come from.", "It will come from the pockets of the people.", "It will come from the pockets of the people who are living in those very areas.", "And the problem is, with Governments - Federal, State and Local - taking $.44 out of every dollar earned, that the Federal Government has pre-empted too many of the tax sources, and that the cities.", "Now, the Federal Government is going to turn around and say, well you have this problem; we will now hand you the money to do it.", "But the Federal Government doesn't make money.", "It just takes - from the people.", "And in my view, this is not the answer to the problem.", "Stand in the South Bronx as I did, in the spot where Jimmy Carter made his promise that he was going to, with multi-billion dollar programs, refurbish that area that looks like bombed-out London in World War II.", "I stood there, and I met the people.", "And I heard them ask just for something that would give them hope.", "And I believe that, while all of the promises have been broken, they've never been carried out.", "It seems to me that to deny the responsibility of the Federal Government to do something about our crumbling cities is to deny the opportunity for one thing: To 55% of the black population of our country that is locked within the inner cities of the metropolitan areas of our country.", "We simply cannot ignore the fact that, in those cities today, we have 55% youth unemployment among black and Hispanic youth.", "It's because they have lost their industry.", "It's because they no longer present the kind of viable economic climate that makes it possible for industry to remain there, or to locate there.", "I think Government has a responsibility to find jobs for the youth of this country, and that the place to start is to assist in the very important and necessary task of helping cities rebuild.", "When these Presidential Debates were held just four years ago, I remember the incumbent President, who was willing to debate, President Ford, telling the American people that they simply ought not to vote for somebody who promised more than they could deliver.", "Well, we've seen what has happened.", "Instead we had, I think, in the second quarter, a Consumer Price Index registering around 12%.", "And nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the Wholesale Price Index - that's about 18% on an annualized basis - what it's going to be.", "I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan.", "His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information.", "He went so far as to call it \"brutal economics.\"", "I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done.", "But, you know, it's gotten to be about $122 difference.", "Somebody worked it out.", "And they figured out that between the tax cut that Governor Reagan is promising the American people, and the tax cut that Jimmy Carter is promising in 198I, his is worth about $122 more.", "So you, dear voters, are out there on the auction block, and these two candidates are bidding for your votes.", "And one is going to give you $122 more if you happen to be in that range of about a $20,000-a-year income.", "I'm going to wait until I see that that inflation rate is going down, before I even begin to phase in the business tax cuts that I've talked about.", "But I think, by improving productivity, they would be far less inflationary than the consumption-oriented tax cut that Governor Reagan is recommending.", "I've done it.", "We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures.", "And eliminated probably more quickly than our plan, but we wanted to be so conservative with it, that people would see how.", "how well it could be done.", "And that state we controlled spending.", "We cut the rate of increase in spending in half.", "But at the same time, we gave back to the people of California - in tax rebates, tax credits, tax cuts - $5.7 billion.", "I vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned.", "And among those vetoes, I stopped $16 billion in additional spending.", "And the funny thing was that California, which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment, for those six years for the first time, was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment.", "We have considered inflation in our figures.", "We deliberately took figures that we, ourselves, believed were too conservative.", "But he's going to get a half-a-trillion dollars more over the next five years that he can use for additional programs, or hopefully, someplace down the line, balancing the budget.", "We believe that that's too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people.", "But I do know that, despite his pledge to reduce state Government spending, that it rose from $4.6 billion when he took office in 1967, to $10.2 billion during his eight years in office.", "Spending, in other words.", "more than doubled, and it rose at a faster rate than spending was rising in the Federal Government.", "But on his very optimistic figures about his tax cut producing a balanced budget by 1983, and the fact that he is using, he says, the figures of the Senate Budget Committee, that Senate Budget Committee Report does not accommodate all of the Reagan defense plans.", "In other words, I have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million a year, just for the military.", "And I think the figures that he has given are simply not going to stand up.", " Well, some people look up figures, and some people make up figures.", "And John has just made up some very interesting figures.", "We took the Senate report, of course.", "But we did factor in our own ideas with regard to increases in the projected military spending that we believe would, over a period of time, do what is necessary.", "The truth of the matter is, we did cut the increase in spending in half.", "It at the John doesn't quite realize - he's never held an executive position of that kind.", "And one journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, a respected newspaper, said there was no question about the fact that Governor Reagan had prevented the State of California from going bankrupt.", "Going around this country, I think that I have found a great hunger in America for a spiritual revival.", "For a belief that law must be based on a higher law.", "For a return to traditions and values that we once had.", "Our Government, in its most sacred documents - the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and all - speak of man being created, of a Creator.", "That we're a nation under God.", "Now, I have thought for a long time that too many of our churches have been too reluctant to speak up in behalf of what they believe is proper in Government, and they have been too too lax in interfering, in recent years, with Government's invasion of the family itself, putting itself between parent and child.", "I vetoed a number of bills of that kind myself, when I was in California.", "But I do believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to express themselves, or to even try to persuade others to follow their leader.", "That's what elections are all about.", " Ms. Golden, certainly the church has the right to take a position on moral issues.", "But to try, as occurred in the case that you mentioned - that specific case - to try to tell the parishioners of any church, of any denomination, how they should vote, or for whom they should vote, I think violates the principle of separation of church and state.", "Now, Governor Reagan is running on a platform that calls for a Constitutional amendment banning abortion.", "I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual.", "And for the state to interfere with a Constitutional amendment, and tell a woman that she must carry that pregnancy to term, regardless of her personal belief, that, I think, violates freedom of conscience as much as anything that I can think of.", "And he is also running on a platform that suggests a litmus test for the selection of judges - that only judges that hold a certain, quote, \"view,\" on the sanctity of family life, ought to be appointed to the Federal Judiciary, one of the three great independent branches of our Government.", "I believe in freedom of choice.", "I don't believe in Constitutional Amendments that would interfere with that.", "I don't believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the Federal Judiciary.", "On the Amendment that you mentioned, I abandoned it 15 years ago.", "And I have said freely, all over this country, that it was a mistake for me or anyone to ever try to put the Judeo-Christian heritage of this country, important as it is, and important as my religious faith is to me - it's a very deeply personal matter.", "But for me to try, in this very pluralistic society of ours, to try to frame any definition, whatever, of what that belief should be, is wrong.", "And so, not once, but twice - in 1971 - I voted on the floor of the House of Representatives against a Constitutional amendment that tried to bring prayer back into the public schools.", "I think mother ought to whisper to Johnny and to Susie, as they button their coats in the morning and leave for the classroom, \"Be sure to say a prayer before you start your day's work.\"", "But I don't think that the state, the Board of Regents, a Board of Education, or any state official, should try to compose that prayer for a child to recite.", " The litmus test that John says is in the Republican platform, says no more than the judges to be appointed should have a respect for innocent life.", "Now, I don't think that's a bad idea.", "I think all of us should have a respect for innocent life.", "With regard to the freedom of the individual for choice with regard to abortion, there's one individual who's not being considered at all.", "That's the one who is being aborted.", "And I've noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born.", "I happen to believe it is.", " I also think that that unborn child has a right to be wanted.", "And I also believe, sir, that the most personal intimate decision that any woman is ever called upon to make is the decision as to whether or not she shall carry a pregnancy to term.", " Before beginning my closing remarks, here, I would just like to remark a concern that I have that we have criticized the failures of the Carter policy here rather considerably, both of us this evening.", "But I believe it would have been much more unfair to have had John Anderson denied the right to participate in this debate.", "And I want to express my appreciation to the League of Women Voters for adopting a course with which I believe the great majority of Americans are in agreement.", "Well, we, the living Americans, have gone through four wars.", "We've gone through a Great Depression in our lifetime that literally was worldwide and almost brought us to our knees.", "But we came through all of those things and we achieved even new heights and new greatness.", "The living Americans today have fought harder, paid a higher price for freedom, and done more to advance the dignity of man than any people who ever lived on this earth.", "I still believe that.", "I'm not running for the Presidency because I believe that I can solve the problems we've discussed tonight.", "I believe the people of this country can, and together, we can begin the world over again.", "We can meet our destiny - and that destiny to build a land here that will be, for all mankind, a shining city on a hill.", " Mr. Movers, President Carter was not right a few weeks ago when he said that the American people were confronted with only two choices, with only two men, and with only two parties.", "We have disagreed, I believe, on virtually every other issue.", "I believe that all of us are going to have to begin to work together to solve our problems.", "I don't think you do think that.", "And therefore, I think you ought to consider doing something about it, and voting for an Independent in 1980.", "You know, a generation of office seekers has tried to tell the American people that they could get something for nothing.", "It's been a time, therefore, of illusion and false hopes, and the longer it continues, the more dangerous it becomes.", "We've got to stop drifting.", "What I wish tonight so desperately is that we had had more time to talk about some of the other issues that are so fundamentally important.", "A great historian, Henry Steele Commager, said that in their lust for victory, neither traditional party is looking beyond November.", "And he went on to cite three issues that their platforms totally ignore: atomic warfare, Presidential Directive 59 notwithstanding.", "If we don't resolve that issue, all others become irrelevant.", "The issue of our natural resources; the right of posterity to inherit the earth, and what kind of earth will it be?", "The issue of nationalism - the recognition, he says, that every major problem confronting us is global, and cannot be solved by nationalism here or elsewhere - that is chauvinistic, that is parochial, that is as anachronistic as states' rights was in the days of Jefferson Davis.", "Those are some of the great issues - atomic warfare, the use of our natural resources, and the issue of nationalism - that I intend to be talking about in the remaining six weeks of this campaign, and I dare hope that the American people will be listening and that they will see that an Independent government of John Anderson and Patrick Lucey can give us the kind of coalition government that we need in 1980 to begin to solve our problems.", "It's also a pleasure to be with my 2 opponents this evening.", "Admiral Stockdale, may I say it's a special honor to share this stage with you.", "Those of us

US companies to move overseas and throw Americans out of work.", "In Decaturville, Tennessee, not very far from my home, a factory was shut down right there when they were solicited by officials paid

day his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, came out and said that's not a pledge.", "Then 2 weeks ago he said that after the election, if you win, then James Baker's going to go back to be secretary of

didn't think these things through properly.", "And these are the things you have to think through.", "What I want to do is change the dynamics on the ground.", "And you have to do that by beginning to not back off of the Fallujahs and other places, and send the wrong message to the terrorists.", "You have to close the borders.", "You've got to show you're serious in that regard.", "But you've also got to show that you are prepared to bring the rest of the world in and share the stakes.", "I will make a flat statement: The United States of America has no long-term designs on staying in Iraq.", "And our goal in my administration would be to get all of the troops out of there with a minimal amount you need for training and logistics as we do in some other countries in the world after a war to be able to sustain the peace.", "But that's how we're going to win the peace, by rapidly training the Iraqis themselves.", " There are 100,000 troops trained, police, guard, special units, border patrol.", "There's going to be 125,000 trained by the end of this year.", "Yes, we're getting the job done.", "It's hard work.", "Now, my opponent says he's going to try to change the dynamics on the ground.", "Well, Prime Minister Allawi was here.", "He is the leader of that country.", "He's a brave, brave man.", "When he came, after giving a speech to the Congress, my opponent questioned his credibility.", "You can't change the dynamics on the ground if you've criticized the brave leader of Iraq.", "One of his campaign people alleged that Prime Minister Allawi was like a puppet.", "That's no way to treat somebody who's courageous and brave, that is trying to lead his country forward.", "The way to make sure that we succeed is to send consistent, sound messages to the Iraqi people that when we give our word, we will keep our word, that we stand with you, that we believe you want to be free.", "I believe that 25 million people, the vast majority, long to have elections.", "I reject this notion -- and I'm suggesting my opponent isn't -- I reject the notion that some say that if you're Muslim you can't free, you don't desire freedom.", "I disagree, strongly disagree with that.", " I couldn't agree more that the Iraqis want to be free and that they could be free.", "But I think the president, again, still hasn't shown how he's going to go about it the right way.", "Now, Prime Minister Allawi came here, and he said the terrorists are pouring over the border.", "That's Allawi's assessment.", "The national intelligence assessment that was given to the president in July said, best-case scenario, more of the same of what we see today; worst-case scenario, civil war.", "I can do better.", "They understand that a free Afghanistan or a free Iraq will be a major defeat for them.", "And those are the stakes.", "And that's why it is essential we not leave.", "That's why it's essential we hold the line.", "That's why it's essential we win.", "Under my leadership we're going to win this war in Iraq.", " I would hope I never have to.", "I understand how hard it is to commit troops.", "Never wanted to commit troops.", "I think that by speaking clearly and doing what we say and not sending mixed messages, it is less likely we'll ever have to use troops.", "I was hopeful diplomacy would work in Iraq.", "There was no doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein was hoping that the world would turn a blind eye.", "And if he had been in power, in other words, if we would have said, \"Let the inspectors work, or let's, you know, hope to talk him out.", "There's just no doubt in my mind we would rue the day, had Saddam Hussein been in power.", "So we use diplomacy every chance we get, believe me.", "And I would hope to never have to use force.", "But by speaking clearly and sending messages that we mean what we say, we've affected the world in a positive way.", "Libya was a threat.", "Libya is now peacefully dismantling its weapons programs.", "Libya understood that America and others will enforce doctrine and that the world is better for it.", "I think by acting firmly and decisively, it will mean it is less likely we have to use force.", "Saddam Hussein didn't attack us.", "Osama bin Laden attacked us.", "Al Qaida attacked us.", "With the American military forces nearby and in the field, we didn't use the best trained troops in the world to go kill the world's number one criminal and terrorist.", "They outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, who only a week earlier had been on the other side fighting against us, neither of whom trusted each other.", "That's the enemy that attacked us.", "That's the enemy that was allowed to walk out of those mountains.", "That's the enemy that is now in 60 countries, with stronger recruits.", "He also said Saddam Hussein would have been stronger.", "That is just factually incorrect.", "Two-thirds of the country was a no-fly zone when we started this war.", "We would have had sanctions.", "We would have had the U.N. inspectors.", "Saddam Hussein would have been continually weakening.", "If the president had shown the patience to go through another round of resolution, to sit down with those leaders, say, \"What do you need, what do you need now, how much more will it take to get you to join us?\"", "we'd be in a stronger place today.", "And secondly, to think that another round of resolutions would have caused Saddam Hussein to disarm, disclose, is ludicrous, in my judgment.", "It just shows a significant difference of opinion.", "We tried diplomacy.", "We did our best.", "He was hoping to turn a blind eye.", "And, yes, he would have been stronger had we not dealt with him.", "He had the capability of making weapons, and he would have made weapons.", " Thirty-five to forty countries in the world had a greater capability of making weapons at the moment the president invaded than Saddam Hussein.", "And while he's been diverted, with 9 out of 10 active duty divisions of our Army, either going to Iraq, coming back from Iraq, or getting ready to go, North Korea's gotten nuclear weapons and the world is more dangerous.", "Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons and the world is more dangerous.", "Darfur has a genocide.", "The world is more dangerous.", "I'd have made a better choice.", "My attitude is you take preemptive action in order to protect the American people, that you act in order to make this country secure.", "My opponent talks about me not signing certain treaties.", "Let me tell you one thing I didn't sign, and I think it shows the difference of our opinion -- the difference of opinions.", "And that is, I wouldn't join the International Criminal Court.", "This is a body based in The Hague where unaccountable judges and prosecutors can pull our troops or diplomats up for trial.", "And I understand that in certain capitals around the world that that wasn't a popular move.", "But it's the right move not to join a foreign court that could -- where our people could be prosecuted.", "My opponent is for joining the International Criminal Court.", "I just think trying to be popular, kind of, in the global sense, if it's not in our best interest makes no sense.", "I'm interested in working with our nations and do a lot of it.", "But I'm not going to make decisions that I think are wrong for America.", " North Korea, first, I do.", "Before I was sworn in, the policy of this government was to have bilateral negotiations with North Korea.", "And we signed an agreement with North Korea that my administration found out that was not being honored by the North Koreans.", "And so I decided that a better way to approach the issue was to get other nations involved, just besides us.", "And in Crawford, Texas, Jiang Zemin and I agreed that the nuclear-weapons-free peninsula, Korean Peninsula, was in his interest and our interest and the world's interest.", "And so we began a new dialogue with North Korea, one that included not only the United States, but now China.", "And China's a got a lot of influence over North Korea, some ways more than we do.", "As well, we included South Korea, Japan and Russia.", "So now there are five voices speaking to Kim Jong Il, not just one.", "And so if Kim Jong Il decides again to not honor an agreement, he's not only doing injustice to America, he'd be doing injustice to China, as well.", "And I think this will work.", "It's not going to work if we open up a dialogue with Kim Jong Il.", "That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what he wants.", "He wants to unravel the six- party talks, or the five-nation coalition that's sending him a clear message.", "On Iran, I hope we can do the same thing, continue to work with the world to convince the Iranian mullahs to abandon their nuclear ambitions.", "The IAEA is involved.", "There's a special protocol recently been passed that allows for inspections.", "And we've got a good strategy.", "I believe we could have done better.", "I think the United States should have offered the opportunity to provide the nuclear fuel, test them, see whether or not they were actually looking for it for peaceful purposes.", "If they weren't willing to work a deal, then we could have put sanctions together.", "The president did nothing.", "With respect to North Korea, the real story: We had inspectors and television cameras in the nuclear reactor in North Korea.", "Secretary Bill Perry negotiated that under President Clinton.", "And we knew where the fuel rods were.", "And we knew the limits on their nuclear power.", "The president reversed it publicly while the president of South Korea was here.", "And for two years, this administration didn't talk at all to North Korea.", "While they didn't talk at all, the fuel rods came out, the inspectors were kicked out, the television cameras were kicked out.", "And today, there are four to seven nuclear weapons in the hands of North Korea.", "That happened on this president's watch.", "Now, that, I think, is one of the most serious, sort of, reversals or mixed messages that you could possibly send.", " The minute we have bilateral talks, the six-party talks will unwind.", "That's exactly what Kim Jong Il wants.", "And by the way, the breach on the agreement was not through plutonium.", "The breach on the agreement is highly enriched uranium.", "That's what we caught him doing.", "That's where he was breaking the agreement.", "Secondly, he said -- my opponent said where he worked to put sanctions on Iran -- we've already sanctioned Iran.", "We can't sanction them any more.", "There are sanctions in place on Iran.", "And finally, we were a party to the convention -- to working with Germany, France and Great Britain to send their foreign ministers into Iran.", "In order for the sanctions to be effective, we should have been working with the British, French and Germans and other countries.", "And that's the difference between the president and me.", "Now, with respect to Darfur, yes, it is a genocide.", "I think the reason that we're not saying send American troops in at this point is severalfold.", "Number one, we can do this through the African Union, providing we give them the logistical support.", "Right now all the president is providing is humanitarian support.", "We need to do more than that.", "They've got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing.", "I also believe that it is -- one of the reasons we can't do it is we're overextended.", "We've got Guards and Reserves who are doing double duties.", "So this is the way the president has overextended the United States.", "That's why, in my plan, I add two active duty divisions to the United States Army, not for Iraq, but for our general demands across the globe.", "I also intend to double the number of special forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect fighting the terrorists around the world.", "It's a moral responsibility for us and the world.", "It was not my administration that put the sanctions on Iran.", "That happened long before I arrived in Washington, D.C.", "In terms of Darfur, I agree it's genocide.", "And Colin Powell so stated.", "I agree with my opponent that we shouldn't be committing troops.", "We ought to be working with the African Union to do so -- precisely what we did in Liberia.", "We helped stabilize the situation with some troops, and when the African Union came, we moved them out.", "You cannot lead if you send mixed messages.", "Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our troops.", "Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our allies.", "Mixed messages send the wrong signals to the Iraqi citizens.", "And that's my biggest concern about my opponent.", "Of course, we change tactics when need to, but we never change our beliefs, the strategic beliefs that are necessary to protect this country in the world.", "What I worry about with the president is that he's not acknowledging what's on the ground, he's not acknowledging the realities of North Korea, he's not acknowledging the truth of the science of stem-cell research or of global warming and other issues.", " Well, I think -- listen, I fully agree that one should shift tactics, and we will, in Iraq.", "Our commanders have got all the flexibility to do what is necessary to succeed.", "But what I won't do is change my core values because of politics or because of pressure.", " I have no intention of wilting.", "I've never wilted in my life.", "And I've never wavered in my life.", "I know exactly what we need to do in Iraq, and my position has been consistent: Saddam Hussein is a threat.", "He needed to be disarmed.", "We needed to go to the U.N.", "But we didn't need to rush to war without a plan to win the peace.", "There's some 600-plus tons of unsecured material still in the former Soviet Union and Russia.", "At the rate that the president is currently securing it, it'll take 13 years to get it.", "I did a lot of work on this.", "I wrote a book about it several years ago -- six, seven years ago -- called \"The New War,\" which saw the difficulties of this international criminal network.", "And this president, I regret to say, has secured less nuclear material in the last two years since 9/11 than we did in the two years preceding 9/11.", "The president actually cut the money for it.", "You have to put the money into it and the funding and the leadership.", "And part of that leadership is sending the right message to places like North Korea.", "Right now the president is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunker-busting nuclear weapons.", "The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons.", "We're telling other people, \"You can't have nuclear weapons,\" but we're pursuing a new nuclear weapon that we might even contemplate using.", "I'm going to shut that program down, and we're going to make it clear to the world we're serious about containing nuclear proliferation.", "And we're going to get the job of containing all of that nuclear material in Russia done in four years.", "And we're going to build the strongest international network to prevent nuclear proliferation.", "This is the scale of what President Kennedy set out to do with the nuclear test ban treaty.", "It's our generation's equivalent.", "And I intend to get it done.", " Actually, we've increased funding for dealing with nuclear proliferation about 35 percent since I've been the president.", "Secondly, we've set up what's called the -- well, first of all, I agree with my opponent that the biggest threat facing this country is weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a terrorist network.", "And that's why proliferation is one of the centerpieces of a multi-prong strategy to make the country safer.", "My administration started what's called the Proliferation Security Initiative.", "Over 60 nations involved with disrupting the trans-shipment of information and/or weapons of mass destruction materials.", "We busted the A.Q.", "Khan network.", "This was a proliferator out of Pakistan that was selling secrets to places like North Korea and Libya.", "We convinced Libya to disarm.", "It's a central part of dealing with weapons of mass destruction and proliferation.", "I'll tell you another way to help protect America in the long run is to continue with missile defenses.", "And we've got a robust research and development program that has been ongoing during my administration.", "We'll be implementing a missile-defense system relatively quickly.", "And that is another way to help deal with the threats that we face in the 21st century.", "My opponent opposed the missile defenses.", "I'm going to do it in four years, and I'm going to immediately set out to have bilateral talks with North Korea.", " Again, I can't tell you how big a mistake I think that is, to have bilateral talks with North Korea.", "It's precisely what Kim Jong Il wants.", "It will cause the six-party talks to evaporate.", "It will mean that China no longer is involved in convincing, along with us, for Kim Jong Il to get rid of his weapons.", "It's a big mistake to do that.", "We must have China's leverage on Kim Jong Il, besides ourselves.", "And if you enter bilateral talks, they'll be happy to walk away from the table.", "I don't think that'll work.", "I mean, he's also a strong ally in the war on terror.", "He is -- listen, they went through a horrible situation in Beslan, where these terrorists gunned down young school kids.", "That's why we need to be firm and resolved in bringing them to justice.", "Russia is a country in transition.", "Vladimir is going to have to make some hard choices.", "And I think it's very important for the American president, as well as other Western leaders, to remind him of the great benefits of democracy, that democracy will best help the people realize their hopes and aspirations and dreams.", "And I was probably one of the first senators, along with Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, a former senator, to go down into the KGB underneath Treblinka Square and see reams of files with names in them.", "And I think it goes beyond just the response to terror.", "Mr. Putin now controls all the television stations.", "His political opposition is being put in jail.", "And I think it's very important to the United States, obviously, to have a working relationship that is good.", "This is a very important country to us.", "We want a partnership.", "But we always have to stand up for democracy.", "As George Will said the other day, \"Freedom on the march; not in Russia right now.\"", "We could have bilateral talks with Kim Jong Il.", "And we can get those weapons at the same time as we get China.", "Because China has an interest in the outcome, too.", "And, unfortunately, he didn't go to war as a last resort.", "Now we have this incredible mess in Iraq -- $200 billion.", "It's not what the American people thought they were getting when they voted.", "But we have a different set of convictions about how we make our country stronger here at home and respected again in the world.", "But I have a difference with this president.", "I believe when we're strongest when we reach out and lead the world and build strong alliances.", "I have a plan for Iraq.", "I believe we can be successful.", "And we need a fresh start, a new credibility, a president who can bring allies to our side.", "I also have a plan to win the war on terror, funding homeland security, strengthening our military, cutting our finances, reaching out to the world, again building strong alliances.", "I believe America's best days are ahead of us because I believe that the future belongs to freedom, not to fear.", "If America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy.", "That's not going to happen, so long as I'm your president.", "The next four years we will continue to strengthen our homeland defenses.", "We will strengthen our intelligence-gathering services.", "We will reform our military.", "The military will be an all-volunteer army.", "We will continue to stay on the offense.", "We will fight the terrorists around the world so we do not have to face them here at home.", "We'll continue to build our alliances.", "I'll never turn over America's national security needs to leaders of other countries, as we continue to build those alliances.", "And we'll continue to spread freedom.", "I believe in the transformational power of liberty.", "I believe that the free Iraq is in this nation's interests.", "I believe a free Afghanistan is in this nation's interest.", "And I believe both a free Afghanistan and a free Iraq will serve as a powerful example for millions who plead in silence for liberty in the broader Middle East.", "Four years ago I ran for president at a time of high unemployment and rising frustration.", "I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community where everybody has a role to play.", "I wanted a government that was smaller and less bureaucratic to help people make the most of their own lives.", "Four years ago you took me on faith.", "Now there's a record: Ten and a half million more jobs, rising incomes, falling crime rates and welfare rolls,

environment.", "We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans.", "Now let's pass the tax cuts for education and child rearing, help with medical emergencies, and buying a home.", "We passed family and medical leave.", "Now let's expand it so more people can succeed as parents and in the work force.", "We passed 100,000 police, the assault weapons ban, the Brady Bill.", "Now let's keep going by finishing the work of putting the police on the street and tackling juvenile gangs.", "We passed welfare reform.", "Now let's move a million people from welfare to work.", "And most important, let's make education our highest priority so that every eight-year-old will be able to read, every 12-year-old can log onto the Internet, every 18-year-old can go to college.", "We can build that bridge to the 21st Century.", "And that's what America is all about.", "I remember getting my future back from doctors and nurses and a doctor in Chicago named Dr. Kalikian .", "And ever since that time, I've tried to give something back to my country, to the people who are watching us tonight.", "America is the greatest place on the face of the earth.", "Now, I know millions of you still have anxieties.",

worry about the future and will they have the same opportunities that you and I have had.", "Now, I'm a plain-speaking man and I learned long ago that your word was your bond.", "And I promise you tonight that I'll try to address your concerns and not try to exploit them.", " Well, Jim, I believe that the Federal government should give people the tools and try to establish the conditions in which they can make the most of their own lives.", "For example, we have reduced the size of the Federal government to its smallest size in 30 years.", "We reduced more regulations, eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors.", "But I have worked hard for things like the Family and Medical Leave Law, the Brady Bill, the assault weapons ban, the program to put 100,000 police on the street.", "I've worked hard to help families impart values to their own children.", "I supported the V-chip so that parents would be able to control what their kids watch on television when

people.", "That's my difference with the President.", " I trust the people.", "We've done a lot to give the people more powers to make their own decisions over their own lives.", "But I do think we are right when we try to, for example, give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital, ending these drive-by deliveries.", "Our government is smaller and less bureaucratic and has given more authority to the states than its two predecessors under Republican presidents.", "But I do believe we have to help our people get ready to succeed in the 21st

decade.", "We have record numbers of new small businesses.", "We have the biggest drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 years.", "All groups of people are growing.", "We had the biggest drop in income inequality in 27 years in 1995.", "The average family's income has gone up over $1600 just since our economic plan passed.", "So I think it's clear that we're better off than we were four years ago.", "Now we need to focus on what do we need to do to be better off still.", "How can we help people as we are to get their retirements when they work for small businesses, to be able to afford health insurance, to be able to educate their children.", "That's what I want to focus on.", " I doubt that I acknowledged that this year.", "But in any event, I think we just look at the facts.", "It's not whether we're better off, it's whether they're better off.", "Drug use has doubled the past 44 months all across America.", "But of the people listening tonight, the working

wouldn't work at the time.", "Then his budget that he passed along with Speaker Gingrich cut Medicare $270 billion, more than was necessary to repair the Medicare trust fund.", "The American Medical,

vetoed.", "And now with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Senator Dole's, even his own friends, his campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says that they can't possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well, according to him.", "Now, my balanced budget plan adds ten years to the life of the Medicare trust fund, ten years.", "And we'll have time to deal with the long-term problems of the baby boomers.", "But it was simply wrong to finance their last scheme to cut Medicare $270 billion to run the risk of it withering on the vine.", " Well, I must say, I look back at the vote on Medicare in 1965, we had a program called Eldercare that also provided drugs and means tests to people who needed medical attention received it.", "I thought it was a good program.", "But I've supported Medicare ever since.", "In fact, I used to go home, my mother would tell me, Bob, all I've got is my Social Security and my Medicare, don't cut it.", "I wouldn't violate

already spent $45 million scaring seniors and tearing me apart.", "I think it's time to have a truce.", "My balanced budget plan puts ten years on the Medicare.", "We ought to do that, then we can have a commission.", "But Senator Dole's plans are not good for the country.", "This is not a Wall Street tax cut.", "This is a family tax cut.", "This is a Main Street tax cut, 15 percent across --

lawyer saying I think we've got a case here.", "And it's also regulatory reform.", "It's a good package, Mr. President.", " Well, here's the problem with it: It sounds very good, but there's a reason that 500 economists, including seven Nobel prize winners and business periodicals like Business Week, and even Senator Dole's friends, Senator Warren Rudman, former Republican senator from New Hampshire, says it's not a practical program.", "It's a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans, and small business loans.", "It's not good to raise the deficit.", "We worked too hard to lower it.", "It will actually raise taxes on nine million people and, in addition to that, it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed

that others have in sending their children to better schools.", "It will work, and when it does work, Mr. President, I know you'll congratulate me.", " Well, I try to articulate my positions as clearly as possible, tell people what I stand for and let them decide whether they're going to support me or not.", "The Senator mentioned the trial lawyers.", "And I told the people exactly what the Congress exactly what kind of bill I would sign.", "Now, let me just give you an example.", "I had a person in the Oval Office who lost a child in a school bus accident where a drunk driver caused the accident directly, but there were problems with the school bus.", "The drunk driver had no money.", "Under the new bill, if I had signed it, a person like that could never have had any recovery.", "I thought that was wrong.", "So I gave four or five specific examples to the Congress and said, prove to me that these people could recover but we're going to eliminate frivolous lawsuits, I'll sign the bill.", "But generally I believe that a president has to be willing to do what he thinks is right.", "I've done a lot of things that were controversial.", "My economic plan, my trade position, Bosnia, Haiti, taking on the NRA for the first time, taking on the tobacco companies for the first time.", "That's what I've tried to do and that's what I will continue to do as president.", "I look at the trial lawyers, and when you're a few million short, you run out to Hollywood and pick up two to four million and organized labor comes to Washington, D.C. and puts 35 million into the pot.", "Now, if these aren't special interests, I've got a lot to learn.", "But it seemed to me there's got to be some end to the frivolous lawsuits and there's got to be some cap on punitive damage.", "You're putting a lot of business people out of business.", "Small businessmen and businesswomen who paid 70 percent of your ninteen , your$265 billion tax increase, the largest tax increase in the history of America.", "So I modified it, the largest tax increase in the history of the world.", " Let me say, first of all, I signed a tort reform bill that dealt with civilian aviation a couple of years ago.", "I proved that I will sign reasonable tort reform.", "Secondly, Senator Dole had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money, but it wasn't me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who were subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up for the Federal government when we tried to stop the advertising, marketing, and sales of tobacco to children.", "And it wasn't me that let the polluters actually come into the halls of Congress, into the rooms, and rewrite the environmental laws.", "That's what Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole did, not me.", " That's not true.", " So I believe that we should take a different approach to this and talk about how we stand on the issues instead of trying to characterize each other's motivations.", "I think Senator Dole and I just honestly disagree.", " I think it's very difficult.", "That's why we need campaign finance reform.", "We've done about all, we are the reform party, the Republican Party.", "And the Perot voters that are looking for a home ought to take a look at the Republican record.", "Whatever it is, whatever the checklist was in '92, it's all done with campaign finance reform.", "I worked with Senator Mitchell, who played me, I guess, in the debate warmup.", "We tried six or eight years ago.", "He appointed three people, I appointed three people to get campaign finance reform.", "You've suggested a commission, Newt Gingrich did, I suggested that at least four or five years ago.", "We have a commission on campaign finance reform.", "They send it to Congress, and we have to vote it up or down.", "That's how it works.", "But I want to go back to 1965.", "That was my first vote against tobacco companies when I said we ought to label cigarettes.", "And I've had a consistent record ever since 1965.", "We passed a bill in 1992 that encouraged the states to adopt programs to stop kids from smoking.", "All 50 states did it.", "It took three and a half years.", "It wasn't until election year, Mr. President, that you ever thought about stopping smoking.", "Cocaine is up 141 percent -- marijuana, cocaine up 166 percent.", "I agree that too many incumbent politicians in Washington in both parties have consistently opposed campaign finance reform.", "That was certainly the case from the minute I got there.", "So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested -- a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission.", "And I shook hands with him on it and I appointed my members, and the commission never met.", "And then Senator Dole's ardent supporters, Senator McCain, who's out there today, along with Senator Feingold, supported, sponsored a campaign finance reform proposal.", "I strongly supported it.", "And members of Senator Dole's own party in the Senate killed it.", "And he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill.", "So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have.", " Well, on campaign reform itself, we're going to get it when we have a bipartisan commission, take it out of politics.", "Get people who don't have any interest in politics but understand the issue and let them make the recommendation to Congress.", "These are sophisticated people watching tonight.", "Millions and millions of Americans.", "They know the Republican Party hasn't done it.", "They know the Democratic party won't do it.", "We ought to agree that somebody else should do it.", "And we have to vote it up or down, Mr. President.", " Well, Jim, I think every American in any position of responsibility should be concerned about what's happened.", "I am.", "But let's look at the overall record.", "Overall in America cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years, casual drug use down 13 percent.", "The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it.", "Let me tell you what I tried to do about it.", "I appointed a four-star general who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country as our nation's drug czar.", "The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired.", "We submitted the biggest drug budget ever.", "We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border.", "We supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including, including the death penalty for drug kingpins.", "Even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them.", "I think we all do.", "I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn't dangerous and won't kill them and won't destroy their lives, get the message and change.", "You don't want to politicize drugs, but it's already politicized Medicare, go out and scare senior citizens and other vulnerable groups, veterans and people who get Pell Grants and things like this.", "But it seems to me the record is clear.", "The record is pretty clear in Arkansas, when you were governor.", "Drug use doubled.", "You resisted the appointment of a drug czar there because you thought it might interfere with treatment.", "But here you cut the drug czar's office 83 percent.", "You cut interdiction substantially.", "I mean that's what, I want to stop it from coming across the border.", "And in my administration, we're going to train the National Guard to stop it from coming across the border.", "This is a invasion of drugs from all over the world.", "You had a surgeon -- or before General McCaffrey (ph) you had a lady who said we ought to consider legalizing drugs.", "But it seems to me the kids ought to -- if they've started, they ought to stop and just don't do it.", "That's what I thought we ought to do.", "Secondly, Senator Dole, you voted against the crime bill that had the death penalty for drug kingpins in it.", "And you voted to cut services to 23 million school children under the safe and drug-free schools act.", "I don't think that means you're soft on drugs.", "We just have a different approach.", "We need to do this together and we can.", " Not if I didn't have a better idea.", "But I've got a better idea.", "It's something I've worked on for 15 years.", "It's called the automated check or the instant check.", "It's being used in 17 states right now.", "States like Florida, Colorado, Virginia, and other states.", "You don't buy any gun.", "You don't get any gun.", "We've got 20 million names on a computer in Washington, D.C. of people who should not have guns.", "We ought to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.", "And, there are eight other categories that should not have guns.", "I've been working on this for a long, long time.", "You walk in, you put your little card in there.", "If it says tilt, you don't get any gun.", "You don't get a hand gun, you don't get a rifle, you don't get a shot gun, you get zippo.", "The administration says they support the instant check.", "They've appropriated about $200 million, but only spent about $3 million to get it underway.", "In our administration, in my administration, we will expedite.", "This keeps up with technology.", "It keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have guns.", "There has only been one prosecution under the Brady -- only one under the assault weapon ban and only seven under the Brady Bill that you talk about all the time.", "And on the assault weapon ban, out of 17 weapons that were banned, only six banned now because eleven have been modified and are back on the street.", "The Brady Bill has kept at least 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers from getting hand guns.", "Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill.", "He tried to keep it from coming to my desk.", "He didn't succeed and I signed it and I'm glad I did.", "Then when we had the assault weapons ban in the Senate, Senator Dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the National Rifle Association didn't want the assault weapons ban, just like they didn't want the Brady Bill.", "But two years later nobody's lost their handguns.", "I mean, their rifles.", "We've expanded the Brady Bill to cover people who beat up their spouses and their kids.", "And this is a safer country.", "So I'm glad I took on that fight and I believe, with all respect, I was right and he was wrong.", " Well, the President doesn't have it quite right.", "I mean, it seemed to me at the time the assault weapon ban was not effective.", "But that's history.", "I told the NRA that's history.", "You're not going to worry about it anymore.", "I'm not going to worry about it anymore.", "You add all the states that've used the instant check and how many weapons they keep, kept out of the hands of criminals.", "It would far surpass the numbers you mentioned.", "Look at where we are today.", "The United States is still the indispensable nation in the aftermath of the Cold War and on the brink of the 21st Century.", "I have worked to support our country as the world's strongest force for peace and freedom, prosperity and security.", "We have done the following things: Number one, we've managed the aftermath of the Cold War, supporting a big drop in nuclear weapons in Russia.", "The removal of Russian troops from the Baltics.", "The integration of Central and Eastern European democracies into a new partnership with NATO.", "And, I might add, with the democratic Russia.", "There are no nuclear missiles pointed at the children of the United States tonight and have not been in our administration for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age.", "We have worked hard for peace and freedom.", "When I took office, Haiti was governed by a dictator that had defied the United States.", "When I took office, the worst war in Europe was waging in Bosnia.", "Now there is a the democratically elected president in Haiti.", "Peace in Bosnia.", "We just had the election there.", "We've made progress in Northern Ireland, in the Middle East.", "We've also stood up to the new threats of terrorism.", "The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, and we have worked hard to expand America's economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade with the largest new number of trade agreements in history And that's one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again.", "Now I understand it's been extended 'til some time next year.", "But, let's start with Somalia, where they dragged Americans through the streets, and where 18 Americans were killed one day, because they didn't have, they were pinned down for eight hours, the rangers.", "They didn't have the weapons, they didn't have the tanks.", "They asked for the tanks.", "We turn it over to the United Nations.", "The President didn't have much to do about it.", "You look at Haiti, where we spend about three billion dollars and we got an alarm call there about two weeks ago.", "You got to send down some more people, because the president's found out there are death squads on his on his, in his own property.", "So we need more protection from America.", "There's no ceasefire in Bosnia.", "I think there are still lot of problems in Bosnia.", "We agreed to train and arm the Muslims so they could defend themselves, the policy you had when you ran in 1992.", "We haven't done that.", "Americans shouldn't have gone there in the first place, had we let them defend themselves, as they have a right to do under Article 57 of the United Nations charter.", "Secondly, in Haiti, political violence is much, much smaller than it was.", "Thirdly, in Bosnia it's a virtual miracle that there has been no return to war and at least there has now been an election.", "And institutions are beginning to function.", "In Northern Ireland, in the Middle East we are better off than we were four years ago.", "There will always be problems in this whole world.", "But if we're moving in the right direction and America is leading, we're better off.", " Well it, after World War I, we had, you know, a policy of disengagement.", "Then from World War I to World War II we had sort of a compulsory engagement policy.", "Now I think we have a selective engagement policy.", "We have to determine when our interests are involved, not the United Nations' interests.", "And many of the things the President talked about, he turned over to the United Nations.", "They decided.", "He's deployed more troops than any president in history around the world.", "It's cost us billions and billions of dollars for peace-keeping operations.", "And it seems to me that when you make a decision, the decision is made by the President of the United States, by the Commander-in-Chief.", "He makes that decision when he commits young men or young women who are going to go round and defend our liberty and our freedom.", "That would be my position.", "Then I'm going to have a top down review at the Pentagon, not a bottom up review.", "I want a top down review to determine what our priorities are and what we should do in defense, and then follow that policy instead of this bottom up review with all the services fighting for the money.", "You know, the President said he was going to cut defense $60 billion, he cut defense $112 billion.", "Devastated states like California and others.", "And I think now we've got a problem.", "But the bottom line is, we are the strongest nation in the world.", "We provide the leadership and we're going to have to continue to provide the leadership, but let's do it on our terms when our interests are involved and not when somebody blows the whistle at the United Nations.", " Our military is the strongest military in the world.", "It is the strongest, best prepared, best equipped it has ever been.", "There is very little difference in the budget that I proposed and the Republican budget over the next six-year period.", "We are spending a lot of money to modernize our weapons system.", "I have proposed a lot of new investments to improve the quality of life for our soldiers, for our men and women in uniform, for their families, for their training.", "That is my solemn obligation.", "You ask when do you decide to deploy them.", "The interests of the American people must be at stake.", "Our values must be at stake.", "We have to be able to make a difference.", "And frankly we have to consider what the risks are to our young men and women in uniform.", "When I have sent the fleet into the Taiwan straits.", "When we've worked hard to end the Northern Korean nuclear threat.", "I believe the United States is at peace tonight in part because of the disciplined, careful, effective deployment of our military resources.", "You look at North Korea where they have enough plutonium to build six nuclear bombs.", "We've sort of distanced ourselves from our ally, South Korea.", "They lost about a million people in the war, the Korean War, the forgotten war.", "We lost 53,000 Americans.", "We shouldn't be doing any favors for North Korea.", "It's a closed society.", "We don't have any inspection.", "We don't know whether it's going to work or not, but we keep giving the incentives.", "We don't know what's going to happen.", "Here we have Cuba 90 miles from our shores, and what have we done, we passed the law that gave people a right to sue and the President postponed it for six months.", "And it seemed to me if you want to send a signal, you've got to send a signal, Mr. President.", "The sooner the better off we'll be, if you put tougher sanctions on Castro, not try to make it easier for him.", " Well, first of all, for the last four years we have worked had to put more and more pressure on the Castro government to bring about more openness and move toward democracy.", "In 1992, before I became President, the Congress passed the Cuba Democracy Act and I enforced it vigorously.", "We made the embargo tougher but we increased contacts people to people with the Cubans, including direct telephone service, which was largely supported by the Cuban-American community.", "Then Cuba shot down two of our planes and murdered four people in international air space.", "They were completely beyond the pale of the law, and I signed the Helms-Burton legislation.", "And the United States needs help from other countries.", "Nobody in the world agrees with our policy on Cuba now.", "But this law can be used as leverage to get other countries to help us to move Cuba to democracy.", "Every single country in Latin America, Central America and the Caribbean is a democracy tonight but Cuba.", "And if we stay firm and strong, we will be able to bring Cuba around as well.", "We have to be firm and strong.", "It will happen starting next January and maybe it can happen the balance of this year.", "We have not been firm and strong.", "You look at the poor people who still live in Cuba.", "It's a haven for drug smugglers and we don't have a firm policy when it comes to Fidel Castro.", "So Congress passes the law, the President signs it, like he does a lot of things.", "But he, like welfare reform, I'm going to sign it but I'm going to try to change it next year.", "A lot of these election-year conversions, the President talks about the drug money, and all the other things, all this antismoking campaign all happened in 1996.", "And I think the people viewing out there ought to go back and take a look at the record when he fought a balanced budget amendment.", "When he gave you that biggest tax increase in history; when he tried to take over your healthcare system.", "When he fought regulatory reform that cost the average family 6 to $7,000 a year.", "This is a serious business.", "It's about your family; it's about your business, and in this case it's about a firmer policy with Cuba.", " There were several off-the-subject quaffers in that litany.", "Let me just mention, Senator Dole voted for $900 billion in tax increases.", "His running mate Jack Kemp once said that Bob Dole never met a tax he didn't hike.", "And everybody knows, including the Wall Street Journal, hardly a friend of the Democratic party of this administration, that the '82 tax increase he sponsored in inflation-adjusted dollars was the biggest tax increase in American history.", "So we ought to at least get the facts out here on the table so we can know where to go from here.", "We were closing loopholes, we were going after big corporations.", "I know you probably would oppose it, Mr. President, but I think we should have a fairer system and a flatter system, and we'll have a fairer and flatter system and we're going to make the economic package work.", "Well, we finally passed the Kassebaum bill.", "The President was opposed to it in 1993.", "He wanted to give us this big system, that took over about one-seventh of the economy, that put on price controls, created all these state alliances, and would cost $1.5 trillion and force people into managed care, whether they wanted it or not.", "Most people want to see their own doctor.", "They're going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president.", "We won't threaten anybody.", "So we passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy, the Kennedy Kassebaum bill that will cover about 20 to 25 million people.", "We've been for that for four, five, six years.", "The President held it up.", "And even when it finally got near passage, Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days, because he wasn't satisfied with one provision.", "But it will cover preexisting conditions.", "If you change your job, you're going to be covered.", "So there are a lot of good things in this bill we should have done instead of trying this massive, massive takeover by the Federal government.", "But then of course we had a Democratic Congress and they didn't want to do that.", "Until we got a Republican Congress, we finally got action, I'm proud of my colleagues in the Republican Party for getting that done.", " Well, that sounds very good, but it's very wrong.", "Senator Dole remembers well that we actually offered not to even put in a healthcare bill in 1994, uh '93, but instead to work with the Senate Republicans and write a joint bill.", "The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that I signed will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change jobs or when somebody in their family's been sick.", "I think there's enough -- we're even looking at our tax cut proposal, our economic package.", "Another way you can do is to expand Medicaid.", "In America no one will go without healthcare, no one will go without food.", " Well, the president's own CIA director says Saddam is stronger now than he was.", "I don't understand extending the no-fly zone in the south when the trouble was in the north.", "And what we've done during the Bush administration, the Kurds were at the State Department, negotiating, trying to work their differences out.", "Now we've got all thousands and thousands of refugees.", "We're even shipping 3,000 Kurds to Guam.", "It involves Turkey.", "It's a real problem.", "Saddam is probably about as strong as he ever was.", "We shot, what, 44 cruise missiles, worth about a million-two a piece, and hit some radar, that repaired in a couple, three days.", "Did we inflict any damage?", "No.", "Did we have any allies helping?", "Well, we have Great Britain.", "They're always very loyal to us, and I appreciate that.", "And of course Kuwait.", "Even though they had to find out they had 5,000 troops coming, they didn't even understand that.", "We had to get their permission.", "We are supposed to be operating under a U.N. resolution.", "We did it without any of our allies that helped in the Gulf.", " Sometimes the United States has to act alone or at least has to act first.", "Sometimes we cannot let other countries have a veto on our foreign policy.", "I could not send soldiers into the north of Iraq, that would have been wrong.", "It could reduce Saddam Hussein's abilities to threaten Kuwait and his other neighbors again.", "That's what I did.", "I still believe it was the right thing to do.", "I've supported the President when I thought he was right on Bosnia.", "I supported him on NAFTA and GATT.", "So it's not that we always disagree.", "Others disagreed with us.", "But it seemed to me just as an observer that you know before you'd call somebody to America, you'd have some notion what the end result might be.", "Now maybe it's better just to get together and sit down and talk.", "Maybe that was the purpose.", "And I know talks have started again today.", "But again it's almost like an ad hoc foreign policy.", "It's ad hoc, it's sort of we get up in the morning and read the papers, what country's in trouble, we'll have a meeting.", "Now, to me that's not the strategy that I think people expect from America.", "I think we have lost credibility, and I say this very honestly without any partisanship.", "We've lost credibility around the world.", "Our allies know, -- they're not certain what we're going to do, what our reaction, what our response is going to be.", "But I do think that Saddam Hussein is stronger than he was.", "And I do believe that we didn't gain a great deal in the Mideast by bringing three of the four leaders, one refused to come, to Washington D.C.", "It is a very difficult environment.", "The feelings are very strong.", "There are extremists in all parts of the Middle East who want to kill that peace process.", "Prime Minister Rabin gave his life because someone in his own country literally hated him for trying to bring peace.", "I would like to have had a big, organized summit, but those people were killing each other, rapidly, innocent Arab children, innocent Israeli people, they were dying.", "And there is ,so much trust has broken down in the aftermath of the change of government.", "I felt that if I could just get the parties together to say let's stop the violence, start talking, commit to the negotiations, that would be a plus.", "Now today the Secretary of State is in the Middle East and they've started negotiations and all those leaders promised me they would not quit until they resolved the issues between them and got the peace process going forward again.", "The killing and tragedies had taken place.", "It shouldn't be politicized in any way by the President or by his opponent.", "And I don't intend to politicize it.", "I hope they talked and I hope they've reached some result and that the killing will end.", "That's why when I became President I was determined to kind of move beyond this whole stale debate that had gone on in Washington for too long to get this country moving again.", "And that's why we've got a country with ten and a half million more jobs, and record numbers of new businesses, and rising incomes, and falling crime rates, and welfare roll rates.", "That's why we're moving in the right direction.", "And I'm trying to emphasize that what I want to do is to continue to do that.", "That's why my balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy.", "That's why I want a tax cut for education and child rearing, but it's got to be paid for.", "That's why I want to continue the work we have done over partisan opposition, to work with communities to bring that crime rate down until our streets are all safe again.", "These are my commitments.", "I am very oriented toward the future.", "I think this election has to be geared toward the future.", "I think America's best days are still ahead, but we've got to build the right bridge.", " You know, the President reminds me sometimes of my brother Kenny, who is no longer alive.", "But Kenny was a great talker.", "And he used to tell me things that I knew were not quite accurate.", "So we always had a rule, we divided by six.", "Maybe in your case maybe just two.", "I also want a bridge to the truth.", "We have to tell the truth.", "We've got people watching tonight and listening tonight trying to find the truth.", "And the truth is, there is a lot wrong with America.", "We need a strong economic package; we need a tax cut; we need the $500 child credit, and we'll have that soon.", " I do not for a moment think I'm entitled to all the credit for all the good things that have happened in America.", "I also personally took responsibility tonight when Senator Dole asked me about the drug problem.", "But, you know, I think my ideas are better for the future.", "Senator Dole voted against student loans, against Headstart, against creating the Department of Education.", "I personally don't think that's the right kind of future for America, and I think we ought to take a different tack.", "I didn't favor it when it was in, started.", "I voted against it.", "It was a tribute after President Carter's election to the National Education Association who send a lot of delegates to the Democratic convention, who gives 99.5 percent of their money, Democrat Democrats, and the President, and a lot of the teachers send their kids to private schools or better public schools.", "So what we want to do is called opportunity scholarships.", "Now, some say, oh, you're a Republican, you can't be reaching out to these people.", "I've reached out to people all my life.", "I've worked on the food stamp program, proudly.", "And the WIC program, and the school lunch program with senators like George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey and others, to name a few of my Democratic friends.", "I'm not some extremist out here.", "I care about people.", "I have my own little foundation that's raised about $10 million for the disabled.", "I don't advertise it.", "Just did, haven't before.", "And I try to do a lot of things that I think might be helpful to people.", "I don't fault the President or the vice president for sending their children to private schools or better schools.", "I applaud them for it, I don't criticize them.", "But why shouldn't everybody have that choice.", "Why shouldn't low income Americans and low middle income Americans.", "I'm excited about it.", "It's going to be a big, big opportunity for a lot of people.", "We've worked hard to expand public school choice in my balanced budget bill.", "There's funds for 3,000 new schools created by teachers and parents, sometimes by business people, called charter schools that have no rules, they're free of bureaucracy and can only stay in existence if they perform and teach children.", "The ones that are out there are doing well.", "What I'm against is Senator Dole's plan to take money away from all the children we now help with limited Federal funds and help far fewer.", "If we're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be done at the local level or the state level.", "But Senator Dole has consistently opposed Federal help to education.", "He voted against student loans; he voted against my improved student loan plan; he voted against the National Service bill, against the HeadStart bill; he voted against our efforts in safe and drug-free schools.", "He voted against these programs, he does not believe it.", "That's the issue.", "I want to correct, the all these things I voted against, they were probably part of some big package that had a lot of pork in it or a lot of things that we shouldn't have had and we probably voted no.", "I've supported all the education programs.", "Let's give low income parents the same right that people of power and prestige have in America and let them go to better schools.", "Let's not, let's help, let's turn the schools back to the teachers and back to the parents and take it away from the National Education Association.", " I support school choice.", "I have advocated expansions of public school choice alternatives and I said the creation of 3,000 new schools that we are going to help the states to finance.", "But if you're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be determined by states in localities where they're raising and spending most of the money.", "Our schools are getting better, and our schools can be made to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level.", "I have been a strong force for reform.", "And, Senator, I remind you that a few years ago when I supported teacher testing while in my home state I was pretty well lambasted by the teachers association.", "I just don't believe we ought to be out there running down teachers and attacking them the way you did at the Republican convention.", "I think we ought to be lifting them up and moving our children forward.", "And let me just say that budget that you passed that I vetoed would have cut 50,000 kids out of Headstart.", "It would have eliminated the AmeriCorps plan and it would have cut back on student loans and scholarships.", "That's a fact.", "That's one of the big reasons I vetoed it.", "We need to be doing more in education, not less.", " Well, the AmeriCorps program, I must say, if that's one of your successes, I wouldn't speak about it too loudly.", "It costs about $27,000 to pay people to volunteer.", "We've got four million young people volunteering every year, the number hasn't gone down.", "And you pick out 20,000, whether they need the money or not, and they get paid for volunteering.", "I like young people.", "I like teachers.", "I'm a product of a public school.", "You attended a private school for some time in your life.", "When you get 99.5 percent of the money, we don't know what happened to the other .5 percent, we're looking for it, somebody got it, but it all went to Democrats.", "And this is part of that liberal establishment, one of those liberal things that you just can't do.", "You're for school uniforms and curfews and you're opposed to truancy.", "Some schools aren't safe.", "Some schools aren't even safe.", "Your choice is nothing.", "If

recovery program that we presented when I took office in 1981.", "So, the plan that we have had and that we are following is a plan that is based on growth in the economy, recovery without inflation, and reducing the share that the Government is taking from the gross national product, which has become a drag on the economy.", "Under that, this year, we have seen a $21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year, based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates.", "Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery.", "We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was.", "In the last 21 months, more than 6 million people have gotten jobs -- there have been created new jobs for those people to

result of excessive government spending.", "But, as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent.", "If the rate of increase in government spending can be held at 5 percent -- we're not far from there -- by 1989 that would have reduced the budget deficits down to a $30 or $40 billion level.", "At the same time, if we can have a 4-percent recovery continue through that same period of time, that will mean -- without an increase in tax rates -- that will mean $400 billion more in government revenues.", "And so, I think that the lines can meet.", "But the fact of it is, every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars.", "As a matter of fact, over 4 years, they've missed the mark by nearly $600 billion.", "We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983.", "It was $200 billion deficit instead.", "Virtually every economic analysis that I've heard of, including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a $263 billion deficit.", "In other words, it doesn't converge as the President suggests.", "It gets larger even with growth.", "What that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade.", "This is the worst trade year in American history by far.", "Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation.", "I get it down to a level below 2 percent of gross national product with a policy that's fair.",

leadership, and I think the American people know the difference.", " Absolutely, and I proposed over a hundred billion dollars in cuts in Federal spending over 4 years, but I am not going to cut it out of Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and things -- [applause] -- that people need.", "The rate of defense spending increase can be slowed.", "Certainly we can find a coffeepot that costs something less than $7,000.", "And there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in American life.", "And that's why the Congress, including the Republicans, have not gone along with the President's recommendations.", "I don't believe that Mr. Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget; he has a plan for raising taxes.", "And, as a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history took place 1977.", "And for the 5 years previous to our taking office, taxes doubled in the United States, and the budgets increased $318 billion.", "So, there is no ratio between taxing and balancing a budget.", "But I'm going to violate that rule and say \"never.''", "I will never stand for a reduction of the Social Security benefits to the people that are now getting them.", "And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut Social Security benefits by 25 percent -- reducing the adjustment for inflation, cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on Social Security, removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying -- with widows trying to get them through college.", "Everybody remembers that; people know what happened.", "There's a difference.", "I have fought for Social Security and Medicare and for things to help people who are vulnerable all my life, and I will do it as President of the United States.", "There is no question that we face this massive deficit, and almost everybody agrees unless we get it down, the chances for long-term, healthy growth are nil.", "And it's also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children.", "The President says it will disappear overnight because of some reason.", "No one else believes that's the case.", "I do, and I'm standing up to the issue with an answer that's fair.", "I think that's what leadership is all about.", "There's a difference between being a quarterback and a cheerleader, and when there's a real problem, a President must confront it.", "What I was referring to, of course, in the comment that you referred to was the situation in Lebanon.", "Now, for three occasions, one after another, our Embassies were assaulted in the same way by a truck with demolitions.", "Now, I believe that a President must command that White House and those who work for him.", "It's the toughest job on Earth, and you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done.", "And that's why in this campaign I'm telling you exactly what I want to do.", " Well, I think we're getting better all the time.", "He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for, and he must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world.", "And, incidentally, I might say that with regard to the 25-percent cut in Social Security -- before I get to the answer to your question -- the only 25-percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase, was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916.", "First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in.", "In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society -- that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society.", "Now, having that, I think also that in leadership -- well, I believe that you find people, positions such as I'm in who have the talent and ability to do the things that are needed in the various departments of government.", "I don't believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who's going to play tennis on the White House court.", "And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy, not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job.", "You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job.", "But I also believe something else about that.", "I don't want to hear them.", "I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people -- is it morally right?", "And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue.", " Our policy was not to cut subsidies.", "We are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people, and we're going to continue along that line.", "We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow, whether because of age or need.", "We have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country, and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need.", "The safety net is there, and we're taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country.", "The second fact is that the housing unit for senior citizens that the President dedicated in Buffalo was only made possible through a Federal assistance program for senior citizens that the President's budget sought to terminate.", "So, if he'd had his way, there wouldn't have been any housing project there at all.", "And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign.", "And 3 days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said, Social Security, we know, is broke.", "Indeed, we had to borrow $17 billion to pay the checks.", "And then I asked for a bipartisan commission, which I'd asked for from the beginning, to sit down and work out a solution.", "And so, the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation, and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century.", "And I don't believe -- I believe, I should say, as Lincoln once said, that I could not -- I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others.", "And I do resort to prayer.", "At the same time, however, I have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign -- or religion a part of that campaign.", "As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr. Mondale's running mate said I wasn't a good Christian.", "So, it does play a part in my life.", "I have no hesitancy in saying so.", "And, as I say, I don't believe that I could carry on unless I had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered.", "I have gone to church regularly all my life, and I started to here in Washington.", "I know the threats that are made against me.", "We all know the possibility of terrorism.", "And, therefore, I don't feel -- and my minister knows this and supports me in this position -- I don't feel that I have a right to go to church, knowing that my being there could cause something of the kind that we have seen in other places, in Beirut, for example.", "And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency.", "I have a deep religious faith.", "Our family does.", "It is fundamental.", "It's probably the reason that I'm in politics.", "I think our faith tells us, instructs us, about the moral life that we should lead.", "And I think we're all together on that.", "All history tells us that that's a mistake.", "That's why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians.", "And I think if we want to continue -- as I do -- to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it.", "What I object to -- [applause] -- what I object to -- what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others.", "The fact that the faith speaks to us and that we are moral people, hopefully, I accept and rejoice in.", "I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there.", "And they have been using these things to have government, through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion.", "A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they can't do it because it's school property.", "These are they types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation, and I am opposed to that.", "I have appointed one member to the Supreme Court: Sandra Day O'Connor.", "I'll stand on my record on that.", "And if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, I'll do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her.", "The American people want arms control.", "They don't want this arms race.", "And they don't want this deadly new effort to bring weapons into the heavens.", "And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world.", "And if it won't come down, the economy's going to slow down, maybe go into a recession.", "The American people want this environment protected.", "The American people want their children educated.", "They want to get our edge back in science, and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap that's widening between the United States and Europe and Japan.", "The American people want to keep opening doors.", "They want those civil rights laws enforced.", "They want the equal rights amendment ratified.", "They want equal pay for comparable effort for women.", "I think as you make the case, the American people will increasingly come to our cause.", "I've said it's going to take some work.", "I think the American people will draw their own conclusions.", "Secondly, I've said that I will not support the cuts in Social Security and Medicare and the rest that the President has proposed.", "The President answers that it didn't happen or, if it did, it was resolved later in a commission.", "As the record develops, I think it's going to become increasingly clear that what I am saying and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go, and the comparison of approaches is such that I think will lead to further strength.", "I promised, when we took office, that we would reduce inflation.", "We have, to one-third of what it was.", "I promised that we would reduce taxes.", "We did, 25 percent across the board.", "But at least it took that burden away from them.", "I said that we would create jobs for our people, and we did -- 6 million in the last 20 or 21 months.", "I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons.", "We have done that.", "All of the things that I said we would do, from inflation being down, interest rates being down, unemployment falling, all of those things we have done.", "And I think this is something the American people see.", "I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education -- on excellence in education.", "We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth.", "All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.", "So, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw: The leadership isn't taking us where we want to go.", " There are tasks that government legitimately should enforce and tasks that government performs well, and you've named some of them.", "Crime has come down the last 2 years, for the first time in many, many decades that it has come down -- or since we've kept records -- 2 consecutive years, and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that we've had.", "Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment.", "And now we're going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks.", "We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges.", "I was chairman of \"Minnesotans for Kennedy;'' President Reagan was chairman of a thing called \"Democrats for Nixon.''", "Now, maybe we made a wrong turn with Kennedy, but I'll be proud of supporting him all of my life.", "The President just said that his government is shrinking.", "It's not.", "It's now the largest peacetime government ever in terms of the take from the total economy.", "And instead of retreating -- instead of being strong where we should be strong, he wants to make it strong and intervene in the most private and personal questions in American life.", "That's where government should not be.", "And so, my change had come earlier than that.", "I hadn't gotten around to reregistering as yet.", "I found that was rather difficult to do.", "But I finally did it.", "The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done.", "All of these things are presently being rectified, and I think that we are going to salvage the farmers.", "As a matter of fact, there has been less than one-quarter of 1 percent of foreclosures of the 270,000 loans from government that the farmers have.", " I have believed that in the appointment of judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they respect the sanctity of human life.", "Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life.", "But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is -- there's been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government.", "With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it's a problem of the Constitution.", "I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us.", "And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive.", "We have seen premature births that are now grown-up, happy people going around.", "In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor -- signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder.", "Now, isn't it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child, and it was abortion and not murder, but if somebody else does it, that's murder?", "And it used the term \"death of the unborn child.''", "So, this has been my feeling about abortion, that we have a problem now to determine -- and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being.", "Our laws against murder are State laws.", "So, I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this.", "As I say, I feel that we have a problem here to resolve.", "And no one has approached it from that matter.", "It does not happen that the church that I belong to had that as part of its dogma.", "I know that some churches do.", "Now, it is a sin if you're taking a human life.", "At the same time, in our Judeo-Christian tradition, we recognize the right of taking a human life in self-defense.", "And therefore, I've always believed that a mother, if medically it is determined that her life is at risk if she goes through with the pregnancy, she has a right then to take the life of even her own unborn child in defense of her own.", "The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest.", "I think it cannot work, won't work, and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law.", "Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them.", "The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do.", "I think these questions are inherently personal and moral, and every individual instance is different.", "Every American should be aware of the seriousness of the step.", "But there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do.", "Now, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion.", "Somebody went to a woman and nearly killed her.", "That's always been a serious crime and always should be a serious crime.", "Do we really want those decisions made by judges who've been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty?", "I don't think so, and I think it's going in exactly the wrong direction.", "We haven't felt so insecure that we've reached for the club of state to have our point of view.", "It's been a good instinct.", "And we're the most religious people on Earth.", " President Reagan, as Governor of California, signed a bill which is perhaps the most liberal proabortion bill of any State in the Union.", "And it's a personal and private, moral judgment.", "I don't know the answer to when life begins.", "And it's not that simple, either.", "You've got another life involved.", "And if it's rape, how do you draw moral judgments on that?", "If it's incest, how do you draw moral judgments on that?", "Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment?", "It won't work.", "Now, I'm not capable, and I don't think you are, any of us, to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life.", "I am simply saying that I believe that that's where the effort should be directed -- to make that determination.", "I don't think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition.", "There are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who can't have them any other way.", "But the question is whether this other option proposed by the President should be pursued.", "And I don't agree with it.", "And the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo, which has caused farm exports to drop 20 percent.", "It's been a big failure.", "I opposed the grain embargo in my administration.", "I'm opposed to these policies as well.", "Under the 1981 tax bill, people making $200,000 a year got $60,000 in tax relief over 3 years, while people making $30,000 a year, all taxes considered, got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up.", "That's why my proposal protects everybody from $25,000 a year or less against any tax increases, and treats those $70,000 and under in a way that is more beneficial than the way the President proposes with a sales tax or a flat tax.", "Well, the other day, Vice President Bush disclosed his tax returns to the American people.", "In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes.", "In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12.8 percent in taxes.", "I believe we need some fairness.", "And that's why I've proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people who've already got no relief or actually got a tax increase.", "They hit middle- and moderate-income Americans and leave wealthy Americans largely untouched.", "I don't think we can do that for a few years.", "But at some point, we want to do that as well.", "[Laughter] I don't have a plan to tax -- or increase taxes.", "I'm not going to increase taxes.", "Now, I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed; it's that government is overfed.", "And I think that most of our people -- this is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up.", "Now, I don't think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesn't work out that way.", "Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also.", "I don't foresee those things happening, so I say with great confidence I'm not going to go for a tax.", "All of those are legally deductions, deductible in computing your tax, and it was a 1-year thing with him.", "And, no, I never proposed any $20 billion should come out of Medicare; I have proposed that the program we must treat with that particular problem.", "And maybe part of that problem is because during the 4 years of the Carter-Mondale administration medical costs in this country went up 87 percent.", "It had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs.", "We are spending now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980.", "We're spending a third more on all of the -- well, all of the programs of human service.", "We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits.", "We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy.", "But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans.", "We didn't think that was right.", "We're not going to rest and not going to be happy until every person in this country who wants a job can have one, until the recovery is complete across the country.", " Number one, we've got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed.", "The other thing is, we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth.", "There is no question that the poor are worse off.", "I think the President genuinely believes that they're better off.", "Now, we need a tight budget, but there's no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and they're hurting.", "There's another part of the lopsided economy that we're in today, and that is that these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports.", "We are now $120 billion of imports, 3 million jobs lost, and farmers are having their worst year.", "That's another reason to get the deficit down.", " I think the American people want to make certain that that dollar is wisely spent.", "I think they stand for civil rights.", "I know they're all for education in science and training, which I strongly support.", "They want these young people to have a chance to get jobs and the rest.", "I think the business community wants to get involved.", "I think they're asking for new and creative ways to try to reach it with everyone involved.", "I think that's part of it.", "I'm opposed to that, too.", "And while they were coming down, the deficits had started their great increase.", "They were going up.", "Now, if there was a connection I think that there would be a different parallel between deficits getting larger and interest rates going down.", "I think it can only be that they're anticipating or hope -- expecting, not hoping, that maybe we don't have a control of inflation and it's going to go back up again.", "Well, it isn't going to go back up.", "We're going to see that it doesn't.", " Mr. President, if I heard you correctly, you said that these deficits don't have anything to do with interest rates.", "There's no way of glossing around that.", "And the result is interest costs that have never been seen before in terms of real charges, and it's attributable to the deficit.", "Every chairman of the Finance and Ways and Means Committee, Republican leaders in the Senate and the House are telling you that.", "That deficit is ruining the long-term hopes for this economy.", "It's causing high interest rates.", "It's ruining us in trade.", "It's given us the highest small business failure in 50 years.", "The economy is starting downhill with housing failure -- --", "I think the President has done some things to raise the sense of spirit, morale, good feeling in this country, and he's entitled to credit for that.", "I think in education, when he lectured the country about the importance of discipline, I didn't like it at first, but I think it helped a little bit.", "But now we need both that kind of discipline and the resources and the consistent leadership that allows this country to catch up in education and science and training.", " Without any doubt, I have stood up and told the American people that that $263 billion deficit must come down.", "And I've done what no candidate for President has ever done, I told you before the election what I'd do.", "It was once called voodoo economics.", "Yes, we have a $263 billion deficit.", "This is how I'm going to get it done.", "I'll tell you what I think has been the most outrageous thing in political dialog, both in this campaign and the one in '82.", "And that is the continued discussion and claim that somehow I am the villain who is going to pull the Social Security checks out from those people who are dependent on them.", "But why it is outrageous is because, for political advantage, every time they do that, they scare millions of senior citizens who are totally dependent on Social Security, have no place else to turn.", "And they have to live and go to bed at night thinking, \"Is this true?", "Is someone going to take our check away from us and leave us destitute?''", "And I don't think that that should be a part of political dialog.", "But I tell you also now, Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit.", "Social Security is totally funded by the payroll tax levied on employer and employee.", "So, Social Security has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit.", "Now, again, to get to whether I am depending on magic, I think I have talked in straight economic terms about a program of recovery that I was told wouldn't work.", "And then, after it worked, I was told that lowering taxes would increase inflation.", "And none of these things happened.", "It is working, and we're going to continue on that same line.", "As to what we might do, and find in further savings cuts, no, we're not going to starve the hungry.", "But we have 2,478 specific recommendations from a commission of more than 2,000 business people in this country, through the Grace commission, that we're studying right now -- and we've already implemented 17 percent of them -- that are recommendations as to how to make government more efficient, more economic.", "Remember, there was a trillion dollars in debt before we got here.", "That's got to be paid by our children and grandchildren, too, if we don't do it.", "And the American people don't have the slightest clue about what President Reagan will do about these deficits.", "[Laughter] And yet, that's the most important single issue of our time.", "But I will say as a Democrat, I was a real piker, Mr. President.", "In 1979 we ran a $29 billion deficit all year.", "This administration seems to run that every morning.", "And the result is exactly what we see.", "This economy is starting to run downhill.", "Housing is off.", "Last report on new purchases, it's the lowest since 1982.", "Growth is a little over 3 percent now.", "Many people are predicting a recession.", "And the flow of imports into this country is swamping the American people.", "We've got to deal with this problem, and those of us who want to be your President should tell you now what we're going to do, so you can make a judgment.", "The question, I think, should be enlarged.", "Is America better off than it was 4 years ago?", "And I believe the answer to that has to also be \"yes.''", "I promised a new beginning.", "So far, it is only a beginning.", "The first half of '84 it's up 8\\1/2\\ percent.", "Productivity in the first half of 1980 was down a minus 2 percent.", "Today it is up a plus 4 percent.", "Personal earnings after taxes per capita have gone up almost $3,000 in these 4 years.", "By 1980 that same person was $500 below the poverty line.", "We have restored much of our economy.", "With regard to business investment, it is higher than it has been since 1949.", "So, there seems to be no shortage of investment capital.", "We have, as I said, cut the taxes, but we have reduced inflation, and for 2 years now it has stayed down there, not at double digit, but in the range of 4 or below.", "We believe that we had also promised that we would make our country more secure.", "Yes, we have an increase in the defense budget.", "But back then we had planes that couldn't fly for lack of spare parts or pilots.", "We had navy vessels that couldn't leave harbor because of lack of crew or, again, lack of spare parts.", "Today we're well on our way to a 600-ship navy.", "We have 543 at present.", "We have -- our military, the morale is high.", "I think the people should understand that two-thirds of the defense budget pays for pay and salary, or pay and pension.", "And then you add to that food and wardrobe, and all the other things, and you only have a small portion going for weapons.", "But I am determined that if ever our men are called on, they should have the best that we can provide in the manner of tools and weapons.", "There has been reference to expensive spare parts, hammers costing $500.", "Well, we are the ones who found those.", "I think we've given the American people back their spirit.", "I think there's an optimism in the land and a patriotism, and I think that we're in a position once again to heed the words of Thomas Paine, who said: \"We have it in our power to begin the world over again.''", "Well, if you're wealthy, you're better off.", "If you're middle income, you're about where you were.", "And if you're modest income, you're worse off.", "That's what the economists tell us.", "I believe that if we ask those questions that bear on our future, not just congratulate ourselves but challenge us to solve those problems, you'll see that we need new leadership.", "I would rather lose a campaign about decency than win a campaign about self-interest.", "I don't think this nation is composed of people who care only for themselves.", "America is a fair society, and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him.", "I believe there's fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system.", "I believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment.", "And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful.", "These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price.",

Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, \"We are great, but we can be greater.''", "We can be better if we face our future, rejoice in our strengths, face our problems, and by solving them, build a better society for our children.", " I think we've seen a deterioration of values.", "I think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have condemned.", "For a while, as I recall, it even seems to me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana and other drugs, and I think that's all wrong.", "So we've seen a deterioration in values, and one of the things that I think we should do about it in terms of cause is to instill values into the young people in our schools.", "We got away, we got into this feeling that value- free education was the thing.", "And I don't believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use.", "But we've got to do a lot better on education, and we have to do, be tougher on those who commit crimes.", "We've got to get after the users more.", "We have to change this whole culture.", "You know, I saw a movie - \"Crocodile Dundee.\"", "And I saw the cocaine scene treated with humor, as though this was a humorous little incident.", "And it's bad.", "Everybody ought to be in this thing.", "Entertainment industry, people involved in the schools, education.", "And it isn't a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem.", "But we have got to instill values in these young people.", "But I think we're all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.", "But it's important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top.", "That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values

16 year old girl coming up to me, desperate, addicted, dependent, saying, Governor, I need help.", "We're providing that young woman with help.", "Values begin at the top, in the White House.", "Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.", "But we also have to take demand seriously.", "You know, we have five percent of the world's

again do business with a drug-running Panamanian dictator, that we never again funnel aid to the contras through convicted drug dealers.", "Values begin at the top, in the White House.", "Those are

begin early, in the first, second and third grade, before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very, very dangerous substances.", "I guess the question I would ask of Mr. Bush is how we instill those values, how we create this environment for the drug free schools that we want in this country.", "If he or representatives of the administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy, or don't pursue that connection in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an example to our kids all over the country.", "And what I'm about to say is unclassified.", "Seven administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega.", "It was the Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man to justice.", "And so I think it's about time we get this

administrations.", "First, I've suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don't need and we can't afford.", "I've also suggested that there are weapons systems that we should proceed on, and I've outlined those in detail.", "Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit.", "Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down.", "And, finally, we've got to go out there and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren't being

gains cut.", "It's not going to cost the government money.", "It's going to increase revenues to the federal government, and it's going to create jobs.", " I think it's the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down.", "And presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down, but we've got to get the Democrats - Congress under control.", "They do all the spending, they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime.", "He has to operate in Massachusetts under a balanced budget proviso.", "I would like a balanced budget amendment.", "It is that we are continuing to spend too much.", "So, my formula says grow at the rate of inflation.", "Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending.", "Spending was only up something like 4 percent.", "So, it isn't that we're taking too little - from taxpayer - we're spending too much still.", " Well, I hope all of those Americans out there who are watching us, listening to us and trying to make up their mind about which one of us ought to be president of the United States listen to the Vice President very carefully.", "What he's proposing after over a trillion in new

past the first catastrophic health bill.", "But we've got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work.", "So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program.", "And I think then you're going to see that people are put out of work.", "All these programs - and this cost on his - is - was - I saw an estimate, I'd love to know what he thinks, $35 - $40 billion - and it seems to me that somebody pays that.", "There isn't any such thing as something free out there.", "So, I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid

will provide broad education and prevention, which will provide sensitive and caring treatment for the victims of AIDS.", "I think we have to demonstrate some flexibility and I think the FDA is attempting to do so now in trying to make it possible for new and experimental drugs to be available to people who are at risk at AIDS and I would hope that we could bring that kind of a policy to bear beginning in January.", "And I would encourage the current administration to proceed with that kind of flexibility where it's appropriate and where it's done carefully and responsibly.", "But we

liberal or conservative idea.", "I see an involvement by a thousand points of light.", "I see the funding that is required, and I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill.", "They gave it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work.", "And we're on the track on this one.", "I'd say around 30 percent.", "And I think maybe we could look back over our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all those mental patients out.", "Maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them.", "Because there is a major problem there.", "A lot of them are mentally sick.", "And we've got to attend to them.", "But fully, my short range answer is fully fund that McKinney Act.", "And when you do that, you've have homeless families.", "We didn't have two and a half million, or three million homeless people living on streets and in doorways in this country ten years ago.", "We've got to begin to get back to the business of building and rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in this country; housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy.", "We've got communities in this country increasingly where our own kids can't afford to live in the communities that they grew up in.", "That's an essential commitment.", "And I think the housing community is ready.", "And while I'm all for the McKinney bill, that, by itself, simply won't do.", "We've got to have a president that can lead on this issue, that can work with the Congress, and I'm prepared to do so.", "This is one of the most important priorities that faces this country.", "And it's all a question of what our priorities are.", "Mr. Bush talked about values.", "I agree with him.", "I think so.", "We went out and built housing.", "The government was very much involved; so was the housing industry; so was the banking industry; so were housing advocates; so were non-profit agencies; so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing.", "Now, that's the kind of leadership that I want to provide as president of the United States.", "This isn't a question of a little charity for the homeless.", "This is a question of organizing the housing community.", "Washington, by itself, can't do it all.", "We shouldn't expect that.", "It will require some funds, John.", "And we ought to be prepared to provide those funds.", "But that, too, will require some choices.", "Mr. Bush wants to spend billions and trillions on Star Wars.", "Well, that's a choice we have to make, isn't it?", "Do we spend money on that weapon system in the billions and trillions, or is providing some decent and affordable housing for families of this country something that is at least as important and probably more so.", "Because it's so essential to our economic strength and to our future.", "Now, that's the kind of presidency I believe in.", "And simply to say, well, the McKinney bill will do it just doesn't do.", "We need a president who will lead on this issue, who has had experience on this issue.", "It's the kind of priority that will be at the top of our list beginning in January of 1989.", " I think the governor is blurring housing and the homeless.", "Ten days before I took the oath of office as president they were 21 and a half percent.", "Now, how does that grab you for increasing housing?", "Housing is up.", "We are serving a million more families now.", "But we're not going to do it in that old Democratic, liberal way of trying to build more bricks and mortars.", "Go out and take a look at St. Louis at some of that effort.", "It is wrong.", "I favor home ownership.", "I want to see more vouchers.", "I want to see control of some of these projects, and I want to keep the interest rates down.", "But if we spend and spend and spend, that is going to wrap up the housing market, and we'll go right back to the days of the misery index and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome - thank God for the United States on that one.", " No, I don't think there is.", "There are two very different issues here, and they've got to be dealt with separately.", "I'm opposed to the death penalty.", "I think everybody knows that.", "I'm also very tough on violent crime.", "And that's one of the reasons why my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in America.", "It's one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in the country.", "It's one of the reasons why we have a drug education and prevention program that is reaching out and helping youngsters all over our state, the kind of thing I want to do as president of the United States.", "The issue of abortion is a very difficult issue, one that I think that we all have to wrestle with, we have to come to terms with.", "I don't favor abortion.", "I don't think it's a good thing.", "I don't think most people do.", "The question is who makes the decision.", "And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.", " Well, the Massachusetts furlough program was unique.", "It was the only one in the nation that furloughed murderers who had not served enough time to be eligible for parole.", "The federal program doesn't do that.", "No other state programs do that.", "And I favor the death penalty.", "I know it's tough and honest people can disagree.", "And I do believe it would be inhibiting.", "And so I am not going to furlough men like Willie Horton, and I would meet with their, the victims of his last escapade, the rape and the brutalization of the family down there in Maryland.", "And so we have a fundamental difference on this one.", "And I think most people know my position on the sanctity of life.", "I favor adoption.", "I do not favor abortion.", " I haven't sorted out the penalties.", "But I do know, I do know that I oppose abortion.", "And I favor adoption.", "And you see, yes, my position has evolved.", "And it's continuing to evolve, and it's evolving in favor of life.", "And I have had a couple of exceptions that I support - rape, incest and the life of the mother.", "As I've seen abortions sometimes used as a birth control device, for heavens sakes.", "We certainly do.", " Well, I think what the vice president is saying is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this decision.", "It's as simple as that.", "I don't think it's enough to come before the American people who are watching us tonight and say, well, I haven't sorted it out.", "This is a very, very difficult and fundamental decision that all of us have to make.", "Let me simply say that I think it has to be the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs that makes that decision, and I think that's the right approach, the right decision, and I would hope by this time that Mr. Bush had sorted out this issue and come to terms with it as I have.", "I respect his right to disagree with me.", "But I think it's important that we have a position, that we take it, and we state it to the American people.", "But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible.", "I do strongly support the WIC program.", "I think it is good.", "I think part of the answer to this haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid, to challenge the states, and maybe we're going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of these.", "I think they understand my commitment to helping them in the neighborhoods.", "And so it's a combination of these things.", "The people that are out there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and schools, the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty.", "I'm for Head Start and moving that up.", "And I've already made a proposal - and yes, it will cost some money.", "But I favor that.", "So these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I don't think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program.", "It's cut federal aid to education; it's cut Pell grants and loans to close the door to college opportunity on youngsters all over this country.", "And that, too, is a major difference between the vice president and me.", "We have a great many people, hundreds of thousands of people living on public assistance in this country.", "The 50 governors of this nation have proposed to the Congress that we help those families to get off of welfare, help those youngsters, help their mothers to become independent and self-sufficient.", "It's taken months and months and months to get Mr. Bush and the administration to support that legislation, and they're still resisting.", "That's the way you help people.", "I know what strong political leadership is.", "I know what's happened over the course of the past eight years.", "These programs have been cut and slashed and butchered, and they've hurt kids all over this country.", " Well, I said a few minutes ago, Peter, that you could improve the lives of families and youngsters and save money at the same time.", "Welfare reform is one way to do it.", "In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very unwisely.", "One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance.", "And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I don't think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital.", "So these are the ways that you help families, you help youngsters to live better lives, and more decent lives.", "Were ready to go to work at the state and local level, all of us.", "I know the private sector is.", "But it takes presidential leadership.", "It takes a commitment to being involved and the leading.", "And that's the kind of presidency I want to lead.", " What troubles me is that when I talk of the voluntary sector and a thousand points of light and a thousand different ways to help on these problems, the man has just said he doesn't understand what I'm talking about.", "This is the problem I have with the big spending liberals.", "They think the only way to do it is for the federal government to do it all.", "The fact happens to be that education spending is up by the federal government; it is up.", "It is not down.", "The federal government spends seven percent of the total on education, and the rest of the state governments and local governments and the thousand points of lightened I'm talking about private schools and private church schools and things of this nature--are putting up 93 percent.", "But the federal spending for education is up, and I want to be the education president, because I want to see us do better.", "We've gotten away fro values and the fundamentals.", "And I would like to urge the school superintendents and the others around the country to stand up now and keep us moving forward on a path towards real excellence.", "And we can do it.", "But it\u00cf\u20acs not going to be dedicated by some federal bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.", "Of course that's a charge that's always made against any governor who runs for the presidency.", "I think it was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980.", "Its not the amount of time you spend in Washington.", "It's not the length of your resume.", "It's your strength, it's your values, it's the quality of the people you pick.", "It's your understanding of the forces of change that are sweeping the world, and whether or not you're in a position to provide leadership to make those forces of change work for us and not against us.", "The vice president has a long resume.", "But it didn't stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah.", "His experience didn't prevent him from participating or involving or in some way being involved in the relationship between this government and Mr. Noriega and drug trafficking in Panama.", "He went to Philippines in the early 80\u00cf\u20acs and commended Ferdinand Macros for his commitment to democracy.", "And he continues to support a failed policy in Central America which is getting worse and worse, and which has in fact increased Cuban and Soviet influence in that region.", "So I don't believe that the fact you've got that long resume or had that experience is the real question.", "The question is values; the question is strength, the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provided.", "I'm ready to provide that leadership.", "I want to be the commander in chief of this country.", "But I don't think it's just experience that makes the difference.", "It's strength; it's values.", "The governor was for a nuclear freeze that would have locked in a thousand Soviet intermediate nuclear force weapons and zero for the West.", "And because we didn't listen to the freeze advocates, and strengthen the defense of this country, we now have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age.", "Now, we're sitting down and talking to the Soviets about strategic arms, and he wants to do away with the Midgetman and the MX, the modernization or our nuclear capability.", "That is not the way you deal with the Soviets.", "I've met Mr. Gorbachev.", "Met Mr. Shevardnadze and talked substance with him the other day.", "These people are tough.", "But now we have a chance.", "And now we are back, because we have strengthened the defenses of this country, and believe me, I don't want to see us return to those days.", " And he just lifted martial law.", "And he just called for new elections.", " I don't think it's a question of eliminating.", "I mean, there's plenty of them that I oppose, but what I am not going to do, when we are negotiating with the Soviet Union, sitting down talking to Mr. Gorbachev about how we achieve a 50 percent reduction in our strategic weapons, I'm not going to give away a couple of aces I that very tough card game.", "I'm simply not going to do that.", "And under me, when I lead this country, the secretary of defense is going to have to make the choices, between how we keep, how we protect the survivability of our nuclear deployment on the Midgetman missile, or on the Minuteman, whatever it is.", "We're going to have to-the MX.", "We're going to have to do that.", "Of course we're going to have to make some determination on this, and we're going to have to make it on the convention forces.", "But now we've got a very good concept called competitive strategies.", "We will do what we do best.", "It's a strategy that we've been working on for a couple of years.", "It is going to take us to much better advantage in conventional forces.", "I want to be the president that gets conventional forces balance.", "I want to be the one to banish chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth.", "But you have to have a little bit of experience to know where to start.", "And I think I've had that.", "I didn't hear, John, exactly where he was going to cut and what he was going to do.", "But I know this, we have serious financial problems in this country.", "We've piled up over a trillion dollars in debt and the next president of the United States is going to have to make some choices.", "Mr. Bush wants to spend billions on Star Wars.", "I thought the administration was opposed to the Midgetman.", "I thought the administration was at the negotiating table in Geneva suggesting that we ban mobile missile systems entirely.", "I'm for the Stealth, I'm for the D-5, I'm for going ahead with the advance Cruise missile.", "But I don't think we need these other systems.", "I don't think we need them to remain strong.", "We've got to move ahead with the strategic arms negotiation process, with the comprehensive test ban treaty and with negotiations leading to conventional force reduction in Europe with deeper cuts on the Soviet side and Senator Bentsen and I will pursue that policy.", " What I think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika and glasnost, welcome them, but keep our eyes open.", "Be cautious.", "Because the Soviet change is not fully established yet.", "Yes, I think it's fine to do business with them.", "And now the Soviet Union seems to be walking down that same path.", "We should encourage that.", "We ought to say this is good.", "But where I differ with my opponent is I am not going to make unilateral cuts in our strategic defend systems or support some freeze when they have superiority.", "I'm not going to do that, because I think the jury is still out on the Soviet experiment.", "And the interesting place-one of the things that fascinates me about this perestroika and glasnost is wheats going to happen in Eastern Europe.", "And I think we have enormous opportunity for trade.", "I don't want to go back to the Carter grain embargo on the Soviets.", "We are once again reliable suppliers and I would never use food as a political tool like our predecessors did.", "But all I'm suggesting is let's not be na\u00c3\u00afve in dealing with the Soviets and make a lot of unilateral cuts hoping against hope that they will match our bid.", "And if we haven't learned from the negotiating history on that, we'll never learn.", "The freeze people were wrong.", "The Reagan-Bush administration was right.", " It was a very different George Bush who was talking much more sympathetically about the freeze in the spring of 1982 than he is today.", "And you were right then, George, when you said it was no time for partisan demagoguery.", "Nobody is suggesting that we unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce our strength, of course not.", "We have serious differences with the Soviet Union.", "We have very fundamental differences about human rights, democracy and our basic system, our basic view of human beings and of what life is all about.", "But there are opportunities there now.", "Senator Bentsen and I have a plan for the 1990\u00cf\u20acs and beyond.", "Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle do not.", "And we want to pursue that plan in a way which will bring down the level of nuclear armament, will build a more stable and more peaceful world while making choices here at home.", "Let's not forget that our national security and our economic security go hand in hand.", "We cannot be strong militarily when we're teeter-tottering on top of a mountain of debt which has been created in the past eight years.", "That's why we need a Democratic administration in Washington in 1989.", " No, there's been no change of heart.", "I said from the beginning that we ought to continue research into the strategic system at about the level that was added in 1983, that's about a billion dollars a year.", "But I don't know of any reputable scientist who believed that this system, at least as originally conceived could possibly work, this notion of some kind of astrodome over ourselves that could protect us from enemy attack.", "It makes real sense.", "And as a matter of fact, the system that the administration is now talking about is very different from the one that was originally proposed in 1983.", "So, I'm for continued research, but I also want strong conventional forces.", "We know where they're cutting.", "We know where you're cutting right now.", "You're cutting into the fiber and muscle of our conventional forces.", "You're cutting back on maintenance and equipment.", "Coast Guard cutters tied up at the dock this summer, not patrolling.", "You have to make choices.", "We're not making those choices.", "And to spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr. Bush apparently wants to, although, he, himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately-on Star Wars-in my judgment makes no sense at all.", "We need a strong, credible, effective nuclear deterrent.", "We have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads right now on land, on sea and in the air, enough to blow up the Soviet Union forty times over.", "They have about 12,000.", "So, we've got to move forward with those negotiations, get the level of strategic weapons down.", "But to continue to commit billions to this system makes no sense at all and I think Mr. Bush has been reconsidering his position over the course of the past few weeks.", "That's-at least that's what I read.", "Maybe he'll tell us where he stand on it tonight.", " I'm not reconsidering my position.", "He is the man on conventional forces that wants to eliminate two carrier battle groups.", "The armed forces, the conventional forces of the United States have never been more ready.", "Every single one of the Joint Chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness is in an historic high.", " He's got to get this thing more clear.", "I will fully research it, go forward as fast as we can.", "We've set up the levels of funding and when it is deployable, I will deploy it.", "That is my position on SDI and it's never wavered a bit.", " Peter, it's one of the most agonizing decisions a president has to make.", "These are American citizens, we care deeply about them.", "Because if you do, it's an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us.", "And that's the tragedy of the Iran/Contra scandal.", "We've got to be tough on international terrorism.", "We've got to treat it as international crime.", "We've got to attack at all points, we've go to use undercover operations.", "We have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camps, we have to work closely with our allies to make sure that they're working with us and we with them and we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of international terrorism.", "That was a tragic mistake that we made, a mistake that Mr. Bush made and others made and it should never ever be made again.", " I wrote the anti-terrorist report for this government.", "It is the best anti-terrorist report written.", "Yes, we shouldn't trade arms for hostages.", "But we have made vast improvements in our anti-terrorism.", "And my opponent was unwilling to support that action.", " That's not true.", " And since that action, terrorist action against the United States citizens have gone down.", " That's not true.", "Clearly nobody's going to think the president started out thinking he was going to trade arms for hostages.", "That is a very serious charge against the president.", "The matter has been thoroughly looked into.", " Now we have a chance.", "And, so, I think that I'd leave it right there and say that you judge on the whole record.", "Now, I've told you what the intelligence briefing he received said about that.", " Well, the matter of judgment is very important.", "And I think it's important to understand what happened here.", "A report on international terrorism chaired by the Vice President was released and made some very specific recommendations about how to deal with terrorism.", "They were ignored.", "The Vice President ignored them.", "He says mistakes were made.", "Very serious mistakes in judgment were made.", "We're not going to make those kinds of mistakes.", "You cannot make concessions to terrorists.", "If you do, you invite the taking of more hostages.", "That's a basic principle.", "It was ignored in that case and it was a very very serious mistake in judgment.", "And I believe that he will be outstanding.", "And he took a tremendous pounding and everybody now knows that he took a very unfair pounding.", "And I'd like each person to say did I jump to conclusions running down rumors that were so outrageous and so brutal.", "And he's kept his head up.", "And he will do very very well.", "And he has my full confidence and he'll have the confidence of people that are in their 30\u00cf\u20acs and 40\u00cf\u20acs and more.", "So, judge the man on his record not on the-lot of rumors and innuendo and trying to fool around with his name.", "And he'll do very well when we get into the debates.", " Well, when it comes to ridicule, George, you win a gold medal.", "I think we can agree on that in the course of this campaign.", " No, I think the debate ought to be between you and Lloyd.", " I think the American people have a right to judge us on this question, on how we picked a running mate, a person who is a heartbeat away from the presidency.", "I picked Lloyd Bentsen, distinguished, strong, mature, a leader in the Senate, somebody whose qualifications nobody has questioned.", "Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle.", "I doubt very much that Dan Quayle was the best qualified person for that job.", "And as a matter of fact, I think for most people the notion of President Quayle is a very very troubling thought.", " Well, John, I'm a man that's been a chief executive for ten years.", "I've picked a lot of people.", "I've picked cabinets.", "I've named judges.", "I know that the people you pick make an enormous difference in your ability to govern and I set high standards.", "I try to meet them and I insist that people who work for me meet them, if they don't, they don't stick around very long.", "Somebody who would come to me if somebody came up with a crazy idea that we ought to trade arms to the Ayatollah for hostages and say, \u00e2\u2030\u00a5Mr.", "President, that's wrong.", "We shouldn't do that.\u00e2\u2030\u00a4 That's the kind of Vice President I want.", "He, himself, has said, and rightly so, that he'll be a strong Vice President.", "When the Vice President makes a decision, that will be his decision.", "And I'm very very proud of that choice.", "The fact is I've picked somebody who not only will be a great Vice President, but if, God forbid, something happens to the president, could step into that office and do so with distinction and with strength and with leadership.", "I doubt very much.", "I doubt very much that Mr. Bush's selection for the Vice Presidency of the United States meets that test.", "I believe it does meet the test.", " I had hoped this had been a little friendlier evening.", "I wanted to hitchhike a ride home in his tank with him.", "But now we've got the lines too carefully drawn here.", "I mean, what kind of judgment-I mean, jumping all over the president on his decision on one area of farm policy.", "I mean, there's-I don't think this is a fair argument.", "But nevertheless, I support my nominee for Vice President and he'll do an outstanding job.", " Well, I think we have to go to work on the problem of Third World debt and we've got to assist those Third World countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currently-which they have incurred and which is burdening them and which if we don't do something about it and assist them along with other nations around the world, we'll destroy their economies, destroy their future.", "And at the same time will destroy markets that are important to our farmers.", "But I also believe we need an agricultural policy which doesn't cost us 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars a year that it's been costing us over the course of the past three or four years under this administration.", "I think it's going to require good, solid credit policies.", "And thanks to the Congress we now have an agricultural credit bill which is helping and improving the situation with at least some of our farmers.", "I think it's going to require a combination of supply management and reasonable price supports to make sure that our farmers get a decent price and I think it also is going to require an administration that understand that there are tremendous opportunities out there for the development of new uses for agricultural products, new uses which can help us to clean up our environment at the same time.", "Bio-degradable plastics-plastic-gasohol, which the Vice President has been involved in, road de-icers made from corn products.", "I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers.", "But I don't think there's anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future for rural communities and for rural America and at the same time working on Third World debt.", " I oppose supply management and production controls.", "I support the farm bill, the 1985 farm bill and spending is moving in the right direction.", "I want to expand our markets abroad and that's why I've called for that first economic summit to be on agriculture.", "I will not go back to the way the Democrats did it and used food as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the farmers in this country.", "I want to see rural redevelopment and I have been out front in favor of alternate sources of energy and one of them is gasohol and comes from using your corn and I think we can do better in terms of biodegradable for a lot of product, so I'm optimistic about the agricultural economy.", "In terms of the Third World, I support the Baker plan.", "I want to see market economies spring up all around the world and to the degree they do, we are succeeding.", "And I don't want to see the banks let off the hook.", "I would oppose that, but I think were on the right track in agriculture and I am very very encouraged.", "Let's try to expand our markets abroad.", " I talked in New Orleans about a gentler and kinder nation and I have made specific proposals on education and the environment and on ethics and energy and how we do better in battling crime in our country.", "I want to keep this expansion going.", "Yes, we want change but we are the change.", "I am the change.", "I don't want to go back to malaise and misery index.", "The best poverty program is a job with dignity in the private sector.", "And in terms of peace, we are on the right track.", "We've achieved an arms control agreement that our critics thought was never possible and I want to build on it.", "I want to see us finalize that START agreement and I want it to be the one to finally lead the world to banishing chemical and biological weapons.", "I want to see asymmetrical reductions in conventional forces.", "And I do favor the death penalty.", "Who has the integrity and stability to get the job done?\u00e2\u2030\u00a4 My fellow Americans, I am that

either of the 2 parties; I was not put on the ballot by any PAC money, by any foreign lobbyist money, by any special interest money.", "This is a movement that came from the people.", "Over time we have developed a government that comes at the people, that comes from the top down, where the people are more or less treated as objects to be programmed during the campaign with commercials and media events and fear messages and personal attacks and things of that nature.", "The thing that separates my candidacy and makes it unique is that this came from millions of people in 50 states all over this country who wanted a candidate that worked and belonged to nobody but them.", "I go into this race as their servant, and I belong to them.", "So this comes from the people.", " The most important distinction in this campaign is that I represent real hope for change, a departure from trickle-down economics, a departure from tax and spend economics, to invest in growth.", "But before I can do that, I must challenge the American people to change, and they must decide.", "You've had your chance and it didn't work.", "It's time to change.", "I want to bring that change to the American people.", "But we must all decide first we have the courage to change for hope and a better tomorrow.", " Well, I think one thing that distinguishes is experience.", "I think we've dramatically changed the world.", "Kids go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war.", "And change for change sake isn't enough.", "We saw that message in the late 70s when heard a lot about change, and what happened, that misery index went right through the roof.", "But my economic program is the kind of change we want.", "And the way we're going to get it done is we're going to have a brand new Congress.", "I'll sit down with them, Democrats and Republicans alike, and work for my agenda for American renewal, which represents real change.", "Values, judgment, and the record that I have amassed in my state also should count for something.", "I've worked hard to create good jobs and to educate people.", "My state now ranks first in the country in job growth this year, fourth in income growth, fourth in reduction of poverty, third in overall economic performance, according to a major news magazine.", "That's because we believe in investing in education and in jobs.", "And we have to change in this country.", "You know, my wife, Hillary, gave me a book about a year ago in which the author defined insanity as just doing the same old thing over and over again and expecting a different result.", "We have got to have the courage to change.", "Experience is important, yes.", "I've gotten a lot of good experience in dealing with ordinary people over the last year and month.",

least we have low interest rates that the Fed can control.", "And there was a terrible reaction internationally to Mr. Bush saying he was going to give us 4 more years of trickle-down

nuclear, but we don't have those things put away yet.", "The sooner the better.", "Number two, we've got to take care of this missile situation and try to get the nuclear war behind us and give this

us a balanced budget.", "Number five, champion small business.", "It's small business that creates the jobs in America, and over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30-year low.", " Now, I'm concerned that the path that we're on has just been unsuccessful.", "The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more -- if you will, trickle-down government -- would work.", "That's not the right answer for America.", "I'll restore the vitality that gets America working again.", "We've got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers.", "And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.", "But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas.", "I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.", "But I also believe that we've got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments.", " So all of this is possible.", "And this is where there's a difference, because Governor Romney's central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut -- on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts -- that's another trillion dollars -- and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn't asked for.", "That's $8 trillion.", "How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign.", "First of all, I don't have a $5 trillion tax cut.", "I don't have a tax cut of a scale that you're talking about.", "My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class.", "But I'm not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people.", "High-income people are doing just fine in this economy.", "They'll do

families are being crushed.", " And so the question is how to get them going again.", "It's energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business.",

government.", "My -- my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit.", "I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit.", "But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans.", "Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families.", "And that's exactly what I did.", "We cut taxes for middle-class families by about $3,600.", "And the reason is, because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well.", "And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car.", "They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through.", "They can buy a computer for their kid who's going off to college, which means they're spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers.", "Now, Governor Romney's proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military.", "And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions.", "The problem is that he's been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasn't been able to identify them.", " When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper-income individuals can -- are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you don't come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending.", " And that's why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romney's pledge of not reducing the deficit or -- or -- or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle-class families.", "The average middle-class family with children would pay about $2,000 more.", "Now, that's not my analysis.", "That's the analysis of economists who have looked at this.", "And -- and that kind of top -- top-down economics, where folks at the top are doing well, so the average person making $3 million is getting a $250,000 tax break, while middle-class families are burdened further, that's not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth.", " Well, but -- but virtually -- virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate.", " So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I'd say absolutely not.", "I'm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut.", "What I've said is I won't put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit.", "So there's no economist that can say Mitt Romney's tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.", "Number two, I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals.", "Look, I've got five boys.", "I'm used to people saying something that's not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately

rates.", " And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate.", "This is about getting jobs for the American people.", " Well, for 18 months he's been running on this tax plan.", "And now, five weeks before the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is, \"Never mind.\"", "It's arithmetic.", "And what I want to do is continue the tax rates -- the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families.", "Under -- under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up.", "Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they're the job creators, they'd be burdened.", "But under Governor Romney's definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses.", "Donald Trump is a small business.", "And I think that would be a mistake.", "But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half -- half of all the people who work in small business.", "Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America.",

Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs.", "I don't want to cost jobs.", "My priority is jobs.", "That's by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.", "But I think math, common sense, and our history shows us that's not a recipe for job growth.", "Look, we've tried this.", "We've tried both approaches.", "The approach that Governor Romney's talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.", " Bill Clinton tried the approach that I'm talking about.", "We created 23 million new jobs.", "We went from deficit to surplus.", "And businesses did very well.", "I'm not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut.", "That's not my plan.", "My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit.", "My plan is not like anything that's been tried before.", "My plan is to bring down rates, but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working.", "My priority is putting people back to work in America.", "They're suffering in this country.", "Look at the evidence of the last four years.", "It's absolutely extraordinary.", "We've got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country.", "It's just -- it's -- we've got -- when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before.", "Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.", "I think it's not just an economic issue, I think it's a moral issue.", "And the amount of debt we're adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral.", "Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit.", "One, of course, is to raise taxes.", "Number two is to cut spending.", "And number is to grow the economy, because if more people work in a growing economy, they're paying taxes, and you can get the job done that way.", "The presidents would -- president would prefer raising taxes.", "The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth.", "And you could never quite get the job done.", "I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.", "Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they don't pass it: Is the program so critical it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it?", "And if not, I'll get rid of it.", "Obamacare's on my list.", "So I'll get rid of that.", "I'm sorry, Jim, I'm going to stop the subsidy to PBS.", "I'm going to stop other things.", "But I'm not going to -- I'm not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for.", "Number two, I'll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state.", " Number three, I'll make government more efficient and to cut back the number of employees, combine some agencies and departments.", "My cutbacks will be done through attrition, by the way.", "This is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget.", "The president said he'd cut the deficit in half.", "Unfortunately, he doubled it.", "Trillion-dollar deficits for the last four years.", "The president's put it in place as much public debt -- almost as much debt held by the public as al prior presidents combined.", " When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me.", "And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis.", "And despite that, what we've said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn't slip into a Great Depression, but what we've also said is, let's make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow.", "So 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but weren't working very well, 18 government -- 18 government programs for education that were well-intentioned, not weren't helping kids learn, we went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars, $50 billion of waste taken out of the system.", "And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget.", "That's the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower.", "And so I've put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan.", "It's on a website.", "You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise.", "And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit.", "Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission.", "Well, that's how the commission -- bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts.", "You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue?", "And he said no.", "Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education.", "It means that Governor Romney...  (CROSSTALK)", " And -- and that is not a right strategy for us to move forward.", " Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that.", " I have my own plan.", "It's not the same as Simpson- Bowles.", "But in my view, the president should have grabbed it.", "If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress, fight for it.", " That's what we've done, made some adjustments to it, and we're putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan...", " You've been president four years.", "You said you'd cut the deficit in half.", "It's now four years later.", "We still have trillion-dollar deficits.", "The CBO says we'll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next four years.", "If you're re-elected, we'll get to a trillion-dollar debt.", " I mean, you have said before you'd cut the deficit in half.", "And this -- I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts.", "You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year.", "That doesn't get the job done.", "You said, \"Look, I'm going to extend the tax policies that we have now; I'm not going to raise taxes on anyone, because when the economy is growing slow like this, when we're in recession, you shouldn't raise taxes on anyone.\"", "Well, the economy is still growing slow.", "As a matter of fact, it's growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement.", "It's not just Donald Trump you're taxing.", "You raise taxes and you kill jobs.", "That's why the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs.", "I don't want to kill jobs in this environment.", " There has to be revenue in addition to cuts.", "Now, Governor Romney has ruled out revenue.", "He's ruled out revenue.", " Look, the revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more taxes.", "That's how we get growth and how we balance the budget.", "But the idea of taxing people more, putting more people out of work, you'll never get there.", "You'll never balance the budget by raising taxes.", "Spain -- Spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government.", "We're now spending 42 percent of our economy on government.", "I don't want to go down the path to Spain.", "I want to go down the path of growth that puts Americans to work with more money coming in because they're working.", "And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes.", "Let's talk about corporate taxes.", "Now, I've identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually help the economy.", "The oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare.", "Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don't get.", "Now, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money, when they're making money every time you go to the pump?", "Why wouldn't we want to eliminate that?", "Why wouldn't we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets?", "My attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it.", "When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue neutral way, close loopholes, deductions -- he hasn't identified which ones they are -- but that thereby bring down the corporate rate.", "Well, I want to do the same thing, but I've actually identified how we can do that.", "And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas.", "Right now, you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas.", "I think most Americans would say that doesn't make sense.", "And all that raises revenue.", " It means that the teacher that I met in Las Vegas, a wonderful young lady, who describes to me -- she's got 42 kids in her class.", "The first two weeks she's got them, some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned.", "They're using text books that are 10 years old.", "That is not a recipe for growth.", "That's not how America was built.", "Ultimately, we're going to have to make some decisions.", "And the magnitude of the tax cuts that you're talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow.", "As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we're talking about potentially a 30 -- a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time.", "And governors are creative.", "There's no doubt about it.", "But they're not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid.", "What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help.", "First of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year.", "And it's actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that's been in place for a hundred years.", " It's time to end it.", " And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world.", "Now, I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas receives.", "Actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth.", " But, you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table.", "Of course it's on the table.", "That's probably not going to survive you get that rate down to 25 percent.", "But don't forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years' worth of breaks, into -- into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1.", "The second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas.", "Look, I've been in business for 25 years.", "I have no idea what you're talking about.", " But -- but the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case.", "I'm not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you're going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you're going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best.", "And I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors -- Republican and Democrats -- said, please let us do that.", "We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor.", "So -- so let's state -- one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy.", "Don't have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have.", "Let states do this.", "And, by the way, if a state gets in trouble, well, we can step in and see if we can find a way to help them.", " But -- but the right -- the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and states, not the federal government.", " You know, I suspect that, on Social Security, we've got a somewhat similar position.", "Social Security is structurally sound.", "It's going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker -- Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill.", "You know, my grandmother -- some of you know -- helped to raise me.", "My grandparents did.", "My grandfather died a while back.", "My grandmother died three days before I was elected president.", "And she was fiercely independent.", "She worked her way up, only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank.", "And she ended up living alone by choice.", "And the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare.", "She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go.", "And that's the perspective I bring when I think about what's called entitlements.", "You know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks.", "These are folks who've worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this.", " So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term?", "And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if we're going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, let's look where some of the money's going.", "$716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we weren't overpaying providers.", "And using that money, we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600, and we were also able to make a -- make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the -- throughout the system.", "So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs.", "When it comes to Social Security, as I said, you don't need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future.", "And the answer is neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare.", "So if you're 60 or around 60 or older, you don't need to listen any further.", "But for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring.", "And that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the president isn't proposing any changes for current retirees.", "In fact he is on Medicare.", "On Social Security he's not.", "But on Medicare, for current retirees, he's cutting $716 billion from the program.", "Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers.", "Actually just going to them and saying, \"We're going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody's going to get a lower rate.\"", "That's not just going after places where there's abuse.", "That's saying we're cutting the rates.", "Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won't take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario.", "We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won't take more Medicare patients.", "Now, you point out, well, we're putting some back.", "We're going to give a better prescription program.", "That's $1 -- that's $1 for every $15 you've cut.", "They're smart enough to know that's not a good trade.", "I want to take that $716 billion you've cut and put it back into Medicare.", "By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it.", "But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake.", "And with regards to young people coming along, I've got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question.", " First of all, I think it's important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future.", "And the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program.", "It's called premium support, but it's understood to be a voucher program.", "The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance.", "Now, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is he'll maintain traditional Medicare alongside it.", "They recruit them, leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare.", "And every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, what'll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse.", " And then what you've got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care.", "So, I don't think vouchers are the right way to go.", "And this is not my own -- only my opinion.", "AARP thinks that the -- the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years.", "Benefits were not affected at all.", "They're now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier.", "And I don't think that's the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term.", " What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare.", "And the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program.", "Number two is for people coming along that are young, what I do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan.", "They get to choose -- and they'll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them.", "So they don't have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000.", "That's not going to happen.", "They'll have at least two plans.", "I know my own view is I'd rather have a private plan.", "I'd just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get.", "I'd rather be able to have an insurance company.", "If I don't like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company.", "We have to have the benefits high for those that are low income, but for higher income people, we're going to have to lower some of the benefits.", "We have to make sure this program is there for the long term.", "That's the plan that I've put forward.", "And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or -- or Senator Wyden, who's the co-author of the bill with -- with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill -- Bill Clinton's chief of staff.", "This is an idea that's been around a long time, which is saying, hey, let's see if we can't get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality.", "I believe in competition.", "And private insurers have to make a profit.", "Nothing wrong with that.", "That's what they do.", "And so you've got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that.", "And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies.", "And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they're stuck.", "And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially.", "And that's why they were supportive of the approach that we took.", "We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare and Medicaid... LEHRER: Talk about that in a minute.", " The president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit.", " If that's the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase.", " But my experience -- my experience the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost.", "You can't have a free market work if you don't have regulation.", "As a businessperson, I had to have -- I need to know the regulations.", "I needed them there.", "You couldn't have people opening up banks in their -- in their garage and making loans.", "I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work.", "Every free economy has good regulation.", " In some places, yes.", "Other places, no.", " No, it can become out of date.", "And what's happened with some of the legislation that's been passed during the president's term, you've seen regulation become excessive, and it's hurt -- it's hurt the economy.", "Let me give you an example.", "Dodd-Frank was passed.", "And it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy.", "One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and they're effectively guaranteed by the federal government.", "This is the biggest kiss that's been given to -- to New York banks I've ever seen.", "This is an enormous boon for them.", "There've been 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd- Frank.", " Well, I would repeal and replace it.", "We're not going to get rid of all regulation.", "You have to have regulation.", "And there are some parts of Dodd-Frank that make all the sense in the world.", "You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits for...", "The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board.", "Now, it wasn't just on Wall Street.", "You had loan officers were -- that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn't have been given, because the folks didn't qualify.", "You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn't afford.", "You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A1 great investments when they weren't.", "But you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didn't even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable.", "We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s.", "We said you've got -- banks, you've got to raise your capital requirements.", "You can't engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk.", "We've going to make sure that you've got to have a living will so -- so we can know how you're going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don't have other taxpayer bailouts.", " In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime, with interest.", "Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank.", "But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back.", "But that's not what I believe.", " Sorry, but that's just not -- that's just not the facts.", "Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street.", "But I wouldn't designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check.", "That's one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank.", "It wasn't thought through properly.", "They're getting hurt.", "Let me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank.", "You say we were giving mortgages to people who weren't qualified.", "That's exactly right.", "It's one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had.", "And so Dodd-Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that's not qualified, there are big penalties, except they didn't ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was.", "It's been two years.", "We don't know what a qualified mortgage is yet.", "So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages.", "Try and get a mortgage these days.", "It's not that Dodd-Frank always was wrong with too much regulation.", "Sometimes they didn't come out with a clear regulation.", "I will make sure we don't hurt the functioning of our -- of our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs.", "Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience.", "You know, I was in New Hampshire.", "A woman came to me and she said, look, I can't afford insurance for myself or my son.", "I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we're thinking of dropping our insurance, we can't afford it.", "And the number of small businesses I've gone to that are saying they're dropping insurance because they can't afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive.", "And -- and we've got to deal with cost.", "And, unfortunately, when -- when -- when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance.", "So it's adding to cost.", "And as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500 a family.", "Instead, it's gone up by that amount.", "So it's expensive.", "Expensive things hurt families.", "Second reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it.", "I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors.", "Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that's going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have.", "I don't like that idea.", "Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country, said, what's been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans?", "And three-quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people.", "I just don't know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the -- at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people.", "It has killed jobs.", "And the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state.", " Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about.", "And it wasn't just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn't get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees.", "It wasn't just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country.", "If they had a pre-existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all.", "If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit.", "And so as a consequence, they're paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they don't have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance companies say that they've hit the limit.", "Number one, if you've got health insurance, it doesn't mean a government takeover.", "You keep your own insurance.", "You keep your own doctor.", "But it does say insurance companies can't jerk you around.", "They can't impose arbitrary lifetime limits.", "They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance -- your insurance plan until you're 26 years old.", "And it also says that you're going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care.", "Number two, if you don't have health insurance, we're essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if you're out there trying to get insurance on the individual market.", " No, I think -- I had five seconds before you interrupted me, was ... (LAUGHTER)  ... the irony is that we've seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there.", "It hasn't destroyed jobs.", "And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold.", " First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts.", "I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together.", "What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote.", "As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary -- elected a Republican senator to stop Obamacare, you pushed it through anyway.", "So entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer and drove it through.", "What we did in a legislature 87 percent Democrat, we worked together; 200 legislators in my legislature, only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished.", "What were some differences?", "We didn't raise taxes.", "You've raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare.", "We didn't cut Medicare.", "Of course, we don't have Medicare, but we didn't cut Medicare by $716 billion.", " We didn't put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they're going to receive.", "We didn't also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put -- put people in a position where they're going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted.", "Right now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year.", "And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage.", "It's why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had -- had the plan.", "They put a plan out.", "They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan.", "It was swept aside.", "I think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis.", "And we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties.", " Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis.", "This was a bipartisan idea.", "In fact, it was a Republican idea.", "And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.", "And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it's the same plan.", "It -- when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we've created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall?", "Because there -- there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis.", "Or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective?", "And there are ways of doing it.", "So at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average.", "And the reason they do is because they do some smart things.", "They -- they say, if a patient's coming in, let's get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests.", "Let's make sure that we're providing preventive care so we're catching the onset of something like diabetes.", "Let's -- let's pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they've -- they've engaged in.", "Now, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let's use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do.", "And the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we're going to be in a position to show that costs are going down.", "And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up -- it's true -- but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years.", "So we're already beginning to see progress.", "In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you're already getting a rebate.", "Governor Romney says, we should replace it, I'm just going to repeal it, but -- but we can replace it with something.", "But the problem is, he hasn't described what exactly we'd replace it with, other than saying we're going to leave it to the states.", "In fact, it's estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you're looking at 50 million people losing health insurance...", " ... at a time when it's vitally important.", "But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan.", "Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan.", "That's already offered in the private marketplace.", "You don't have to have the government mandate that for that to occur.", "But let's come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it's more affordable for families.", "And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have.", " In my opinion, the government is not effective in -- in bringing down the cost of almost anything.", "As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be.", "Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe.", "This is the private market.", "These are small -- these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs.", "I used to consult to businesses -- excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers.", "I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people.", "In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have.", "We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that's happening.", "Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others.", " But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have.", "That's the wrong way to go.", "The private market and individual responsibility always work best.", " Let me just point out first of all this board that we're talking about can't make decisions about what treatments are given.", "That's explicitly prohibited in the law.", "But let's go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions.", "Well, actually Governor, that isn't what your plan does.", "What your plan does is to duplicate what's already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can't deny you if you've -- if it's been under 90 days.", "There's a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts.", "It wasn't a government takeover of health care.", "It was the largest expansion of private insurance.", "But what it does say is that \"insurers, you've got to take everybody.\"", "Now, that also means that you've got more customers.", " It just reminds me of, you know, he says that he's going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan.", "That's how it's going to be paid for, but we don't know the details.", "He says that he's going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don't know exactly which ones.", "He won't tell us.", "He now says he's going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don't have to worry.", "No.", "The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we've got to make choices.", "And the choices we've made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country.", " Which is -- which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and -- and lay down a piece of legislation and say, \"It's my way or the highway,\" I don't get a lot done.", "What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago.", "When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster.", "He said he was going to lower tax rates.", "He said he was going to broaden the base.", "You've said the same thing, you're going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base.", "Those are my principles.", "I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families.", "And I'm going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what -- what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance?", "One way, for instance, would be to have a single number.", "Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000.", "Anybody can have deductions up to that amount.", "And then that number disappears for high-income people.", "That's one way one could do it.", "One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way.", "There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth.", "In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions.", "That's part of my health care plan.", "And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state.", "And I said that at that time.", "The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy.", " Well, I definitely think there are differences.", " The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe.", "That's its most basic function.", "And as commander-in-chief, that is something that I've worked on and thought about every single day that I've been in the Oval Office.", "But I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed.", "Look, the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions.", " But as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together.", "So, in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said, let's help to finance the Transcontinental Railroad, let's start the National Academy of Sciences, let's start land grant colleges, because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans, because if all Americans are getting opportunity, we're all going to be better off.", "That doesn't restrict people's freedom.", "That enhances it.", "And so what I've tried to do as president is to apply those same principles.", "And when it comes to education what I've said is we've got to reform schools that are not working.", "We use something called Race to the Top.", "Wasn't a top-down approach, Governor.", "What we've said is to states, we'll give you more money if you initiate reforms.", "And as a consequence, you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference.", "But what I've also said is let's hire another 100,000 math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed.", "And hard-pressed states right now can't all do that.", "In fact we've seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesn't think we need more teachers.", "I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help.", "Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states.", "And the key to great schools, great teachers.", "So I reject the idea that I don't believe in great teachers or more teachers.", "Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own.", "The role of government: Look behind us.", "The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.", "The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents.", "We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none.", "I do not believe in cutting our military.", "I believe in maintaining the strength of America's military.", "That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose.", "I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can't care for themselves are cared by -- by one another.", "We're a nation that believes that we're all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled.", "We care for them.", "And we -- we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens.", "But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals.", "And what we're seeing right now is, in my view, a -- a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams.", "And it's not working.", "The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty.", "The proof of that is we've gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps.", "The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can't find work.", " We know that the path we're taking is not working.", "It's time for a new path.", " Well, the primary responsibility for education is -- is, of course, at the state and local level.", "But the federal government also can play a very important role.", "And I -- and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, he's -- some ideas he's put forward on Race to the Top, not all of them, but some of them I agree with and -- and congratulate him for pursuing that.", "The federal government can get local and -- and state schools to do a better job.", "I happen to believe, I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I -- these are disabled kids or -- or -- or poor kids or -- or lower-income kids, rather, I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice.", "So all federal funds, instead of going to the -- to the state or to the school district, I'd have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their -- their -- their student.", "So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it we're having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference.", "You know, his -- his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney's talked about.", "And it wasn't very detailed.", "This seems to be a trend.", "And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they're setting up their training programs...", " The -- where they're partnering so that they're designing training programs.", "And people who are going through them know that there's a job waiting for them if they complete it.", "That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support.", "When it comes to making college affordable, whether it's two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed.", "So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system.", "And we said, \"Why not cut out the middleman?\"", "And as a consequence, what we've been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans.", "Governor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that, you know, \"you should borrow money from your parents to go to college,\" you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver, just don't have that option.", "And for us to be able to make sure that they've got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids.", "It's how we're going to grow this economy over the long term.", "All right, I'm not going to cut education funding.", "I don't have any plan to cut education funding and -- and grants that go to people going to college.", "So I'm not planning on making changes there.", "But you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is.", "You put $90 billion into -- into green jobs.", "And I -- look, I'm all in favor of green energy.", "$90 billion, that would have -- that would have hired 2 million teachers.", "$90 billion.", "And these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business.", "A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns.", "Look, the right course for America's government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the economic player, picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world.", "The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective?", "How do we get schools to be more competitive?", "Let's grade them.", "I don't want to cut our commitment to education.", "I wanted to make it more effective and efficient.", "I don't just talk about it.", "I've been there.", "Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation.", " Jim, I had the great experience -- it didn't seem like it at the time -- of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat.", "And that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done.", "We drove our schools to be number one in the nation.", "We cut taxes 19 times.", "And the challenges America faces right now -- look, the reason I'm in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country.", "And we face -- this deficit could crush the future generations.", "What's happening in the Middle East, there are developments around the world that are of real concern.", " And Republicans and Democrats both love America.", "But we need to have leadership -- leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if -- if it's a Republican or a Democrat.", "I've done it before.", "I'll do it again.", "(LAUGHTER)  But, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they're advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class.", "That's how we cut taxes for middle- class families and small businesses.", "That's how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasn't advancing that cause.", "That's how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world.", "That's how we repealed \"don't ask/don't tell.\"", "That's how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and that's how we're going to wind down the war in Afghanistan.", "That's how we went after Al Qaida and bin Laden.", "So we've -- we've seen progress even under Republican control of the House of Representatives.", "But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, \"I'll sit down,\" but you have to have a plan.", "Number two, what's important is occasionally you've got to say no, to -- to -- to folks both in your own party and in the other party.", "And, you know, yes, have we had some fights between me and the Republicans when -- when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of Wall Street?", " And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things.", "And I've got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party.", "You know, four years ago, we were going through a major crisis.", "And yet my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished.", "And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she's gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn't lay off workers during a recession.", "The auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride, that they're helping to build America.", "All those things are designed to make sure that the American people, their genius, their grit, their determination, is -- is channeled and -- and they have an opportunity to succeed.", "And everybody's getting a fair shot.", "And everybody's getting a fair share -- everybody's doing a fair share, and everybody's playing by the same rules.", "You know, four years ago, I said that I'm not a perfect man and I wouldn't be a perfect president.", "And that's probably a promise that Governor Romney thinks I've kept.", "But I also promised that I'd fight every single day on behalf of the American people, the middle class, and all those who were striving to get into the middle class.", "I've kept that promise and if you'll vote for me, then I promise I'll fight just as hard in a second term.", "I -- I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals.", "It's bigger than our respective parties.", "It's an election about the course of America.", "What kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children.", "But they lead in very different directions.", "You can look at the record.", "There's no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected you'll continue to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up.", "I'll get incomes up again.", "You'll see chronic unemployment.", "We've had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent.", "If I'm president I will create -- help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes.", "If the president's reelected, Obamacare will be fully installed.", "In my view that's going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past.", "Many will lose it.", "You're going to see health premiums go up by some $2,500 per family.", "If I'm elected we won't have Obama.", "We'll put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and we'll focus on getting the cost of health care down.", "If the president were to be reelected you're going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare.", "You'll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare Advantage.", "You'll have hospital and providers that'll no longer accept Medicare patients.", "I'll restore that $716 billion to Medicare.", "The president's reelected you'll see dramatic cuts to our military.", "The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating.", "I will not cut our commitment to our military.", "I will keep America strong and get America's middle class working again.", "I think this is an extraordinarily important decision we'll make on November 7th.", "We're really going to choose between what I consider to be an old way of governing ourselves of high levels of spending, high taxes, ever more intrusive bureaucracy or a new course, a new era, if you will.", "And Governor Bush and I want to offer that new course of action.", "We can't make 12-month decisions in this business.", "We're talking about the kinds of fundamental changes in programs and government that are going to affect people's lives for the next 25 or 30 years.", "And while it may be a little risky in some respects from an economic standpoint to try to forecast surpluses, I think we have to make some planning assumption to proceed.", "We haven't moved aggressively on Social Security, on Medicare.", "There are important issues out there that need to be resolved.", "It's important for us to get on with that business.", " I think public education is a solution.", "I'm a product of public schools, my family, wife and daughters all went to public schools.", "We believe very much in the public school system.", "Almost no progress on math.", "The achievement gap between minority and non-minority students is as big as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever been.", "We've had a significant increase in spending for education nationwide, but it has produced almost no positive results.", "That's unacceptable from our standpoint.", "If you look at it and think about it, we now have in our most disadvantaged communities, 70% of our fourth graders can't read at the basic level of understanding.", "We've graduated 15 million kids from high school in the last few years who can't read at a significant level.", "They are permanently sentenced to a lifetime of failure.", "What we want to do is to change that.", "We think we know how to do it.", "Governor Bush has done it in Texas.", "We want to insist on high standards.", "We want accountability.", "We have to test every child every year to know whether or not we're making progress with respect to achieving those goals and objectives.", "We think it's extraordinarily important.", "Probably the single most important issue in this campaign.", "Governor Bush has made it clear that when he's elected this will be his number one priority as a legislative measure to submit to the Congress.", "If you look at our proposal, we take half of the projected surplus and set it aside for Social Security.", "We take roughly a fourth of it for other urgent priorities such as Medicare reform and education, several of these other key programs we want to support.", "And we take roughly one-fourth of it and return it in the form of a tax cut to the American taxpayer.", "We think it's extraordinarily important to do that.", "The fact is that the program that we put together we think is very responsible.", "Suggestion that somehow all of it is going for tax cuts isn't true.", "We want to take about 5% of that and return that to the American taxpayer in the form of tax relief.", "We have the highest level of taxation now we've had since World War II.", "The average American family is paying about 40% in federal, state and local taxes.", "We want to give them the opportunity to make those kinds of choices for themselves and we think this is a totally reasonable approach.", " I share the view that we ought to have equal pay for equal work regardless of someone's gender.", "It's not just about the differential with respect to women.", "If you look at our opponent's tax proposal, they discriminate between stay-at-home moms with children that they take care of themselves and those who go to work or who, in fact, have their kids taken care of outside the home.", "It provides tax relief for absolutely everybody who pays taxes.", "The proposal we have from Al Gore, basically, doesn't do that.", "It in effect lays out some 29 separate tax credits.", "If you live your life the way they want you to live your life, if you behave in a certain way, you qualify for a tax credit and at that point you get some relief.", "The fact of the matter is the plan is so complex that the ordinary American is never going to ever figure out what they even qualify for.", "It's a classic example of wanting to have a program, in this case a tax program, that will, in fact, direct people to live their lives in certain ways rather than empowering them to make decisions for themselves.", "They like tax credits, we like tax reform and tax cuts.", "We want to reduce the incidence of abortion on our society.", "Many on the pro-choice side have said the same thing.", "Even Bill Clinton has advocated reducing abortion to make it as rare as possible.", "That really was a question of whether or not it was safe to be used by women.", "And we also think banning the horrific practice of partial birth abortions is an area where there could be agreement.", "Congress has twice passed by overwhelming margins, a significant number of votes from both parties, the ban on partial birth abortions.", "Twice it's been vetoed by Bill Clinton and Al Gore.", "We would hope eventually they would recognize that's not a good position for them to be in.", "I hope it marks the end of Milosevic.", "I think probably more than anything else it's a victory for the Serbian people.", "They've taken to the streets to support their democracy, to support their vote.", "In some respects this is a continuation of a process that began ten years ago all across eastern Europe and has only now arrived in Serbia.", "We saw it in Germany, we saw it in Rumania, we saw it in Czechoslovakia, as the people of eastern Europe rose up and made their claim for freedom.", "And I think we all admire that.", "I think with respect to how this process has been managed most recently, we want to do everything we can to support Mr. Milosevic's departure.", "Certainly, though, that would not involve committing U.S. troops.", "I do think it's noteworthy that there appears to be an effort underway to get the Russians involved.", "I noted the other night, for example, Tuesday night at the debate in Boston, Governor Bush suggested exactly that we ought to try to get the Russians involved to exercise some leverage over the Serbians.", "It's -- Governor Bush was correct in his assessment and his recommendation.", "He has supported the administration on Kosovo.", "He's been supportive of the policy that we've seen with respect to Yugoslavia.", "And I think he deserves a lot of credit for that.", "I think this is an opportunity for the United States to test President Putin of Russia.", "That in fact now is the time we ought to find out whether he's committed to democracy.", "Whether or not he's willing to support the forces of freedom and democracy diplomatically there in the area of eastern Europe.", "And it's a test for him whether he represents the old guard in the Soviet Union.", "One of the most important challenges we face as a nation is how we manage that process of integrating those 150 million eastern Europeans into the security and economic framework of Europe.", " My preference is to deploy them as warriors.", "The reason we have a military is to be able to fight and win wars.", "And to maintain with sufficient strength so that would-be adversaries are deterred from ever launching a war in the first place.", "I think that the administration has, in fact, in this area failed in a major responsibility.", "We've seen a reduction in our forces far beyond anything that was justified by the end of the Cold War.", "At the same time we've seen a rapid expansion of our commitments around the world as troops have been sent hither and yon.", "There was testimony before the Joint Chiefs of Staff before the Armed Services Committee that pointed out a lot of these problems.", "For example General Mike Ryan of the Air Force with 40% fewer aircraft, he's now undertaking three times as many deployments on a regular basis as he had to previously.", "We're overcommitted and underresourced.", "This has had some other unfortunate effects.", "I saw a letter the other day from a young captain stationed in Fort Bragg, a graduate of West Point in '95 getting ready to get out of the service because he's only allowed to train with his troops when fuel is available for the vehicles and only allowed to fire their weapons twice a year.", "He's concerned that if he had to send them into combat it would mean lives lost.", "That is a legitimate concern, this is a very important area.", "The fact that the U.S. military is worse off today than it was eight years ago.", "I'm not attacking the military, Joe.", "I have enormous regard for the men and women of the U.S. military.", "I had the privilege of working with them for the four years I was the Secretary of Defense.", "No one has a higher regard than I do for them.", "If you have friends and relatives serving in the U.S. military, you know there's a problem.", "If you look at the data that's available, 40% of our Army helicopters are not combat ready.", "The combat readiness level in the Air Force dropped from 85% to 65%.", "Significant problems of retention.", "That's an extraordinarily valuable trust.", "There is no more important responsibility for a President of the United States than his role as Commander in Chief, and the obligation he undertakes on behalf o fall of us when he decides when to send our young men and women to war.", "We will suffer more casualties in the next conflict if we don't look to those basic fundamental problems now.", "As that equipment gets old, it has to be replaced.", "We've taken money out of the procurement budget to support other ventures.", "We have not been investing in the future of the U.S. military.", "Numerous administrations going back certainly to World War II have had to wrestle with the problem of what should happen to the Middle East.", "In effect, we had joined together with Arab allies and done enormous damage to the Iraqi armed forces.", "Iraq was the biggest military threat to Israel.", "They used to fish in troubled waters whenever they had the opportunity in the Middle East.", "We were able to, I think, reassure both Arabs and Israelis would play a major role there.", "We have the ability and the will to deploy forces if we had to, to engage in military operations to help our friends and oppose our foes.", "We were able to convene them in a conference.", "The first time Arab and Israelis sat down face-to-face and began this process of trying to move the peace process forward.", "I think also a lot of credit goes to some great men like Yitzak Rabin.", "His tragic passing was of great consequence, a great tragedy for everybody who cares about peace in the Middle East.", "He was a man who had the military stature to be able to confidently persuade the Israelis to take risks for peace.", "I think Barak has tried to same thing.", "My guess is the next administration is going to be the one that is going to have to come to grips with the current state of affairs there.", "I think it's very important that we have an administration where we have a president with firm leadership who has the kind of track record of dealing straight with people, of keeping his word so friends and allies both respect us and our adversaries fear us.", " We might have no other choice.", "We'll have to see if that happens.", "The thing about Iraq, of course, was at the end of the war we had pretty well decimated their military.", "We had put them back in the box, so to speak.", "Unfortunately now we find ourselves in a situation where that started to fray on us, where the coalition now no longer is tied tightly together.", "Recently the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, two Gulf States, have reopened diplomatic relations with Baghdad.", "The Russians and French are flying commercial airliners back into Baghdad and thumbing their nose at the international sanctions regime, and of course U.N. inspectors have been kicked out and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been absolutely no response.", "We're in a situation today where our posture with Iraq is weaker than it was at the end of the war.", "It's unfortunate.", "I also think it's unfortunate we find ourselves in a position where we don't know for sure what might be transpiring inside Iraq.", "I certainly hope he's not regenerating that kind of capability, but if he were, if in fact Saddam Hussein were taking steps to try to rebuild nuclear capability or weapons of mass destruction, you would have to give very serious consideration to military action to -- to stop that activity.", "I don't think you can afford to have a man like Saddam Hussein with nuclear weapons in the Middle East.", "My assessment is that there is no comprehensive energy policy today.", "We have the prospects of brownouts in California.", "We have a potential home heating oil crisis in the northeast.", "We have gasoline price rises in various other places.", "In fact, we've gone exactly in the opposite direction.", "We have the lowest rate of domestic production of oil now in 46 years.", "You have to go back to 1954 to find a time when we produced as little oil as we do today.", "Our imports are at an all-time record high.", "In June we imported almost 12 million barrels of oil a day.", "That means we are more subject to the wide fluctuations and swings in price.", "We don't have refinery capacity.", "We haven't built a new refinery in this country for over ten years.", "Even with more crude available they're probably not going to be able to do very much by way of producing additional home heating oil for this winter.", "We have a growing problem with our growing dependence on foreign sources of energy.", "That will allways be the case but we ought to be able to shift the trend and begin to move it in the right direction.", "We need to do a lot more about generating the capacity for power here at home.", "We don't think we ought to buy into this false choice that somehow we cannot develop energy resources without being cautious with the environment.", "We have the technology to do it and we ought to do it.", "We do support the low income energy assistance program.", "We think it's important that senior citizens don't suffer this winter, but we need to get on to the business of having a plan to develop our domestic energy resources in producing more supplies, and this administration hasn't produced them.", "I think we have to make choices.", "The Wyoming wilderness bill, frankly was one of my proudest achievements as a member of Congress.", "We think that was important.", "There are a lot of areas around the country where Governor Bush and I support restraint.", "The Arctic National Wildlife Reserve is one of them.", "The infrastructure is there to be able to deliver that product to market.", "We think we can do it given today's technology in a way that will not damage the environment, will not permanently marr the countryside at all, and so what we're looking for with respect to environmental policy and energy policy is balance.", "But we do have to get on with developing those resources or we're going to find ourselves ever more dependent on foreign sources.", "We're going to find that the fact that we don't have an energy policy out there is one of the major storm clouds on the horizon for our economy.", "I think if you look for something that could develop, some problem that could arise, that might, in fact, jeopardize our continuing prosperity, it's the possibility that we might find ourselves without adequate supplies of energy in the future.", "And there would be no quicker way to shut down our economy than that.", "The Social Security system is in trouble.", "It's been a fantastic program and has been there for 65 years that has provided benefits for senior citizens over that period of time.", "It means a great deal to millions of Americans.", "And Governor Bush and I want to make absolutely certain that the first thing we do is guarantee the continuation of those payments, those benefits and keep those promises that were made.", "But if you look down the road, you say you're 30 years old today, and I have two daughters about that age.", "They seriously question whether or not there will be any system left for them.", "That's because the demographics that work out there, it's almost an iron law.", "The reform we would like to offer is to allow our young people to begin to take a portion of the payroll tax, 2% of it, and invest it in a personal retirement account.", "First of all, it gives them a stake in the Social Security system.", "That becomes their property.", "They own it.", "They can pass it on to their kids if they want.", "They don't have that kind of equity in Social Security today.", "Secondly, we can generate a higher return off that investment than you get in the existing system.", "Today you get about a 2% return of what you pay into Social Security.", "We think we can generate at least 6%.", "At least three times what we're able to get now.", "And long-term by generating a bigger return, we'll put additional funds into the system that will help us survive that crunch that is otherwise going to hit in the future.", "With respect to Al Gore and Joe's plan, they don't reform Social Security.", "They add another huge obligation on top of it that future generations will have to pay.", "They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t touch the basic system itself.", "They don't reform it and don't save it.", "We have a plan to do that and a plan to give our young people a choice and more control over their own lives.", "I've been out of Washington for the last eight years and spent the last five years running a company global concern.", "And been out in the private sector building a business, hiring people, creating jobs.", "I have a different perspective on Washington than I had when I was there in the past.", "And you're absolutely right.", "People are fed up.", "He came in when he had a legislature completely controlled by the other party.", "He managed to reach across partisan lines and unite republicans, and democrats and independents and put them to work to achieve good things for the State of Texas.", "Partly because he didn't point the finger of blame looking for scapegoats he was quick to share the credit.", "It is possible to get people to work together and to begin to focus on achieving results.", "I think it will take new leadership.", "I think you have to be able to reach out and work together and build coalitions.", "I think George W. Bush has done it in Texas and can do it at the national level.", " With all due respect, Joe, there's an awful lot of evidence that there hasn't been any bipartisan leadership out of this administration or Al Gore.", "The fact is the Medicare problems have not been addressed.", "We have had eight years of problems with prescription drugs not being addressed.", "Social Security problem\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been addressed.", "The educational problem has not been addressed.", "We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had eight years of talk but no action.", "Medicare is a good example.", "They haven't lead from a bipartisan standpoint and I think Al Gore's record isn't very good.", " I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to try to help you do that, Joe.", "I think that we have to recognize that while we've made enormous progress in the U.S. in racial relations and come a great long way, we still have a very long way to go.", "We still have, I think, a society that -- where we haven't done enough yet to live up to that standard that we'd all like to live up to.", "I think in terms of equality of opportunity, that we judge people as individuals.", "As Martin Luther King said, we ought to judge people on the content of their character instead of the color of their skin.", "I would hope we can continue to make progress int that regard in the years ahead.", "We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to choose, and we shouldn't be able to choose and say you get to live free and you don't.", "That means people should be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to enter into.", "It's no one's business in terms of regulating behavior in that regard.", "I think different states are likely to come to different conclusions, and that's appropriate.", "I don't think there should necessarily be a federal policy in this area.", "I try to be open minded about it as much as I can and tolerant of those relationships.", "And like Joe, I'm also wrestling with the extent to which there ought to be legal sanction of those relationships.", "I think we ought to do everything we can to tolerate and accommodate whatever kind of relationships people want to enter into.", " We clearly come from different political perspectives.", "Joe is a Democrat from New England, I'm a Republican from the west, from Wyoming.", "And I think that weighs into it to some extent.", "Clearly we're both in the positions we're in because of our personal relationships with our principals.", "I think the areas that I would bring are the things that Governor Bush emphasized when he picked me.", "That I have been White House Chief of Staff and ran the White House under President Ford.", "Spent ten years in the House, eight of that in the leadership.", "Served as Secretary of Defense, and then had significant experience in the private sector.", "And that is a set of qualifications that Governor Bush found attractive when he selected me.", "Joe established an outstanding record, I thought, in his work on this whole question of violence in the media.", "And the kinds of materials that were being peddled to our children.", "And many of us on the Republican side admired him for that.", "There is, I must say, the view now that having joined with Al Gore on the ticket on the other side, that the depth of conviction that we had admired before isn't quite as strong as it was, perhaps, in the past.", "We were especially disturbed, Joe, at a recent fundraiser you attended where there was a comedian that got up and criticized George Bush's religion.", "I know you're not responsible for having uttered any words of criticism of his religion.", "My concern would be, frankly, that you haven't been as -- as consistent as you had been in the past.", "That a lot of your good friends like Bill Bennett and others of us who had admired your firmness of purpose over the years have felt that you're not quite the crusader for that cause that you once were.", "This is a very important decision you're going to make on November 7.", "Governor Bush and I want to pursue the new course.", "We want to reform the education system.", "We also want to reform the tax code.", "We think it's very important now that we have a surplus, that a portion of that surplus go back to the people who earned it.", "Finally, we think it's very important to rebuild the U.S. military.", "The military is in trouble.", "The trends are in the wrong direction.", "They deserve the resources that we need to provide for them and they deserve good leadership.", "George Bush is the man to do this.", "I've seen him do it in Texas.", "What we need is to be able to reach across the aisle.", "Put together coalitions of Republicans and Democrats and build the kinds of coalitions that will get something done, finally, in Washington.", "George Bush is good man, an honorable man, a man of great integrity.", "He will make a first rate president.", "In the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half-slave or half-free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, in the direction of the road that we are taking, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery.", "I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain.", "We discuss tonight domestic issues, but I would not want that to be any implication to be given that this does not involve directly our struggle with Mr. Khrushchev for survival.", "Mr. Khrushchev is in New York, and he maintains the Communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the Soviet Union itself.", "The Chinese Communists have always had a large population.", "The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom.", "Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do?", "I should make it very clear that I do not think we're doing enough, that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we're making.", "I'm not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel-mill capacity unused.", "I'm not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world.", "Because economic growth means strength and vitality; it means we're able to sustain our defenses; it means we're able to meet our commitments abroad.", "I'm not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are.", "I'm not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part-time shifts.", "I think we should have an educational system second to none.", "I'm not satisfied when we are failing to develop the natural resources of the United States to the fullest.", "I'm not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights.", "If a Negro baby is born - and this is true also of Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in some of our cities - he has about one-half as much chance to get through high school as a white baby.", "He has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student.", "He has about a third as much chance to be a professional man, about half as much chance to own a house.", "He has about uh - four times as much chance that he'll be out of work in his life as the white baby.", "I think we can do better.", "I don't want the talents of any American to go to waste.", "I don't at all.", "I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities.", "And I want the states to meet their responsibilities.", "But I think there is also a national responsibility.", "I don't believe in big government, but I believe in effective governmental action.", "And I think that's the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom.", "I think we can do a better job.", "And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country.", "Because they felt that the American society was moving again.", "I want us to recapture that image.", "I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how we're doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese Communists.", "That is the obligation upon our generation.", "In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt said in his inaugural that this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny.", "I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous.", "The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack - attack it has ever known?", "I think it can be.", "And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here.", "I think it's time America started moving again.", "There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position.", "We're ahead in this competition, as Senator Kennedy, I think, has implied.", "And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the United States should move ahead.", "I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still.", "But when we look at the growth of G.N.P.", "Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation?", "Is it true that, as far as this country is concerned, in the field of electric power, in all of the fields that he has mentioned, we have not been moving ahead.", "We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years.", "We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history.", "We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration.", "The same is true of highways.", "We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen percent over seven years.", "That shows that there's been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor.", "We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration.", "We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration.", "This means that the average family income went up fifteen per cent in the Eisenhower years as against two percent in the Truman years.", "And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress.", "And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way.", "They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it.", "We both want to help the old people.", "We want to see that they do have adequate medical care.", "I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates.", "Now the Republican platform will cost more too.", "It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than we're presently spending.", "And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans.", "I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress.", "I know what it means to be poor.", "I know what it means to see people who are unemployed.", "I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals.", " Well, the Vice President and I came to the Congress together 1946; we both served in the Labor Committee.", "Secondly, I think the question is uh - what are the programs that we advocate, what is the party record that we lead?", "I come out of the Democratic party, which in this century has produced Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, and which supported and sustained these programs which I've discussed tonight.", "Mr. Nixon comes out of the Republican party.", "He was nominated by it.", "I think Mr. Nixon is an effective leader of his party.", "I hope he would grant me the same.", "First, after each of my foreign trips I have made recommendations that have been adopted.", "For example, after my first trip abroad - abroad, I strongly recommended that we increase our exchange programs particularly as they related to exchange of persons of leaders in the labor field and in the information field.", "After my trip to South America, I made recommendations that a separate inter-American lending agency be set up which the South American nations would like much better than a lend- than to participate in the lending agencies which treated all the countries of the world the same.", "Uh - I have made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian refugee situation which were adopted, not only by the President but some of them were enacted into law by the Congress.", " Well, I would say in the latter that the - and that's what I found uh - somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures uh - Mr. Nixon, that you used in your previous speech, when you talked about the Truman Administration.", "In regard to uh - price stability uh - I'm not aware that that committee did produce recommendations that ever were certainly before the Congress from the point of view of legislation in regard to controlling prices.", "I think it's true of Latin America also.", "There are hundreds of thousands of them.", "They really don't - they're not able to control their market very well.", "They bring their crops in or their livestock in, many of them about the same time.", "I think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture.", "The automobile industry is the number one market for steel.", "So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one.", "Secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance.", "We've had a uh - higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years.", "In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance.", "I don't think it provides effective governmental controls.", " I of course disagree with Senator Kennedy insofar as his suggestions as to what should be done uh - with re- on the farm program.", "I don't think this has worked in the past; I do not think it will work in the future.", "It recognizes that the government has a responsibility to get the farmer out of the trouble he presently is in because the government got him into it.", "Now that we have these surpluses, it's our responsibility to indemnify the farmer during that period that we get rid of the farmer uh - the surpluses.", "But I would propose holding that income up not through a type of program that Senator Kennedy has suggested that would raise prices, but one that would indemnify the farmer, pay the farmer in kind uh - from the products which are in surplus.", "The President has always maintained and very properly so that he is entitled to get what advice he wants from his cabinet and from his other advisers without disclosing that to anybody - including as a matter of fact the Congress.", "Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council.", "I have been in the cabinet.", "I have met with the legislative leaders.", "I have met with the President when he made the great decisions with regard to Lebanon, Quemoy and Matsu, other matters.", "The President has asked for my advice.", "I have given it.", "Sometimes my advice has been taken.", "Sometimes it has not.", "I do not say that I have made the decisions.", "Uh - I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider; Senator Kennedy's is there for the people to consider.", "His has been in the legislative branch.", " Well, I'll just say that the question is of experience and the question also is uh - what our judgment is of the future, and what our goals are for the United States, and what ability we have to implement those goals.", "There are no guarantees that uh - if you take uh - one road or another that you will be a successful president.", "I have voted in the last uh - eight years uh - and the Vice President was uh - presiding over the Senate and meeting his other responsibilities.", "I have met met uh - decisions over eight hundred times on matters which affect not only the domestic security of the United States, but as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.", "I think you have heavy obligations which affect our security, which we're going to have to meet.", "And therefore I've never suggested we should uh - be able to retire the debt substantially, or even at all in nineteen sixty-one or two.", "The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security, and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax.", "I think that's a good investment.", "I think we're going to have to do it.", "And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated.", "On the question of the development of natural resources, I would pay as you go in the sense that they would be balanced and the power revenues would bring back sufficient money to finance the projects, in the same way as the Tennessee Valley.", "I believe in the balanced budget.", "Otherwise, with a steady rate of economic growth - and Mr. Nixon and Mr. Rockefeller, in their meeting, said a five per cent economic growth would bring by 1962 ten billion dollars extra in tax revenues.", "I think what Mr. Novins was referring to was not one of Senator Kennedy's speeches, but the Democratic platform, which did mention cutting the national debt.", "I think, too, that it should be pointed out that of course it is not possible, particularly under the proposals that Senator Kennedy has advocated, either to cut the national debt or to reduce taxes.", "As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes.", "As Senator Kennedy points out that as far as his one proposal is concerned - the one for medical care for the aged - that that would be financed out of Social Security.", "We need higher teachers' salaries.", "But we also want our education to be free of federal control.", "I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession.", "There is another point that should be made.", "I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility.", " it should be more.", "But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program.", "My objection here is not the cost in dollars.", "My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have.", "The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state.", "The state then could determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher salaries.", "On that question the Vice President and I disagreed.", "Secondly, there have been statements made that uh - the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget.", "My view is that you can do these programs - and they should be carefully drawn - within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead.", "And I might say that two-thirds of the Republicans in the House voted against a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage and a majority of the Democrats sustained it - nearly two-thirds of them voted for the dollar twenty-five.", "Secondly, we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate.", "It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives.", "It was killed in the Rules Committee.", "Four Democrats voted for it.", "Every Republican on the Rules Committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the House of Representatives.", "We offered an amendment to do so.", "Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it.", "And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it.", "I would say further that to blame the President in his veto power for the inability of the Senator and his colleagues to get action in this special session uh - misses the mark.", "Because let's consider it.", "The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them; it was because the people were against them.", "It was because they were too extreme.", "We cannot, of course, control the Senate.", "One was a bill for a dollar twenty-five cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business.", "Secondly was the federal aid to education bill.", "I don't say the Democrats are united in their support of the program.", "But I do say a majority are.", "And I say a majority of the Republicans are opposed to it.", "So these are three programs which are quite moderate.", "One party is ready to move in these programs.", "The other party gives them lip service.", "I think it's a matter that we should continue to uh - give uh - great care and attention to.", "We should support uh - the laws which the United States has passed in order to protect us from uh - those who would destroy us from within.", "We should sustain uh - the Department of Justice in its efforts and the F.B.I., and we should be continually alert.", "The major threat is external and will continue.", " I agree with Senator Kennedy's appraisal generally in this respect.",

it's waged right here in the United States.", "That's why we have to continue to be alert.", "We uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow.", "And in that connection I again would say that while Senator Kennedy says we are for the status quo, I do believe that he uh - would agree that I am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education, my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his.", "The question again is not one of goals - we're for those goals - it's one of means.", "And that is growth.", " Well, I must say that the reason that the schools have been constructed is because the local school districts were willing to increase the property taxes to a tremendously high figure - in my opinion, almost to the point of diminishing returns in order to sustain these schools.", "Secondly, I think we have a rich uh - country.", "And I think we have a powerful country.", "The Soviet Union is making great gains.", "I want to compare what we're doing with what our adversaries are doing, so that by the year 1970 the United States is ahead in education, in health, in building, in homes, in economic strength.", "I think that's the big assignment, the big task, the big function of the federal government.", "The Soviet Union has been moving faster than we have.", "But the reason for that is obvious.", "They start from a much lower base.", "That's the same percentage that it was twenty years ago.", "Is this any reason for complacency?", "Not at all Because these are determined men.", "And we have to get the very most of uh - out uh - out of our economy.", "I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score.", "There are many of the points that he has made that I would like to comment upon.", "Our health program - the one that Senator Javits and other Republican Senators, as well as I supported - is one that provides for all people over sixty-five who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it.", "It provides a choice of having either government insurance or private insurance.", "But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it.", "His program under Social Security, would require everybody who had Social Security to take government health insurance whether he wanted it or not.", "And it would not cover several million people who are not covered by Social Security at all.", "Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his.", "The other point that I would make is this: this downgrading of how much things cost I think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when - during the Truman Administration when the government was spending more than it took in - we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation.", "It is essential that a man who's president of this country certainly stand for every program that will mean for growth.", "And I stand for programs that will mean growth and progress.", "I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship.", "I don't want to see the day when it's sixty percent of ours, and seventy and seventy-five and eighty and ninety percent of ours, with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction.", "Secondly, the Vice President mentioned medical care for the aged.", "The Kerr bill provided assistance to all those who were not on Social Security.", "I think it's a very clear contrast.", "Mr. Landon ran in 1936 to repeal it.", "In August of 1960, when we tried to get it again, but this time for medical care, we received the support of one Republican in the Senate on this occasion.", "The means are at question.", "The means are at issue.", "I think you should vote for Mr. Nixon.", "As I said at the beginning, the question before us all, that faces all Republicans and all Democrats, is: can freedom in the next generation conquer, or are the Communists going to be successful?", "That's the great issue.", "And if we meet our responsibilities I think freedom will conquer.", "I want them to say these were the years when the tide came in; these were the years when the United States started to move again.", "It -- Chris Stevens was one of our best.", "We lost three other brave Americans.", "One, we will find and bring to justice the men who did this.", "When you're looking at a president, Martha, it seems to me that you should take a look at his most important responsibility.", "That's caring for the national security of the country.", "And the best way to do that is take a look at how he's handled the issues of the day.", "On Iraq, the president said he would end the war.", "Governor Romney said that was a tragic mistake, we should have left 30,000 -- he ended it.", "Governor Romney said that was a tragic mistake, we should have left 30,000 troops there.", "With regard to Afghanistan, he said he will end the war in 2014.", "Governor Romney said we should not set a date, number one.", "And number two, with regard to 2014, it depends.", "When it came to Osama bin Laden, the president the first day in office, I was sitting with him in the Oval Office, he called in the CIA and signed an order saying, \"My highest priority is to get bin Laden.\"", "Prior to the election, prior to the -- him being sworn in, Governor Romney was asked the question about how he would proceed.", "He said, \"I wouldn't move heaven and earth to get bin Laden.\"", "He didn't understand it was more than about taking a murderer off the battlefield.", "It was about restoring America's heart and letting terrorists around the world know, if you do harm to America, we will track you to the gates of hell if need be.", "And lastly, the president of the United States has -- has led with a steady hand and clear vision.", "Governor Romney, the opposite.", "The last thing we need now is another war.", " When you take a look at what has happened just in the last few weeks, they sent the U.N. ambassador out to say that this was because of a protest and a YouTube video.", "It took the president two weeks to acknowledge that this was a terrorist attack.",

attack.", "Our ambassador in Paris has a Marine detachment guarding him.", "Shouldn't we have a Marine detachment guarding our ambassador in Benghazi, a place where we knew that there was an Al Qaida cell with arms?", "This is becoming more troubling by the day.", "They first blamed the YouTube video.", "Now they're trying to blame the Romney-Ryan ticket for making this an issue.", "With respect to Iraq, we had the same position before the withdrawal, which was we agreed with the Obama administration.", "Let's have a status of forces agreement to make sure that we secure our gains.", "The vice president was put in charge of those negotiations by President Obama and they failed to get the agreement.", "We don't have a status of forces agreement because they failed to get one.", "But what we also want it do is make sure that we're not projecting weakness abroad, and that's what's happening here.", "And that is what we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy, which is making the (inaudible) more chaotic us less safe.", "We should have spoken out right away when the green revolution was up and starting; when the mullahs in Iran were attacking their people.", "We should not have called Bashar Assad a reformer when he was turning his Russian-provided guns on his own people.", "We should always stand up for peace, for democracy, for

lecture on embassy security -- the congressman here cut embassy security in his budget by $300 million below what we asked for, number one.", "Number two, Governor Romney, before he knew the facts,

don't understand what my friend's talking about here.", "We -- this is a president who's gone out and done everything he has said he was going to do.", "This is a guy who's repaired our alliances so the rest of the world follows us again.", "This is the guy who brought the entire world, including Russia and China, to bring about the most devastating -- most devastating -- the most devastating efforts on Iran to make sure that they in fact stop (inaudible).", " Because that was exactly what we were told by the intelligence community.", "The intelligence community told us that.", "As they learned more facts about exactly what happened, they changed their assessment.", "That's why there's also an investigation headed by Tom Pickering, a leading diplomat from the Reagan years, who is doing an investigation as to whether or not there are any lapses, what the lapses were, so that they will never happen again.", " Well, we weren't told they wanted more security there.", "We did not know they wanted more security again.", "That was the assessment.", "And as the intelligence community changed their view, we made it clear they changed their view.", "But as I said, even before we knew what happened to the ambassador, the governor was holding a press conference -- was holding a press conference.", "That's not presidential leadership.", " What -- what we should not be

administration was blocking us every step of the way.", "Only because we had strong bipartisan support for these tough sanctions were we able to overrule their objections and put them in spite of the administration.", "They're stepping up their terrorist attacks.", "They tried a terrorist attack in the United States last year when they tried to blow up the Saudi ambassador at a restaurant in

solve this peacefully -- which is everybody's goal -- you have to have the ayatollahs change their minds.", "They're moving faster toward a nuclear weapon.", "It's because this administration has no credibility on this issue.", "It's because this administration watered down sanctions, delayed sanctions, tried to stop us for putting the tough sanctions in place.", "Now we have them in place because of Congress.", "They say the military option's on the table, but it's not being viewed as credible.", "And the key is to do this peacefully, is to make sure that we have credibility.", "Under a Romney administration, we will have credibility on this issue.", "Look, imagine had we let the Republican Congress work out the sanctions.", "You think there's any possibility the entire world would have joined us, Russia and China, all of our allies?", "These are the most crippling sanctions in the history of sanctions, period.", " We want to prevent war.", "How are they going to prevent war if

requires a new approach in Washington, D.C.", "It's going to require somebody who can work across the partisan divide.", "Under my plan I will put Medicare in an iron clad lockbox and prevent the

called Immediate Helping Hand.", "Instead of squabbling and finger pointing, he gets immediate help.", "They get $25,000 a year income, that makes them ineligible.", " Look, this is a man who has great numbers.", "He talks about numbers.", "I'm beginning to think not only did he invent the Internet, but he invented the calculator.", "It's fuzzy math.", "It's a scaring -- he's trying to scare people in the voting booth.", "Under my tax plan that he continues to criticize, I set one-third.", "The federal government should take no more than a third of anybody's check.", "But I also dropped the bottom rate from 15% to 10%.", "Because by far the vast majority of the help goes to people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.", "If you're a family of four in Massachusetts, making $50,000, you get a 50% cut in the federal income taxes you pay.", "It's from $4000 to about $2000.", "Now, the difference in our plans is I want that $2,000 to go to you, and the vice president would like to be spending the $2,000 on your behalf.", " It's just clear you can go to the website and look.", "If you make more than $25,000 a year you don't get a penny of help under the Bush prescription drug proposal for at least four to five years, and then you're pushed into a Medicare -- into an HMO or insurance company plan, and there's no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the conditions.", "And the insurance companies say it won't work and they won't offer these plans.", " The difference is I want to bring it to 100% and he wants to bring it to 5%.", " That's totally false

seniors.", "All seniors are covered under prescription drugs in my plan.", "Yours is phased in in eight years.", " It's a two-phase plan.", "For the first four years -- it takes a year to pass it and for the first four years only the poor are covered.", "Middle class seniors like George McKinney and his wife are not covered for four to five years.", "My plan has not only a short-term component, but also a long-term component.", "And it focuses not only on increasing the supply, which I think we have to do, but also on working on the consumption side.", "Now, in the short-term we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price from OPEC when they want to raise the price.", "And in the long-term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy.", "And domestic sources that are cleaner and better.",

much pollution, that don't burn as much energy, and that help us get out on the cutting edge of the new technologies that will create millions of new jobs.", "Because, when we sell these new products here, we'll then be able to sell them overseas.", "There is a ravenous demand for them overseas.", "Now, another big difference is Governor Bush is proposing to open up some of our most precious environmental treasures, like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for the big oil companies to go in and start producing oil there.", "I think that is the wrong choice.", "It would only give us a few months' worth of oil and the oil wouldn't start flowing for many years into the future.", "I don't think it's a fair price to pay to destroy precious parts of America's environment.", " It's an issue I know a lot about.", "I was a small oil person for a while in west Texas.", "This is an administration that's had no plan.", "And all of a sudden the results of having no plan have caught up with America.", "First and foremost we have to fully fund LIHEAP which is a way to help low income folks, particularly here in the east to pay for high fuel bills.", "Secondly, we need an active exploration program in America.", "The only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home.", "You bet I want to open up a small part of Alaska.", "When that field is online it will produce one million barrels a day.", "Today we import one million barrels from Saddam Hussein.", "I would rather that a million come from our own hemisphere, our own country as opposed to Saddam Hussein.", "I want to build more pipelines to move natural gas throughout this hemisphere.", "I want to develop the coal resources in America.", "Have clean coal technologies.", "I'm for doing something both on the supply side and production side and on the consumption side.", "Let me say, that I found one thing in Governor Bush's answer that we certainly agree on, and that's the low income heating assistance program.", "I worked to get $400 million just a couple of weeks ago.", "And to establish a permanent home heating oil reserve here in the northeast.", "Now, as for the proposals that I've worked for for renewables and conservation and efficiencies and new technologies.", "The fact is for the last few years in the Congress, we've faced a lot of opposition to them.", "They've only approved about 10% of the agenda I've helped to send up there.", " Well I would first say he should have been tackling it for the last seven years.", "Secondly the difference is we need to explore at home.", "And the vice president doesn't believe in exploration in Alaska.", "There's a lot of shut-in gas that we need to be moving out of Alaska by pipeline.", "There's an interesting issue up in the northwest as well.", "I'm against removing dams in the northwest.", "I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know where the vice president stands but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a renewable energy source

technologies.", "I'm going to ask the Congress for $2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal technologies in the world.", "My answer to you is in the short-term we need to get after it here in America.", "We need to explore our resources and we need to develop our reservoirs of domestic production.", "We also need to have a hemispheric energy policy where Canada, Mexico and the United States come together.", "I brought this up recently with Vincent Fox the newly elected president in Mexico, he's a man I know from Mexico.", "I talked to him about how best to expedite the exploration of natural gas in Mexico and transport it up to the United States so we become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil.", "This is a major problem facing America.", "The administration did not deal with it.", "It's time for a new administration to deal with the energy problem.", "I strongly support new investments in clean coal technology.", "I made a proposal three months ago on this.",

dependency upon foreign sources of crude is good for consumers.", "And we can do so in an environmentally friendly way.", "I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America.", "Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country.", "Life of the unborn.", "As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life.", "I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America.", "What I do believe is that we can find good, common ground on

abortions in America.", "They determined it was medically safe for the women who use that drug.", "First of all on the issue of partial birth or so-called late-term abortion, I would sign a law banning that procedure, provided that doctors have the ability to save a woman's life or to act if her health is severely at risk.", "That's not the main issue.", "The main issue is whether or not the Roe v.

Wade.", " It sounds like the vice president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not right very many times tonight.", "I just told you the criteria on which I'll appoint judges.", "I have a record of appointing judges in the State of Texas.", "That's what a governor gets to do.", "A governor gets to name supreme court judges.", "He also reads all kinds of things into my tax plan and into my Medicare plan.", " It would be likely that they would uphold Roe v.

no mistake about it.", "He'll put liberal activists justices who will use their bench to subvert the legislature, that's what he'll do.", "His opponent, Kostunica, has won the election.", "It's overwhelming.", "Milosevic's government refuses to release the vote count.", "There's now a general strike going on.", "They're demonstrating.", "I think we should support the people of Serbia and

this guy out of office.", "Now he is trying to not release the votes and then go straight to a so-called runoff election without even announcing the results of the first vote.", "Now, we've made it clear, along with our allies, that when Milosevic leaves, then Serbia will be able to have a more normal relationship with the rest of the world.", "That is a very strong incentive that we've given them to do the right thing.", "So we have to be intelligent in the way we go about it.", "But make no mistake about it, we should do everything we can to see that the will of the Serbian people expressed in this extraordinary election is done.", "It's time for the man to go.", "It means that the United States must have a strong diplomatic hand with our friends in NATO.", "That's why it's important to make sure our alliances are as strong as they possibly can be to keep the pressure on Mr. Milosevic.", "But this will be an interesting moment for the Russians to step up and lead as well.", "Be a wonderful time for the Russians to step into the Balkans and convince Mr. Milosevic that it's in his best interest and his country's best interest to leave office.", "The Russians have a lot of sway in that part of the world.", "We would like to see the Russians use that sway to encourage democracy to take hold.", "It's an encouraging election.", "It's time for the man to leave.", " In this particular situation, no.", "Bear in mind that we have a lot of sanctions in force against Serbia right now.", "And the people of Serbia know that they can escape all those sanctions if this guy is turned out of power.", "They currently favor going forward with a runoff election.", "I think that's the wrong thing.", "But I think we need to be very careful in the present situation before we invite the Russians to play the lead role in mediating.", " It's not in our national interest to use force in this case.", "I would use pressure and diplomacy.", "There is a difference with what the president did in Kosovo which I supported and this.", "It's up to the people in this region to take control of their country.", " Well, if it's in our vital national interests, and that means

careful when we commit our troops.", "The vice president and I have a disagreement about the use of troops.", "He believes in nation building.", "I would be very careful about using our troops as

Reagan-Bush ticket.", "And there was a long, deathly silence and she said come on, we delivered.", "That's the problem.", "And I'm not blaming her except for the liberal voting record in the House.",

for the future of this country.", "And this administration over the past several years has gutted the educational programs available to our young people.", "It has attempted to knock out Pell Grants, which are monies to young individuals who are poor and who cannot afford to go to college.", "It has reduced by 25 percent the amount of monies going into college education and by a third those going into secondary and primary schools.", "But Fritz Mondale and I feel very strongly that if you educate your children that that's an effort and the way that you build up and make a stronger America.", "This administration does not.", "It has come in in the Bob Jones on the side of segregated academies.", "It came in in the Grove City case on the side of discrimination against women, the handicapped, and the elderly.", "As a matter of fact, in the Congress we just passed overwhelmingly the Civil Rights Bill of 1984 and this administration, the Republican-controlled Senate, just killed it in the last week or two in Congress.", "So there is a real difference between how the Mondale-Ferraro administration will address the problems of civil rights and the failure of this administration

should be taken both through government - for instance, the Small Business Administration.", "We have supported set-asides for minority and women's businesses.", "That's a positive thing.", "We don't feel that you're in any way hurting anybody else by reaching out with affirmative action to help those who've been disenfranchised.", "And affirmative action is a very positive way to deal with the

put in a thing called the Job Training Partnership Act.", "Wonderful new legislation that's helping blacks more and more.", "We think of civil rights as something like crime in your neighborhoods.",

offended or feel left out or feel uncomfortable.", "But, yes, prayer in school on a voluntary basis worked for many, many years until the Supreme Court ruled differently And I'm glad we got this question because I think there's been too much said about religion and politics.", "We don't believe in denominationally moving in.", "It wasn't our side that raised the question about our president

president's position - and comfortably - from a moral standpoint.", " No, I support the president's position.", " Let me say first of all I believe very, very sincerely in the separation of church and state.", "I'm taking it from the historical viewpoint, if you go back to the 1600s when people came here, the reason they came to this country was to escape religious persecution, and that's the same reason why people are coming here today in the 1940s to escape Nazism, now in the 1980s and 1984 when they can get our of the country to escape communism so they can come here and practice their religion.", "Our country is founded on the principle that our government should be neutral as far as religion is concerned.", "What has happened over the past four years has been I think a real fudging of that line with the separation of church and state.", "I have absolutely no problem with them speaking up, I think they have an obligation as well as a right.", "But what I do have a problem with is when the president of the United States gets up in Dallas and addresses a group of individuals and said to them that anybody who doesn't support his constitutional amendment for prayer in the schools is intolerant of religion.", "Now there are numerous groups who don't support that prayer in the school, numerous religious groups.", "I also object, when I am told, that the Reverend Falwell

district, not only the Catholics.", " Well I respect that statement, I really and truly do.", "And I don't know where this canard could have come from about Mr. Falwell picking the Supreme Court

House, I believe, went out of session today, so I don't know if they will move.", "But quite frankly, I would like that to be taken care of anyway, because I just want it cleared up.", "I have to tell you what we have done since I have hired a marvelous accountant.", "I've spent a lot of money having him go through all those ethics forms and he will be doing my taxes over the next eight years while we're in the White House so that the American public can be sure it's all been taken care of.", "He also made a reference that troubled me very much, Mr. Boyd.", "They saved the life of the president of the United States.", "I think that was a cheap shot - telling the American people to try to divide class - rich and poor.", "But the big question isn't whether Mrs. Ferraro is doing well.", "I think they're doing pretty well, and I know Barbara and I are doing well.", "And it's darn sure that Mr. Mondale is doing well, with a million four in income, but the question really is - after we get through this disclosure - is the tax cut fair?", "So yes, I favor disclosure.", "I've always disclosed.", "The trust has been revealed, and I was sure glad to see that I had paid 42 percent of my gross income in taxes.", "And residence, Mr. Boyd, legal residence, for voting, is very different.", "And the domicile, they call that, very different, than the house.", "That they say you're living in the vice-president's house.", "Therefore you don't get what every - I've got problems - what every other taxpayer gets.", "I got problems with the IRS, but so do a lot of people out there.", "I think I've paid too much.", "I think the question is whether or not the tax cuts and the tax system that's currently in our government, that our government uses, is fair; I think the tax system is unfair.", "But it's not something that we can address in the short term.", "If you earn $200,000 a year, you got a $25,000 tax cut.", "If you earned between $20,000 and $40,000, you may have gotten about $1,000 between ten and twenty, close to a hundred dollars and if you made less than $10,000 with all the budget cuts that came down the line, you suffered a loss of $400.", "That's not fair.",

reasons we're facing these enormous deficits that we have today.", "I believe in it.", "Before I went into this job, I disclosed everything we had.", "We didn't have any private corporations, but I disclosed absolutely everything.", "Arthur Andersen made out an assets and liabilities statement that I believe went further than any other one.", "I believe in the blind trust because I believe a

difficult to slop.", "And I think everybody knows that.", "We had ambassadors killed in Sudan and the Lebanon some time ago, a long time ago.", "I believe we ought to strengthen it and I believe we still have the best foreign intelligence business in the world.", "But it is very difficult to get the source information that you need to go after something as shadowy as international terror.",

the government negotiating with the United States government for their release.", "In Lebanon, in the terror that happened at the embassy, you have the government there, Mr. Gemayel, that wants to help fight against terrorism.", "So what we've got to do is use absolutely the best security possible.", "I don't think you can go assigning blame.", "The president, of course, is the best I've ever seen at accepting that.", "He's been wonderful about it in absolutely everything that happens.", "But I think fair-minded people that really understand international terror know that it's very hard to guard against.", "And the answer then really lies in the Middle East and terrorism happening all over the world, is a solution to the Palestine question, the follow on to Camp David under the umbrella of the Reagan September of 1982 initiative.", "That will reduce terror, it won't eliminate it.", "But we do believe in reaching out to the, what they call the GCC, those Gulf Cooperative Council State, those moderate Arab states in that world, and helping them with defensive weapons to guard against international terror or radical Islam perpetuated by Khomeini.", "It was at that time that President Reagan gave a speech welcoming them home - as America did, we were so excited to see them back.", "But what he said was: The United States has been embarrassed for the last time.", "We're going to stand tall and if this ever happens again, there's going to be swift and immediate steps taken to address the wrong that our country has founded - has suffered.", "In April of J983 I was in Beirut and visited the ambassador at the embassy.", "Two weeks later, that embassy was bombed.", "They're going to do crazy things and you just don't know what's going to happen.", "The following October, there was another bombing and that bombing took place at the marine barracks, where there were 242 young men who were killed.", "Right after that bombing occurred, there was a commission set up called the Long Commission.", "That commission did a study of the security arrangements around where the marines were sleeping and found that there was negligence, that they did not have proper gates up, proper precautions to stop those trucks from coming in.", "Well, last month we had our third bombing, The first time, the first embassy, there was no gate up, The second time, with our Marines, the gate was open.", "The third time, the gate was there but it had not been installed.", "And what was the president's reaction?", "Well, the security arrangements were not in, our people were placed in that embassy in an unsecured time, and the marines who were guarding it were left to go away and there were other people guarding the embassy.", "Again the president said: I assume responsibility.", "Are we going to take proper precautions before we put Americans in situations where they're in danger, or are we just going to walk away, throwing our arms in the air now - quite a reversal from the first time, from the first time when he said he was going to do something?", "Or is this President going to take some action?", " I think they have a legitimate role in gathering information.", "And what has happened was the CIA, in the last bombing, had given information to our administration with reference to the actual threats that that embassy was going to be bombed.", "So it wasn't the CIA that was at fault.", "There's legitimate reason for the CIA to be in existence, and that's to gather intelligence information for our security.", "The CIA is there, it's meant to protect our government; not there to subvert other governments.", "I think I just heard Mrs. Ferraro say that she would do away with all covert actions, and if so, that has very serious ramifications, as the intelligence community knows.", "This is serious business.", "And let me say further that no one has ever said that those young men who were killed through the negligence of this administration and others ever died in shame.", "No one who has a child who is nineteen or twenty years old, a son, would ever say that at the loss of anybody else's child.", " I would advocate the use of force when it was necessary to protect the security of our country, protect our security interest or protect our people or protect the interests of our friends and neighbors.", "- when Mr. Mondale, Mr. Mondale referred to the quarantine of Central America, a country in Central America, what he is referring to is a last resort after all other means of attempting to settle the situation down in that region of the world had been exhausted.", "Quite frankly now what is being done by this administration is an Americanizing of a regional conflict.", "Instead of supporting the process, our administration has in Nicaragua been supporting covert activities to keep that revolution going in order to overthrow the Sandinista government; in El Salvador was not pushing the head of the government to move toward correction of the civil rights; human rights problems that existed there, and now this administration seems almost befuddled by the fact that Nicaragua is moving to participate in the Contadora process, and El Salvador is, through its President Duarte, is reaching out to the guerrillas in order to negotiate a peace.", "What Fritz Mondale and I feel about the situation down there is that what you do is you deal first through negotiation.", "That force is not a first resort but certainly a last resort in any instance.", "I mean they do have elections that are coming up on November 4.", "I think we have to work with them to achieve a peaceful solution to bring about a pluralistic country.", "No, I'm not willing to live with a force that could be a danger to our country.", " I support what we're doing.", "It was supported to the Congress and under the law.", "I support it.", "My only regret is that the aid for the contras, those people that are fighting, we call them freedom fighters.", "They want to see the democracy perfected in Nicaragua.", "Am I to understand from this assault on covert action that nowhere in the world would we do something that was considered just off base when Mrs. Ferraro said she's never support it?", "Would she never support it if the violation of human rights was so great and quiet support was necessary for freedom fighters?", "Yes, we're for the contras.", "Everyone that's not for this, everyone who wants to let that Sandinista government prevail, just like that Castro did, all of that, the contras are not Somozistas.", "Less than 5 percent of the contras supported Somoza.", "These were people that wanted a revolution.", "These people that felt the revolution was betrayed.", "These are people that support human rights.", "Yes, we should support them.", "Let me just say that the situation as it exists now, because of this administration's policies, are not getting better.", "We're not moving toward a more secure area of the world.", "As a matter of fact the number of troops that the Sandinistas have accumulated since the administration started its covert activities has risen from 12,000 to 50,000, and of course the number of Soviet and Cuban advisors has also increased.", "I did not support the mining of the harbors in Nicaragua; it is a violation of international law.", "So if Congress doesn't get laid on, the covert activities which I opposed in Nicaragua, those CIA covert activities in that specific country, are not supported by the Congress.", "And believe it or not, not supported by the majority of people throughout the country.", " Well, I would simply like to make the distinction again between those countries that are searching for democracy and the handful of countries that have totally violated human rights and are going the Marxist route.", "Ortega, the commandante who is head of the Nicaraguan Sandinistas, is an avowed Marxist.", "They don't believe in the church.", "They don't believe in free elections.", "They don't believe in all of the values that we believe in.", "So it is our policy to support the democracy there, and when you have freedom fighters that want to protect that revolution, and go the democratic route, we believe in giving them support.", "We are for democracy in the hemisphere.", "We are for negotiations.", "$3 out of every $4 that we sent down there has been for economic aid to support the people's chance to eat and live and be happy and enjoy life.", "And one-fourth only was rnilitary.", "You wouldn't get that from listening to Mr. Mondale.", "The Soviets have not been willing to talk.", "We are the ones that went to the table in INF.", "We had a good proposal, a moral proposal.", "Ban an entire generation of intermediate nuclear force weapons and if you won't do that, don't leave your allies in Europe in a monopoly position.", "The Soviets with 1,200 of these things, and the alliance with none.", "We didn't think that's the way to deter aggression and keep the peace.", "The president went, the first thing he did when he came into office was make a proposal on the most destabilizing weapons of all, START.", "And when the the strategic weapon and when the Soviets said, well, we don't like that proposal, we said all right, we'll be more flexible.", "I at the urging of the president went to Geneva and laid on the table a treaty to ban all chemical weapons.", "We don't want them to have a monopoly.", "We said look, let's come together.", "You come over here and see what we're doing; we'll go over there and see what you're doing.", "But let's save the kids of this world from chemical weapons.", "A brilliant proposal to get rid of all of them.", "In the mutual balance force reduction to reduce conventional forces, they're not even willing to tell us the base.", "We have had an agreement with them on the hot line.", "It was flawed, it was unverifiable and it was not good.", "Our president wants to reduce, not just to stop, he wants to reduce dramatically nuclear weapons.", "And when the Soviets know they're going to have this strong president to deal with, and when this new administration, Mr. Chernenko, given more than a few months in office can solidify its position, then they'll talk.", "But if they think the opposition, before they sit down, are going to give up the MX, give up the B-l, go for a freeze that locks in inferiority in Europe, all of these things, unilaterally, before they're willing to talk, they may just sweat it out for four more weeks.", " No, I don't think it's winnable.", "The Soviet planning, I did learn that when I was director of Central Intelligence, and I don't think there'd be any disagreement, is based on that ugly concept.", "But I agree with the president: It should never be fought.", "Nuclear weapons should never be fought with, and that's our approach.", "So, therefore, let's encourage the Soviets to come to the table as we did at the Gromyko meeting.", "I wish everybody could have seen that one - the President, giving the facts to Gromyko in all of these nuclear meetings - excellent, right on top of that subject matter.", "And I'll bet you that Gromyko went back to the Soviet Union saying, \"Hey, listen, this president is calling the shots; we'd better move.\"", "Because I think it is in the interest of the Soviet Union to make it, just as it is in the United States.", "They're not deterred by rhetoric.", "I listened to the rhetoric for two years at the United Nations.", "I've lived in a Communist country.", "It's not rhetoric that decides agreements, it's self-interest of those countries.", " Let me say first of all that I don't think there is any issue that is more important in this campaign, in this election, than the issue of war and peace.", "And since today is Eleanor Roosevelt's 100th birthday, let me quote her.", "She said, \"It is not enough to want peace, you must believe in it.", "And it is not enough to believe in it, you must work for it.\"", "This administration's policies have indicated quite the opposite.", "Now, let me just say that with reference to the vice-president's comments about the intent and the desire of the United Sites and this administration, the Soviet Union did walk out of the talks.", "I agree.", "But it seems to me in 1982, when the administration presented its Start proposal, that it wasn't a realistic proposal.", "But that aside, in 1982, I believe it was, their own negotiator, Nitze, came out with a proposal called the \"walk-in-the-woods proposal\" which would have limited the number of nuclear arms in Europe.", " Well, I think there's quite a difference between Mr. Kyprianou in Cyprus and the leader of the free world, Ronald Reagan, in terms of meeting.", "And the Soviet Union - the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will meet with a lot of different people.", "We've been in very close touch with Mr. Mitterrand, Mr. Kohl, and others that have met with the leaders of the Soviet Union.", "But that's quite different than meeting with the president of the United States.", "The Soviets say we'll have a meeting when we think there can be progress and yet they left those talks.", "It was the Soviet Union that was unwilling to discuss the walk in the woods.", "They were the ones that gunned it down first and the record is very, very clear on that.", "Miss Ferraro mentioned the inflexibility of our position on strategic arms.", "Yes, we offered first to get rid of all those - we tried to reduce the SS-18's and those weapons.", "But then we said if that's not good enough, there is flexibility, let's talk about the bombers and planes.", "So that's a very important point in terms of negotiation.", " I think first of all, you have to take a look at the current situation.", "We now have 50,000 nuclear warheads; we are building at the rate of five or six a day between us and we have been doing that since this administration came into office.", "I think what you can do is look at what they've done and recognize that they're not going to do very much in the future.", "And so, since they've done nothing, do we continue to build because an arms race doesn't lead to anything, it leads to another arms race and that's that.", "Vice President Monad has indicated that what he would do, first of all, as soon as he.", "gets into office, is contact his Soviet counterpart and set up an annual summit meeting.", "I don't think you can start negotiating until you start talking.", "That was done in 1960.", "What that would do is it would give us the opportunity to sit down and negotiate a treaty.", "That was done in 1960 by President Kennedy - in 1963.", "What he did was he issued a challenge to the Soviet Union.", "He said we will not test in space - in the atmosphere, if you will not.", "They did not.", "In two months they sat down and they negotiated a treaty.", "We do not now have to worry about that type of testing.", " it will be done, if only you have the will to do it.", "Again, remember it is mutual; it is verifiable and it is a challenge that once that challenge is not met, if testing were to resume, then we would continue testing as well.", "I think what happens is when you try to equate whether or not I have had military experience, that's the natural conclusion.", "It's about as valid as saying that you would have to be black in order to despise racism, that you'd have to be female in order to be terribly offended by sexism.", "And that's just not so.", "I think if you take a look at where I've been, both in the Congress and where I intend to go, the type of person I am - I think that the people of this country can rely upon the fact that I will be a lender.", "I don't think the Soviet Union for one minute can sit down and make determination on what I will do if I'm ever in a position to have to do something with reference to the Soviet Union.", "Quite frankly I'm prepared to do whatever is necessary in order to secure this country and make sure that security is maintained.", "Secondly, if the Soviet Union were to ever believe that they could challenge the United States with any sort of nuclear forces or otherwise, if I were in a position of leadership in this country, they would be assured that they would be met with swift, concise and certain retaliation.", "The most important thing, though I think as a leader that what one has to do is get to the point where you're not put into that position.", "And the way you to that position of rnoving away from having to make a decision - armed force or anything else - is by moving toward arms control.", "And that's not what's been done over the past four years.", "I think that if you were to take a look at the failures of this administration that would have to be number one.", "I will not put myself in that position as a leader in this country.", "I will move immediately toward arms control negotiations.", "I guess the concern that I have is a concern not only as a vice-presidential candidate but as a citizen in this country.", "I guess the thing that I'd want is a commitment that pretty soon they're going to do something about making this a safer world for all of us.", " No, I think his strategy not only was correct but is correct.", "You've got to go back where we were.", "Clearly, when we came into office, the American people recognized that we had slipped into positions of inferiority on various things.", "Some of our planes, as the president points out, were older than the pilots; ships that couldn't go out to sea.", "And you had a major problem with the military.", "Actually, the morale wasn't very good either.", "So we have had to strengthen the military and we're well on the way to getting that job done.", "America is back in terms of military strength, in terms of our ability to deter aggression and keep the peace.", "The Strategic Arms Reduction Talks were good proposals, and it's the Soviets who left the table.", "And we wish they would think anew and move forward to verification so everybody would know whether the other side was keeping its word.", "But, much more important, you'd reduce the level of terror.", "We've talked to them about human rights.", "I've met with Mr. Andropov and Mr. Chernenko, and we mention and we try to do something about the human rights question.", "The Soviets made an ABM treaty when they felt we were going to deploy an ABM system.", "So I am optimistic for the future, once they realize that they will have this strong, principled president to negotiate with, strong leadership, and yet with demonstrable flexibility on arms control.", "Let me put it this way - I don't have any questions, but we are so different from - the Reagan-Bush administration is so different from the Carter-Mondale [sic] administration that the American people are going to have the clearest choice.", "It's a question of going back to the failed ideas of the past, where we came in - 21% percent on those interest rates, inflation, despair, malaise, no leadership, blaming the American people for failed leadership.", "Or another option - keep this recovery going until it benefits absolutely everybody.", "Peace at home - peace abroad - prosperity - opportunity.", " I think the vice-president's comment about the Carter-Mondale administration really typifies this administration.", "It's an administration that looks backwards, not forwards and into the future.", "I must say that I'm also tickled by their comments on human rights.", "That's not a great record on human rights and certainly not a record on human rights achievements.", " Well, in a couple of weeks, you, the American people, will be faced, three weeks, with a choice.", "It's
